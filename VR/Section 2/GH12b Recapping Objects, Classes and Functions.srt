Hey guys, congratulations on completing yet another

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
quiz! And how many more concepts have we learned in these last few

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
videos? It's incredible, we've learned about objects, methods, everything, you know!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Basically, you have most of the basics of programming now, so make sure

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
you understand them very well. So again, the same advice as I gave you in the last quiz,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
just make sure that, if anything is unclear, you go back

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and review it, because it's really important to get the basics right, and there's always

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
just using the forums and the Q & A to make sure you

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
really check your understanding. So we've got a working game, how great! Now, we're going to go

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in and consolidate all that knowledge in the next few videos and really

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
understand how this all fits together and how to make our

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
code, that little bit better, that little bit more maintainable and readable. So

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,833
let's dive right in!
