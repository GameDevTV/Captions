00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.133
Welcome to Go Home, our first section where we're actually really going to get

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.133
stuck into making something! In this section what are we going to do, Ben? Well, by the end if it we'll be

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:12.133
making this game here that we're showing you now, which is a simple but powerful game

4
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:16.133
that let's you play with vectors, to try to work out, You start off lost

5
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:20.133
and workout where home is, so that's what we're going to be doing. And what do they learning,

6
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:24.133
Sam? So, through this process you're going to be learning about the basics of

7
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:28.133
C#, which is an industry standard programming language, very super useful.

8
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:32.133
And what else? And also vector math, more vector math,

9
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:36.133
Over here in the UK, and that's very fundamental to virtual reality game

10
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:40.133
designs. So, the game combines C# and vector math, so that's the main thing.

11
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:44.133
In this section we're going to be focusing primarily on the code and doing

12
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:48.133
the minimal possible in Unity; that will be for later sections, so

13
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.133
why are we doing that, Ben? Well, we just want you to be comfortable with what a lot of people, especially beginners,

14
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:56.133
find the hardest thing about Unity and programming and game development in general, which is

15
00:00:56.133 --> 00:01:00.133
the coding. So, we want you to put the hardest thing first to get it out of the way! Aren't we mean?

16
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:04.133
Mean? Mean, mean indeed! And so

17
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:08.133
I'm really looking forward to seeing you in this section and seeing the work you come up

18
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.900
with. So let's dive right in. See you there!
