Welcome to Vector Arithmetic!

2
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:13.966
In this video we have got some very exciting maths coming up for you! We're going to

3
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.966
understand what a vector is, or revise it for some of us, and we're

4
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:21.966
going to add and subtract vectors and figure out what that means. What does

5
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.966
adding one vector to another actually do? Then, we're going to use these

6
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.966
vectors to do something useful, to calculate the distance from home.

7
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.566
OK, let's get stuck in!

8
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:37.566
So, at the moment, our game is still a little bit boring, because

9
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:41.566
home is only ever left and right, it's never down or

10
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.566
up. So the way we are going to fix this is by

11
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:49.566
introducing a new concept, a concept called vectors!

12
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:53.566
Now, you may or may not remember vectors from highschool

13
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:57.566
maths but the idea is that a vector is basically

14
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.566
just a line with some direction, that's why it has an arrow, and a

15
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:05.566
length. It doesn't matter where the line starts, we can put it

16
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:09.566
anywhere in a system, in a grid system, it just has

17
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:13.566
a length and a direction. And because of that, we can represent

18
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:17.566
it, at least a 2 dimensional vector, we can represent with 2 numbers, hence

19
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:21.566
why 2 dimensions. So a two dimensional

20
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:25.566
vector is two numbers, but what do these numbers mean? Well the first number is

21
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:29.566
the amount that vector goes along in X, so

22
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:33.566
3 in this case, 3 units whatever the units are. And

23
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:37.566
in Unity we often use meters to be the unit. So we could say

24
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:41.566
3 meters, and then, it means it goes up 2

25
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.566
and up is Y. So it goes along 3 and up 2, so

26
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:49.566
our vector is (3, 2). OK so what about

27
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:53.566
adding vectors? What is adding a + b? So a

28
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:57.566
is this vector and b is this vector. Well actually, adding them

29
00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:01.566
is just following the path, so if we follow the path along a and

30
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:05.566
then along b, we get the vector a + b, which is this white

31
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:09.566
vector, like so. Then we have vector

32
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:13.566
subtraction, vector a - b. What does that mean?

33
00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:17.566
Well we have vector a, we follow that, that's going along

34
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:21.566
in the positive direction and then we subtract b. We go along

35
00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:25.566
in the negative direction, we follow the arrow backwards like

36
00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:29.566
this, and then, we get our

37
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.566
vector in white, a - b.

38
00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:37.866
So now that you're thoroughly bored to death with all of this maths, let's

39
00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:41.866
have a look at why it's applicable. We want to calculate the distance from home,

40
00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:45.866
if we have a player. So say our player is at this location. So

41
00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:49.866
interpreting a vector's location is quite easy. We assume that this is the

42
00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:53.866
0 point, the origin, the whatever you want to call it, this

43
00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:57.866
starting point for our reference system

44
00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:01.866
It's often 0, 0, and then, we have a

45
00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:05.866
Player which is at this location, at the end of the arrow, so the

46
00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:09.866
vector can give us a location in this way. So we have a Player who is

47
00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:13.866
lost somewhere here, at the end of the arrow, and then, we have another location,

48
00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:17.866
which is the location of Home, and that is at the end of this arrow.

49
00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:21.866
And we want to calculate the distance from the Player to Home.

50
00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:25.866
OK, but I'm not going to do that, I'm going to see what

51
00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:29.866
you've just learned. What should the distance be? I'd like you to

52
00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:33.866
use your knowledge of vector maths, the newly acquired knowledge

53
00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:37.866
for some of you. The hint is that you only

54
00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:41.866
need addition and subtraction, there's nothing, no other cleaver operations either.

55
00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:45.866
[Laughs] I've taught you everything you need to know about vectors.

56
00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:49.866
And then, share your thoughts in the discussions. I'd really like to see what some

57
00:03:49.866 --> 00:03:53.866
of you have just come up with by yourselves. OK, so pause the video and have a go

58
00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:57.866
and have a little head scratch. OK welcome

59
00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:01.866
back! I hope you've all been scratching your heads thoroughly! Let's have a look at what

60
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:05.866
is the actual correct answer. OK so the distance from home, you can

61
00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:09.866
think about it as we want to go from here to here, so

62
00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.866
that's like traveling along this arrow backwards and along this one

63
00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:17.866
forwards. So as I just clicked a little bit prematurely, that is this

64
00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:21.866
Distance here. So what we can say is that the Distance

65
00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:25.866
is equal to Home - Player, or - Player

66
00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:29.866
+ Home, exactly the same thing algebraically. So

67
00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:31.800
that is the answer!

68
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.266
Distance is = to Home - Player!

69
00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:39.266
Congratulations! Let's move on to the next lecture,

70
00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:42.066
where we'll actually be coding this into our game!
