00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,200
...

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Welcome! In this

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,200
lecture we are going to be covering. Well what is this

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,200
Unity interface all about? We're going to be looking at something called the Console,

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,200
what a scene is, which is this file here, and we're going to be creating our

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,200
first script in a language called C#. So let's dive right

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,200
in, but before I do that I just want to say, if you're an advanced programmer, you might find this section

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,200
a little bit slow. So if you do already know how to program,

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,200
skip on to the next section. You may want to even take that one at double speed, because that's bringing

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,200
us up to speed on Unity, and if you know some Unity, that might be a bit of repitition

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,200
for you, but revision's always good. So here we are doing some

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,200
beginner introductions to programming. Let's jump right in!

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,233
...

14
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:52,233
OK, so the first thing I want to do is go ahead and fire

15
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:56,233
up Unity. So I've got a shortcut here on the Desktop. You obviously

16
00:00:56,233 --> 00:01:00,233
know where you have installed it, so I'll leave that up to you. And the first

17
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:04,233
thing you'll notice is that I'm using Unity 5.3. Make sure you're using

18
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:08,233
5.3. I don't care what comes after the dot, that shouldn't really matter.

19
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:12,233
Now the first thing we're going to have to do is, there's a bunch of projects here, but they're not

20
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:16,233
ones we're going to be working on. We are going to be working on a new project, so we hit the New button,

21
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:20,233
funnily enough. Now you may be asked to log into Unity.

22
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:24,233
You may need to create an account in order to do that, so do just

23
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:28,233
go ahead and do that. Now, first thing's first, I'm going to select a new location

24
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:32,233
for this to be saved. So I'm going to go to Documents...

25
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:36,233
No I'm not, I'm going to go to Documents up here,

26
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:40,233
and then, I'm going to go into Courses, VR Course,

27
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:44,233
and obviously you stick it wherever you want to,

28
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:48,233
because I'm not going to force you to do anything. And then,

29
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,233
here I'm going to give the project a name. In this case, I'm going to call it 02, which is the

30
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:56,233
number of the section GoHome, because that is the name of the section, funnily enough.

31
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:00,233
OK, and I'm going to make this a 3D

32
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:04,233
asset and Create the Project. So

33
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:08,233
you've got options of 3D and 2D in Unity, but for this

34
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:12,233
whole course we are going to be sticking with 3D,

35
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:16,233
so just go ahead and do that. And bam, we have here the

36
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:20,233
Unity interface, and I want to take you on a quick whistle stop

37
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:24,233
tour through everything that is in here. So what does this

38
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:28,233
all mean? So the first thing, if you don't see something that looks like this, the first thing

39
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:32,233
we might want to do is do a quick reset of the layout. Because the

40
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:36,233
layout is completely customizable, what you can do is you can grab tabs, pull them out

41
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:40,233
so they float, or you can like drop them into other places. You

42
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:44,233
can split tabs and you can really generally make a whole mess, so I really

43
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:48,233
advise you to give this a go. Have a go at messing around and you can even

44
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:52,233
add more tabs from this Window menu. But once you've done that

45
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:56,233
messing around you want to know how to get back to normal, so the way we do that is, we click on this Layout menu

46
00:02:56,233 --> 00:03:00,233
at the top-right and then select the Default. And bang

47
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:04,233
we have our Default layout! So now everyone should be on the Default layout, no

48
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:08,233
matter what your previous state of having messed around with Unity has been.

49
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:12,233
So let me show you what there is in this Default layout, all the main

50
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,233
tabs and window areas. So let me draw your attention first off to

51
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:20,233
this top bar. This is quite useful, because it's obviously got the play button, which

52
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,233
now enables us to preview our game. There's not very much going on with our game,

53
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:28,233
at the moment, so that's a bit boring. We've also got some tools here, which we'll see

54
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:32,233
how they manipulate the Scene View a little bit later in our 3D sections, but

55
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:36,233
the Scene View is the principle of it, right here in the middle, which is our

56
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:40,233
3D scene, and you can move around it by right-clicking

57
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:44,233
or middle-clicking to pan around. But we won't be doing anything with

58
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:48,233
this in this section, because it's quite advanced to manipulate 3D objects. We are going to

59
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:52,233
be sticking with the Console. Now the Console is this little tab down here, and

60
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:56,233
it basically prints out text messages for us, so that's the

61
00:03:56,233 --> 00:04:00,233
Console down here. And we will be doing a little game in

62
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:04,233
text down here, to start off with, and get us introduced and comfortable with programming,

63
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:08,233
before we move on, in the next section, to use actual 3D objects

64
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:12,233
in the scene. Now, another important element of the Unity

65
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:16,233
Editor is the Hierarchy, that's this lovely thing over

66
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:20,233
here on the left, and the Hierarchy lists all the

67
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:24,233
objects in the scene and currently there aren't very many. There's a Directional Light and a Main

68
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:28,233
Camera, and we are going to be adding one, later on, in order to do

69
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:32,233
some of our game logic but we don't need that just yet.

70
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:36,233
So this is the Hierarchy, and you notice when I select things, things change

71
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:40,233
over here in the Inspector, and the Inspector gives us the various properties

72
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,233
of these objects. And obviously, when we're selecting things, you can obviously see where

73
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:48,233
they are in the scene. OK, so we have covered the scene, the

74
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:52,233
Console, the Hierarchy, the Inspector, and this top bar over

75
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:56,233
here. Now one last thing is the Project View! What is this Project View? Well

76
00:04:56,233 --> 00:05:00,233
it shows us all the files that our project consists of.

77
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,233
So there currently aren't any files this project consists of, and that's because we haven't

78
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:10,433
saved this scene. A scene is basically the building block of a Unity project,

79
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:14,433
essentially you would use them to do different levels, but basically, they capture

80
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:18,433
the state of this Hierarchy, the collection of objects in your

81
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:22,433
scene. So let's go ahead and create our first scene! The way we can do

82
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:26,433
this is by right-clicking in the project, going to Create,

83
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:30,433
and then, just heading on down to Scene

84
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:34,433
right here. Now I'll give our scene a name, I'm going to call it Main, and then,

85
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:38,433
let's make sure we have this scene open, because currently we have a scene named Untitled

86
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:42,433
opened and we can see that in the Title Bar. So double-click on Main,

87
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:46,433
and there you go, this is the Main scene! And it looks exactly the same, because the

88
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,433
Default scene in Unity always looks the same, it has a Main Camera and it has a Directional Light.

89
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,433
OK, so the subject of this lecture was not about

90
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:58,433
scenes, well not exclusively anyway. So what we're going to do, in this lecture is,

91
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:02,433
talk a little bit about scripts. What are scripts? Well scripts are very much like

92
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:06,433
scripts for an actor, ?in that they give you stage directions

93
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:10,433
or ways to manipulate the object in the scene

94
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:14,433
or just generally tell the computer steps to

95
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:18,433
do. So these steps could be like walk into the bathroom, turn on the

96
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:22,433
shower, stand under the shower, and take the soap. Now you have to

97
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:26,433
imagine though that this computer or this actor is very very dumb,

98
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:30,433
because it will follow these instructions to the letter. And what I mean

99
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:34,433
is, it will literally not even take off the clothes if it has to stand

100
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:38,433
under the shower, it has no conception of steps that you haven't

101
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:42,433
told it about, and even if there's like a punctuation error it will go completely

102
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:46,433
wrong and say I don't understand this, so it's very very pedantic

103
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:50,433
and we have to be very very careful about that. OK, so I've got

104
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:54,433
a little bit of a challenge for you, I'd like you to create a script

105
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:58,433
file. Now, you might be going, oh no I don't know how to

106
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:02,433
do that! Well let me tell you, it's very very simple. Use the Project pane, very

107
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:06,433
much like we created a scene, I'd like you to create a C#

108
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,433
script. What is C#? Well it's just one of the many languages the computer understands,

109
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:14,433
but you have to be consistent with which language you are choosing and C# is one of those

110
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,433
languages. And, in this case, it's a language which is built into

111
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:22,433
the Unity Game Engine. And I'd like you

112
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:26,433
to give it a sensible name, such as well... What are we going to be doing with

113
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:30,433
the script? We're going to be using it to print stuff to the Console, so give it a

114
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:34,433
name based on that! OK, so pause the video and have a go

115
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:38,433
at this little challenge!

116
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:42,433
OK welcome back! Here we are, I'm going to go and

117
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:46,433
create this script. So we can right-click, go to Create,

118
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,433
and I'm going to get this C# Script! Now I can rename this

119
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:54,433
script and I'm going to call it

120
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,433
ConsolePrinter.

121
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:02,433
It is a script responsible for printing to the Console.

122
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:06,433
Now what happens when we double-click this script, it's going to open in a program

123
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:10,433
called VisualStudio. So what is a script file, actually? Well a

124
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,433
script file really is just a text file, it just gives you

125
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:18,433
basically this text in here. And

126
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:22,433
this is the language that's understood by the computer and interpreted

127
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:26,433
to basically give the computer or, in this case, Unity some

128
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:30,433
instructions. So this VisualStudio, what is that?

129
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:34,433
Well basically, you could write just into text files, but VisualStudio

130
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:38,433
understands the language of it better and gives you hints and tips that just make you more productive,

131
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:42,433
and we'll see how that works in the next video. So congratulations

132
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:46,433
on creating your first script. In the next video, we are going to make it do

133
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,233
something! Let's see you there!
