00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Welcome to Vector for Position

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and Movement! In this video we are going to be understanding what on Earth a

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
vector is and how we can be using it for position and movement, as well as adding and subtracting

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and what that means in terms of position and basically finding

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
out where our character is and how they can find their way

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
home, and we're going to use vectors to calculate that path

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
home. So let's dive right in!

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So what we would really like to be able to do, at this point, is

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in the Update () method, to be able to update

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the location, from the Start () method. However, it's very hard to

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
be able to do this without understanding the thing that ties these two methods together

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and that is the class. Now to understand the class is a bit

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of work, it's hard for beginners, but don't worry,

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
we're going to take it slowly and we're going to build it up bit by bit. So in actual

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
fact, what I want to do is take us a little bit back. Rather than going to the

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Update location from home, because that requires us to understand

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the class, I want to explain classes by first taking

19
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
a revisit of these first three steps. So at the

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
moment, our location is a float, so that means

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
it's a one dimensional location, i.e. we can say

22
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that we are so many meters somewhere, right, in one direction.

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But let's say our game wants to be two dimensional, so

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we want to be able to say we are in some two dimensional space. Now,

25
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
how does that look? Well perhaps we are at the

26
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
X here, around here, and we've

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
got some reference point, some basically origin of our

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
two dimensional map, and that is this green point here. So

29
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
one way we can talk about this X point is by giving it coordinates.

30
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now what are coordinates? Well it's go along in basically

31
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the right direction by X = or

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
3 in this case and up by 2, and this gives us

33
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the coordinates of X. So you'll be familiar with this from math.

34
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now we've finally got the application for all of this, and this

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
is what we call a vector, and it's particularly a position

36
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
vector, because we're using it to define a position from the map

37
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
origin, which is this green point. And we use a arrow,

38
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
usually, to denote vectors, so it tells us that we need to

39
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
go a certain direction for a certain distance. So

40
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
there's two ways, basically, of giving a coordinate.

41
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Right, the first one is to give these two values,

42
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the longitude and latitude. The other way would be to say start from the origin,

43
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and then, take a so many degree heading and go for so many

44
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
meters. So that is what the vector is essentially doing, it's called direction

45
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and it's got an amount, a distance

46
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to go in that heading. So these are vectors and that's how

47
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
we navigate around by vectors. And what we would like

48
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to be able to say is, you know, be able to put together multiple

49
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
vectors, to basically denote a path. So we could say,

50
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
go in this heading for so many meters, and then, once you reach that

51
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
location, so that's the location at the end of this arrow, you can

52
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
go in a different heading for so many more meters. And that is

53
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
how we can add two vectors together, and the result is

54
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
if we had gone along this heading for so many meters.

55
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And you can see, it's very graphical how vectors

56
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
add together. So similarly, you can do

57
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
subtraction. So if we've got a vector A, which goes in this direction,

58
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and then, what we can do is, say from previously

59
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
you saw our vector B went in this direction, we can say negative

60
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
vector B, which basically says go in the same

61
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
direction but go backwards, rather than forwards. So if we went

62
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
forwards we'd end up down here somewhere, but because we went backwards, we end up up

63
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
here. And then, our resulting vector

64
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
can be basically found as A - B

65
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and it's up here. So this is what vectors are, they are

66
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
both a way of defining position but also as a way of

67
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
defining direction and movement. So vectors can represent both movement

68
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and position, at the same time. So they're position, when you think about

69
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
an origin and it's a way, essentially movement of getting to that point,

70
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and they're movement when we compose them together like this.

71
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So we want to find a path to home. Basically,

72
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
if our home and our location are both position

73
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
vectors. So we've got a Player and we've got Home

74
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and we've got some origin on the map. So our

75
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Home is not at the origin on the map, it's somewhere else and the Player is somewhere else, as well.

76
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
What we want to do is, find the path or the movement

77
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
that takes us from the Player's position to the Home location,

78
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and we can do this using addition and subtraction of vectors. So

79
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
what should that path be? That is the question!

80
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Use your knowledge of vector math! So we have just revised and perhaps for the first time

81
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
seen in these slides. Remember you can always find these slides by going to the lecture

82
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
resources and just taking a look over it. But don't look at the answer,

83
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
which will be in a followup slide. And hint, you only need to use addition and

84
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
subtraction, nothing more than that. So share your thoughts in the discussions,

85
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
regarding this, you know, maybe some diagrams you drew out, in order to help

86
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
you understand. OK, so pause the video here

87
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and have a go! Welcome

88
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
back! So I hope you've all had a go! It's really important to try these

89
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
challenges out. Even if you don't manage, not managing is just fine,

90
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
you can always come and watch the answers. But the important thing is that you try,

91
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
because then if you haven't tired you won't understand the solution as

92
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
well as someone who has tried, and it won't stick in your brain as well. So that is why we do

93
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
these challenges. So this is the answer! If I want to go

94
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the distance from home, I need to go along the minus

95
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Player direction. So we need to go backwards along that Player direction and then

96
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
forwards along the Home direction, and you can see how these two vectors

97
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
give us this path here, that I was showing you before.

98
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So this Distance from Home or this path to Home is what ends up

99
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
being given. So this was a short lecture showing you an introduction, a recap

100
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
to vectors and how they are applicable to our location and our

101
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
homeLocation. So we are now in the next video

102
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
going to show you how we can store more complex things in

103
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
variables, rather than just floats and strings! We're going to show you how you can store things like

104
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.933
vectors! So I'll see you there!
