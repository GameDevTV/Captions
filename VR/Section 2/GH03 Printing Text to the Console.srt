00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be looking at what

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,800
is going on in this Unity Editor, it would seem quite confusing

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,800
to somebody just looking at it for the first time. And we're also going to be using

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,800
this thing called the Console and being able to print

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,800
these messages using code, so we're going to actually start programming in

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,100
this lecture.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,100
So the first thing we need to do is create a new

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,100
Unity project, so I'm going to fire up the Unity Editor.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,100
And we want to create a New

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Project, call it GoHome,

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,100
and you can put this in any location that makes sense for

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,100
you, and it doesn't matter whether it's 3D or 2D at this stage but we'll

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,100
keep it on 3D which is the default. So let's create that project

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,100
and see what Unity creates for us. It will

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,100
do a little bit of generating and different things, and when it's finished with that it

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,100
will pop up and look something like this. So

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,100
you can resize these different panes, as you can see I'm doing

18
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,100
here, just to give a different amount of space. And

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,100
very roughly what we have here is the 3D Viewport

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,100
in the middle, a Hierarchy to the left, which tells us what

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,100
objects are in this 3D view. We have an Inspector to

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,100
the right, we won't worry about what that is, and we have a couple of tabs down

23
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,100
here. We have a Project pane and a Console pane.

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,100
Now the one we're interested in is the Console, so let's click on the Console tab

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,100
and have a look at what we've got here. OK, so there's some

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,100
buttons here for clearing and doing other things with this Console,

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,100
but until there's some text on the Console, it's not very obvious what

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,100
this is actually for. So I'm going to leave that

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,100
for now, and we're going to have a look in the Hierarchy and in

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,100
our Project pane. So our Project pane is where all the files are stored,

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,100
and we need to start off by creating what Unity calls a scene. A

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,100
scene is a collection of these objects at the top here, and it

33
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,100
basically describes something like a level in our game, and in our case

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,100
we only have one level. So I'm going to right click in the Project pane,

35
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,100
in the Assets folder, so you can see here I've got the

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Assets folder selected on the left and that's why I'm right clicking in the

37
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,100
right. Then, I go to Create and then I select Scene

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,100
down here. So I create a scene, and this scene is going to be

39
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,100
called Main. So you can see, I can create the scene and rename it instantly.

40
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Now, if I double-click that, I can see,

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,100
up in the top window here, that I've created a scene called

42
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,100
Main.unity. That's what I'm editing at the moment. So the Unity Editor

43
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,100
only edits one scene at a time, and that is important to remember.

44
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,100
Now, in the Hierarchy we have a list of objects. We have a Camera and a

45
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,100
Directional Light, but none of this is actually what we want, so I'm just going to right click

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,100
both of these and just delete them. And we're going to want to introduce a

47
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,100
new object. So to do that, you've got two objects, you can right click the...

48
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,100
You can click on the Game Object menu at the top of the page, or you can right click

49
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,100
in the Hierarchy, go down to Create Empty. We want to

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,100
start with an empty object. And I'm just going to call this game

51
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,100
object, if you go over to the right there is the Inspector,

52
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,100
and at the top of the Inspector is the name, so you can just change its name. I'm

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,100
going to call it GoHomeGame, and

54
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,100
then just hit Enter to apply that rename. Now,

55
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,100
the reason we have to create a new object in our Hierarchy is that Unity can't

56
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,100
run scripts unless they're attached to a game, and we want

57
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,100
to create a script, we want to start programming. So how do we

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,100
create that first script of ours? Well again, in the Assets folder,

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,100
you can right click, and we're going to create a new Asset, which this time is going to

60
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,100
be a C# script. So let's right click, Create,

61
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,100
C# Script, that's the one I have selected here.

62
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,100
And I'm going to also call this one GoHomeGame.

63
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Now, as I said, we need to attach

64
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,100
a script to a game object. How do we do that? Very simply,

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,100
we select the script in the Assets folder and we drag it

66
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,100
onto the game object in the Hierarchy, like so.

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,100
Now I can check that that's worked by selecting the game object in the Hierarchy

68
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,100
and then having a look in the Inspector. The Inspector tells us various properties about the

69
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,100
game object. We don't need to worry about Transform, but the important one is

70
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,100
below Transform, where it says Go Home (Script), Go Home Game

71
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,100
(Script). That tells us that the script has been attached to the game object and it

72
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,100
will be run, when we run our game. OK, so there's a

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,100
script here, but what does it contain? If we double click it,

74
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,100
on Windows this will open up in VisualStudio, on Mac it will open up

75
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,100
in MonoDevelop. And it's pretty much the same,

76
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,100
there will be some differences between the UI, but

77
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,100
you should be able to follow along in both cases.

78
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,100
OK, so this is VisualStudio and it's basically just for

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,100
editing our code. And what is our code? Well it is

80
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,100
things like this. We don't have to worry about what all of this

81
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,100
means right now, we are just going to be adding some code

82
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,100
into this bit underneath Start (), between these two brackets here.

83
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,100
You see these curly braces? We're going to be adding code only between these two

84
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,100
braces, for now. Now the code I want to add

85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,100
is the following. I'll hit Tab,

86
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,100
so that makes this indented like so, and

87
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,100
I'm going to write code print, brackets,

88
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,100
and then, I'm going to print a message ("Hello world"),

89
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,100
because I'm traditional and that's what we always like to print in our first programs.

90
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Now you can see there's a little red squiggly line, and if I hover

91
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,100
over it, it says that it expects a semicolon. OK,

92
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,100
so I will write that and then, I'll just save my file command

93
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,100
or Control S, depending which platform you're on. So there's no

94
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,100
red squiggly line, so there's nothing misspelled nothing wrong in terms of

95
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,100
the code here. Now what was it that we have just written here? It's a

96
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,100
bit interesting, we have written what is called a print statement

97
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,100
or a call to a print function. It's

98
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,100
very much like a function you'd have in math, like sign or co-sign,

99
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,100
but this function has the effect of writing stuff to the Console.

100
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,100
So that is the name of the function

101
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,100
print, and then, in brackets is what

102
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,100
we'd call the argument to our function, so it is the

103
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,100
thing that we want to print. And because it's text, we have to put

104
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,100
quotes around it, so the program can tell the difference between text and just

105
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,100
other parts of the program, the other names in the program like print,

106
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,100
for example. And then, in C# everything,

107
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,100
every line, has to end with a semicolon, which is why it was complaining earlier.

108
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,100
So that's what we have here. Now if we go back over

109
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,100
to Unity and if we hit our Play Button...

110
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,100
And we need to make sure it's not maximizing on

111
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,100
play, so I'm going to stop it again by hitting the Play Button again.

112
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Now, if we hit play, it shouldn't maximize. That's

113
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,100
correct, it says the "Scene is missing a fullscreen camera". That is fine because we're only interested in the

114
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,100
output in the Console, so if we click on the Console there we go,

115
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,000
we have our message that we printed from our script!

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So it's time for a quick challenge! I'd like you to write your own print

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
statement. I'd like you to introduce the user to the game, some text

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
basically saying, hello welcome to our game!

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And then, I would like you to try something a little bit more difficult, which is how do you write

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
multiple lines into the Console? See if you can figure that out from what I've

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
told you, so far, and then, share a screenshot in the discussions,

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that tells you basically, shows everyone

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
what you've been able to do, what you've been able to print out. Don't worry about sharing

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
something or a question, that's fine, that's what the discussions are there for.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So pause the video, go have a go at this!

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
OK

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
welcome back! I hope you've all managed to have a go! It doesn't matter if you've got it right,

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,166
we will be going through the solution right now.

129
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:39,166
So the first part of the challenge was to print a

130
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:43,166
welcome message. So I'm going to say

131
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:47,166
("Welcome,

132
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:51,166
something like that!

133
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:55,166
("Welcome to Go Home!"). And then, we want to print a second line, so

134
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,166
what we're going to do is copy this entire line and

135
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:03,166
add a new line, using the Return key, and printing

136
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:07,166
adding a second print, inside Start (). So print

137
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:11,166
and then, I'll put some different text on this line,

138
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:15,166
saying something along the lines of...

139
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:19,166
[Typing Sounds]

140
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:23,166
("A game

141
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:27,166
where you need to find your way home."). That sounds about right, I'm going to delete this

142
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,166
extra line, just for prettiness. And you'll notice it's

143
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:35,166
very similar, we've got two prints, and hopefully, that will

144
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,166
create two lines for us. So we have to pause the game, stop the game, in

145
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,166
fact,using,  by hitting the Play Button, and then, hit the play again

146
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:47,166
to start the game again. And as you can see, now we've have two lines. We've got "Welcome to

147
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:51,166
Go Home" and "A game where you need to find your way home".

148
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:55,166
Perfect, challenge completed! I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture!
