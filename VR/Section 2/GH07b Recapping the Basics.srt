Hey guys, congratulations on completing your first quiz!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, these first few concepts of programming are pretty hard to grasp, so don't worry,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but it is important that we get a good foundation.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And so if you've struggled with anything and anything's been tricky in the quiz, do go back and review the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
videos linked from the quiz, they'll really help you get a good foundation to

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
move forward. So what have we covered? So far, we have done the Game Design Document,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so we know what game we're building. We have also designed using

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
pseudocode, to help us and give us an idea of what code we need to write,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
even though we don't know quite how to write it yet. We've also seen how to use a

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
computer as a calculator, how to get it to print things, and we know that, really, it's just a dumb actor,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
so we give it very very basic instructions. So if, at any point, you

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
are struggling with the instructions you're giving and it's just not obeying and you're not sure why,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
then do use the lecture resources, because there we've got a link to Git

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hub, which shows you all the code that we have written. And you can

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
compare it side by side and see whether there's any mistakes in how you have written it, and that's

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
quite common, at this point. So, with that said, let's dive right in to the next

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,666
videos!
