00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome! In this video

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we are going to be creating a rough plan for this game, coming up, this

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
game that we're going to call Go Home, and we'll going to dig into the details of

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
obviously, later on in this lecture. So, we'll

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
start off by defining the user's problem. The reason for this is, we really want to get in

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the user's head when we're designing a game. We want to know what makes them tick? Why are we creating this

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
game? What problem are we solving for them? Then, we go

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
on to brain storm the core of the Game Design Document, the concept, rules, and

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
requirements. We'll get into details of what each of these is in a little

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
bit. And then, we're going to document possible future ideas, because we

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
don't want to have the scope creep too far on us, we want to know what

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
things we're going to do in the future, but not now, so it's a no list.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, let's start off with the problem.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A user might be bored. So, this is a very common

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
problem that games solve, they solve boredom, or they

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I might want to challenge myself. You want to get better, you want

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to constantly improve and see how

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
far you can get in a game. Or you might want to beat your friends, you might

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
want to play against your friends and see who can get the best score. So, that's the reason that we have

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
scores in games, is we want to beat our friends.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How about the concept? So, this game is called Go Home,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and basically, you are lost and trying to find your way home.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All you know is your distance from home, so your completely

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
blind in a world presumably completely mired by fog, but somehow,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
you've got a beacon that is telling you, you are so many meters away from home

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and you've got to find your way back to home, using this

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
beacon device. Now, how does that work?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What are the rules? Well you can move up, down, left, and right, those

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
are your interactions with the game. And your movement is a,

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
by a fixed distance, so you can hop say 1 meter up or

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
1 meter down or 1 meter left or 1 meter right. And then, after

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
each turn your distance from home is displayed. We're going to be using something called a console

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but you'll see that in a minute. And when you win,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you win when you get home, obvious, the name of the game!

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And the score is how many turns it took you to get

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
home. So, that's the competitive element, that's the bit that allows you to compete with your friends. You can

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
say, look I'm able to do it in so many fewer turns than you!

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm much better! ect. And so, it's fulfilled somebodies need for

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
competition! Now, this is a

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
challenge slide. This you can see from the pause button and the

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
green. Basically it means that I want you to soon pause the video and

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
have a go at something yourself. So, I want you to have a

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
go at writing the requirements. Now, let me give you an inkling of what this actually

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
means. What kind of assets will we need? And so we're talking about

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
requirements. When we build this game, what are we going to need to have that we can't

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
produce ourselves. So for example, do we need any 3D assets, 2D assets,

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
anything like that? Do we need any sound effects? Will our

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
game require some sound effects? Do we need some artwork to make

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the game look pretty, perhaps some level load screens, things like that?

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And what featurs will you be leaving out? What will you

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
need for a future version of the game or just include them at all, as your no

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
list. So I konw you have never done this before and it might be a bit new

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and novel but it doesn't matter. You don't have to worry about getting it wrong, there is no

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
right answer. I'd just like you to brainstorm your requirements and

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
brainstorm your no list, and then, share those

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
requirements in the discussions. So do that, pause the video, and share in the

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
discussions before coming back and continuing with the video.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
OK welcome back! I hope you've all paused and had

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
a go! It's really important to have a go, even if you're not completely sure it will

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
really help, when you do go and look through at the solution to actually

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
have understood it. You know, I've tried it and yes that makes sense, it really helps

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
your learning a lot more. So what requirements

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
have I come up with? I'm keeping the scope very minimal and it's just going to be a

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
text based game, so the requirements for me are going to be an introduction

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and story text. That is pretty much most of it. We

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
might need some ASCII artwork to make our

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
story look a little bit more pretty and less

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
left brained, and then, we might want some sounds.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, but in this case, I think we'll leave them out seeing it's a text based game,

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
so we'll say no sound effects for this game.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How about the future ideas, things that we won't implement right now? I'm not

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
going to be implementing a graphical interface, we'll leave that for future sections and we'll do things like

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that then. And again, no sound effects. So that

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is everything for this lecture. In the next lecture, we are going

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
to be getting started and having a go at

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,133
programming our first program.
