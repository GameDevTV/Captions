2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Welcome! I this video, Writing to the Console,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
what are we going to do? Well we're going to learn how to write, funnily

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
enough, to this area here, which is called the Console, and we're going to

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
do that by learning a little bit about the anatomy of these program lines

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and what it is that makes them tick. What is it that

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
hooks them up to the actors in Unity and

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
makes them print to the Console? So that's very exciting stuff, it's going to be your first program

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
ever, for some of you, so let's dive right in!

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So we saw this file briefly at the end of the last video. All I've done since is

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
clean up by closing a few of these tabs around the edges, to give us more

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
space to look at this lovely file. And I'd

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
like to draw your attention to a couple of bits. Well, first off, it

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is quite complicated, so we're not going to chew all of this at once, we're

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
going to tackle it one bit at a time. And the bit I want to draw your attention to

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is where it says Start () and this whole block here, from

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this curly brace to the end curly brace. This is where we're going to put our code

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to run once at the startup. So this tells the

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
actor that, when we start we want to do the following, very very

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
simple. So what do we want to do? Well we want to print, so what I'm going to

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
do is create a print command in

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
here between these two curly braces. A print command looks just like this, it's print.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then, the question is, what do I print? So we have to tell it what to print

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and that goes between curly brackets like this...

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Not curly brackets, sorry, round brackets like this. And then,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
what we want to print is some text, and in

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Unity speak, in fact in programming speak full stop, text is known as a

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
string. So I'm going to be calling it a string from now on, but

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you may want to think of it as text

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and text has to go between these two

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
double quotes. So what we can say is, "Hello

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
World!"), and I'm going to put an exclamation mark at

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the end of that. And, as you see,

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
it's very important that the brackets and the quotes are correct, because, like I said,

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
this actor is very stupid, and if you do anything like

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
getting these order wrong, like this, he won't be able to understand it,

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
so we need to make sure that the quotes are inside the brackets.

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And then, one more thing, you'll notice that the IDE is

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
already pointing out a little error for us with this red squiggly line, it's like

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
spelling correction but for your code, and for the stupid actor, it's

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
telling us what the stupid actor won't be able to understand. And in this case, it's saying it

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
expected a semicolon. So why did it need a semicolon? Well that's because

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the actor needs to know when he's finished doing this particular instruction and

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
when he should move on to do the next one. So let's run through the anatomy one more

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
time! We have a command to the actor, which is print. We then

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
have brackets, which tell us that we're about to give some

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
information about what to print. Then, we have

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a quote, which tells us that the thing we're about to print is a string, also

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
known as text, and then, inside we have the text,

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
then we say we're finished with the string, and then, we say we're finished

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
with the things that we want to print and then we say we're

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
finished with this whole command, this whole action. So

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that is how the actor is going to go about reading and

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
executing this action, and the whole thing is within these Start ()

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
curly brackets, which means... Whoops, I don't want to do that.

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The whole thing is within the Start () with curly brackets, which means that

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it is done when the game starts. So I'm going to save this

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
file. And then, how do we get it to run? Well we need

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
an actor to run our script, so let me talk a little bit about that.

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So we've got scripts, and in Unity speak, these are known as

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Components. I'll get you used to that terminology early on, because we'll be using it

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
throughout the course. And then, we have our stupid actor,

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which in Unity speak is known as a Game Object, and

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it's obviously a Game Object, because it is an object in the game and the Components

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
are parts of its behavior. In fact, I say parts because you could

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
have multiple scripts or multiple components,

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
each of which is a different part of that particular actor's behavior, and we'll

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
see that in later sections but, in this section, we won't need it just yet.

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So what do we understand from that? Well we need

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
our scripts to be attached to an actor or

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
GameObject, so our script which is a Component needs to be attached

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to a GameObject. Now the GameObjects all live in

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
the Hierarchy or in the scene, so we need to right-click

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
in the Hierarchy to create a new GameObject and go down to Create

75
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Empty. Now I can rename this GameObject by going over to the

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Inspector and changing where it says this default name of GameObject.

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I'm going to change this to ConsolePrinter

78
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and GO for GameObject, for short. Now remember you have

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
to hit Enter, in order to rename this, I always fall [Laughs] for that one, and then,

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
we need to attach a script. How do we do that? Well quite simple, we can either

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
drag onto the object in the Hierarchy or we drag onto

82
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the object in the Inspector. Either one will do the same thing, it will just list

83
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the script or Component in our Inspector.

84
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So there we go, we know that the ConsolePrinter script has now been

85
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
attached to our ConsolePrinter GameObject!

86
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So we can save our scene by Control saving, and hit

87
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
play. Now you'll notice, if we go over to the Console, that

88
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
we've got a "Hello World!" printed! Excellent! Now

89
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
just to show you that this script indeed needed to be attached to the GameObject, we can

90
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
remove it again. So we click on the cog, hit Remove

91
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Component, and then, hit play.

92
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Go over to the Console and notice nothing is being printed. So

93
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
congratulations, we have printed our first line

94
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
out of a script. Now what I want to show you is a

95
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
very common error that people often make. When you right-click and

96
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Create and create a C# Script, it will create a new behavior with this default name.

97
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Now if you don't rename, at this point, say you click away, for example, then you come back

98
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
to rename what will happen is something very interesting.

99
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I'm going to rename this to Test

100
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Script. And if I wanted to

101
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
attach this to our ConsolePrinter GameObject or our Console Printer actor

102
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I can do that by dragging, but you'll notice that Unity gives us an error

103
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and the error actually gives us a clue as to what's going on. Have a little think, what do you

104
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
think it could be? OK, you may not have got it

105
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
but I will tell you. It is actually...

106
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And ignore that. It's actually that

107
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
this class has to be the same as

108
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
this .cs script. Oops, I opened in chrome

109
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
by accident. Let's open that test script.

110
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So you'll notice that TestScript.cs

111
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
is not the same as NewBehaviorScript. You'll notice that this comes

112
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
after class, that's how you know what I'm talking about. So what we need to do is

113
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
also rename this to match. We can save that file,

114
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
go over to Unity, drag it onto the ConsolePrinterGO,

115
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and click on the GO Object, and we'll see that,

116
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
there you go, indeed that component has been added on to the GameObject.

117
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So let's Remove it, because we don't want that. We can delete it with right-

118
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
click, Delete, and

119
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
move our Console... Oops, I don't want to move the whole tab!

120
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I want to move this Console script onto the Game

121
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
ConsolePrinterGO and play again to check

122
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that everything's still as it should be. Yep, my Console is still printing

123
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
"Hello World!". So that's a little primer

124
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
on GameObjects and Components and how they relate to each other. And in actual

125
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
fact, they're just fancy words for Actors and Scripts, so you can think of it in that way,

126
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
too. We also have just looked at how we can look at the

127
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
ConsolePrinter to print this ("Hello World"). So that is

128
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
all fabulous! Now it's time for

129
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
a challenge! I'd like you to write a game intro to our Go Home

130
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
game. I'd like you to print your own print statement. And can you

131
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
write multiple lines? How would you give multiple instructions to

132
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
your actor? And then, share a screenshot, both of the code

133
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and of this little bit, the

134
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Console, in the discussions. OK, so

135
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
pause the video and test out your knowledge.

136
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
OK welcome back!

137
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So you have presumably had a go at this. Now

138
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
you may have guessed it but the way of printing two lines is

139
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
simply like so, but

140
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
this is not very neat. We often, in programming, have

141
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
lots of conventions which aren't strictly necessary, such as, you notice that when I

142
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
added the semicolon, this print line automatically had

143
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
these tabs inserted before it. But it would equally

144
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
well just work if all of these white spaces were removed and it just

145
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
looked like this, but it's really ugly and really hard for humans to read,

146
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
not the actors, not the stupid actors, they just go and read character by character

147
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
but us humans, we would struggle with this. So what we often

148
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
do is we make sure that each command, each statement,

149
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is written on its own line, like so.

150
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And I don't forget my semicolon, on the end of the line, and go over to

151
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Unity and let's hit play! There we go, we've got

152
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
"Hello World!" and "Hello2"! Brilliant!

153
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So how do we introduce people

154
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
to the game? Well let's say

155
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
("Welcome to Go Home!"), and then, on the second

156
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
line we can say ("A game

157
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
where you need to find your way back.")

158
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
like so. Let's just test that out!

159
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
We'll get used to this cycle of writing code and going back

160
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
into Unity and hitting play and watching our changes. Here we go!

161
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
"Welcome to Go Home!" "A game where you need to find your way back."

162
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So how do we take a screenshot of this?

163
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
We take our Snipping Tool on Windows, on Mac it's

164
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
slightly different. We can create a New Snip and

165
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
then just select the bit of the screen that's relevant, like so.

166
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And then, you can save this file to your Desktop or wherever and

167
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
follow the discussions link for this lecture, and either create a new topic

168
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
or just add in to the sharing post that is already there, where lots of people have been

169
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
sharing their first experiences of writing to the Console. And go and

170
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
congratulate other students, get involved and really share in the

171
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
joy of your achievements. Congratulations, pat yourselves on the back! When you are

172
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
happy with this, continue on to the next video! See you there!

173
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.300
