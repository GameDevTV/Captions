1
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,633
In this lecture, we are going to be looking at how you can respond to

2
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:15,633
key presses. Here I'm pressing down arrow keys and getting different log messages

3
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:19,633
coming up. We're also going to be looking at what on Earth this

4
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:23,633
Update () thing was about anyway, and we're going to be learning about

5
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:27,633
searching for the documentation, so that you can help yourselves.

6
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:28,800
Let's get stuck right in!

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
So this game is a little bit dull because the user really doesn't have

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
any way to interact with it. So what we want to be able to achieve

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
is that when we hold down an Arrow key, it essentially

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
moves our player around this invisible world.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
So how do we do that? How do we get hold of user input in

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Unity? Well I'm going to teach you to teach yourselves. I think we need

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
to go about Googling this, so let's do "get

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,800
keyboard input unity".

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,800
A search like that should start to bring up

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,800
the right sort of results, that's the kind of thing that we want. And if you look

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
here, you can read around a little bit, but I'm going to

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,800
jump straight to it. The one we want is Input.GetKeyDown, this thing here.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
So I'm just going to open that up, and

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
the place to look is in the examples. OK, so

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,800
you can see that they have some code very similar to ours, and there's

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,800
even an Update (). We have an Update (), if you've seen here,

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
we've got an Update (), too. So, and in their Update (), what they're

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
doing is the following. OK, so

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,800
this gives us a baseline. This is another one in fact and,

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
in fact, I like this one more and I'll explain later why later on,

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
but for now, let's just go with this. Let's take this example,

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm going to copy it, and I'm going to paste it,

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,800
just like they have, in the Update () method. Now

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
I've just called this an Update () method, I've not called it that before. So these

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
two things are called methods and they are,

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
they got names and they have curly braces, and the things inside them are what run

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
when the method is called. That's what we're seeing in this

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,800
bit here, it says "// Update is called once per frame".

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
And what it means by called is, that this code

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
runs once per frame, whereas here, this is used for initialization.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
This is the Start () method, it's only run once at the beginning.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
That's why we're only seeing these messages come out once.

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
But we want to check whether the key is down every frame,

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
so that's why it has to go in the Update () method, otherwise we'd only check

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
the first time, and we'd only print anything if the Spacebar

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
was down at the very start of the game but never after that,

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
so that's why we want to do it like this.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Now we don't want to do it on Space, we want to do an Arrow key, so we

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
want to do the Down Arrow. And you can see it's completing for me.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I want DownArrow, that's that one there, with capitals letters like

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
so. So if I save that and go

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
ahead and hit play again,

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
and have a look in the Console,

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
we'll see that there is nothing played. But I hit the DownArrow

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
...

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
...and we see that the "space key was pressed". OK,

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
so the message is wrong but the behavior is correct. When I hit

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
the Arrow key we get a new message, which is exactly what we're looking for.

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
So one more point to note, now I don't particularly

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
like how they have done this in their example. It's a little bit naughty, we'll explain

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
why later, but what you want to do is put braces around,

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
like you see here. So I've got if brace print

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
closed brace like this, and they're the curly sort, the ones

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
that you'll see above the square brackets,

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
just underneath the plus and minus signs on a standard keyboard,

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
a US or English keyboard, you'll find it there. So that's

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
what we want to end up with. And you can just take this as

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
wrote for now that, that is what we want, and

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
we can do that same thing for other keys, too. So I'm going to say

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
"down arrow was pressed"

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
like so, and we can do other keys, as I say.

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Let me undo that, I did that wrong. So I'm just going to select these lines,

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
copy, and create a new line and paste it on

70
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
there. And so we can do an UpArrow as well.

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Just to Up and UpArrow here,

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
too. Now, let's see whether Unity can tell the difference.

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
We're going to hit play!

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
"up arrow was pressed", "down arrow was pressed". Up arrow, down arrow,

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,400
and you can't see my keyboard but this is corresponding to exactly what I'm

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,400
pressing. And you can try it for yourself to see and make sure that I'm not lying.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,200
So I have a challenge for you! I would like you to handle

78
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,200
the other keys, that means the Left and Right keys.

79
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Use the code that you have already written, that's the hint you know. You've already

80
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,200
seen some pattern of how this works, and I'd like you to use that

81
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,200
pattern and try and adapt it to handle Left and Right Arrow keys.

82
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Add new cases for the Left and Right Arrows. So that's what

83
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I mean by handling the other keys. OK, so pause the video and have a go

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,200
at that now. OK welcome back!

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,200
I hope you have managed to have a go! I'm going to dive right in and show you how it works!

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
So this one is fairly easy if you have managed to spot the

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
pattern. All we have to do is copy this bit of code

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
and do it again. And we're going to do it twice, because we're going

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
to have two different keys. We're going to have the Left Arrow Key, so I'm going to replace Left Up Arrow

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
with LeftArrow, and I'm going to replace this UpArrow

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
with RightArrow. And then, I am

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
going to change it in the text too, left and right

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
like so. OK,

94
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
now if we go and play, we should be able to see

95
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
it all working accordingly and printing back the keys that we've pressed.

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Left arrow, right arrow, up arrow, down arrow, etc.

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
And you can see, that is working exactly as I am pressing the keys,

98
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
and you'll have to try it yourself to check that I'm not lying. OK, so in the

99
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
next video, we are going to be getting a little bit more advanced with these things, the

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,500
if statements. So I look forward to seeing you there!
