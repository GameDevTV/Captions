Welcome

2
00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:05.833
and well done for completing this section! You're

3
00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:09.833
finally coders!! [Laughs] Absolutely! So how did it feel? How did it feel?

4
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:13.833
Why don't you share in the discussions, especially if you're a beginner, how you feel having gone

5
00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:17.833
from doing no coding to actually getting your hands a little bit dirty, we'd be really interested

6
00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.833
to find out. What have they actually learned, Sam? So, in this section, you have learned

7
00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:25.833
the basics of C#, the industry standard programming language,

8
00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.833
so well done, that is fantastic news! Yeah absolutely! You also learned a bit about

9
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.833
vector math! You know how to add these little guys together now, and that's going to come in super

10
00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.833
handy in the rest of the course for you. It is. So why don't you just start

11
00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:41.833
the next section straight away, to keep up the momentum! Absolutely! That is very very

12
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.266
useful, so dive right in!
