00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:10,866
Welcome! In this video we are going to be looking at

2
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:14,866
how the Unity Editor, that is every thing here, works. And how

3
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:18,866
can we move, how can we rotate

4
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:22,866
objects in the scene, and how can we, importantly,

5
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:26,866
scale objects in the scene, as well? Basically, how do we manipulate 3D objects

6
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:30,866
in the scene? And finally, how do we preview our scene?

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,533
So that's what I want to cover in this lecture! Let's get stuck right in!

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,800
OK, so the first thing we want to do is open up

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
the Unity Editor. And what we're going to do,

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
first of all, is create a new Unity project. So

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,800
with that we do New, and we are going to be

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
saving it anywhere. And we're going to call this

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
ShootHoop and that should do.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
OK, and I'm gong to select this as a 3D project.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,800
That's what we want to do, we're delving straight into 3D in this section. So let's

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Create that Project!

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Now what we expect is a few things to be set up for us but not very

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
much, and we'll be presented with this Editor view, which we'll have seen

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,800
before but now we're going to delve into a little bit more detail. OK,

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,800
so the first thing to note is the Hierarchy in the left

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,800
towards the top. There's a tab called Hierarchy and underneath it there is this

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,800
list of items. The Main Camera, so

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,800
you can see, when I select this, there's things going on in this Preview view

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,800
here, and if I select the Directional Light, that shows a different

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,800
object selected in this 3D viewport. So the Hierarchy

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,800
is all the list of objects that are here in the scene. Now

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,800
what is a scene? A scene is the file, essentially, that we're

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,800
editing, but more specifically, in a game, a scene could be a

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,800
level, for example, or it could be a splash screen or it could be a game

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
over screen. But essentially it is a different collection of

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,800
these game objects, as they're called, like Main Camera and

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Directional Light. So how do we create

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
one of these scenes? At the moment, we don't start with one by default.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
If you go down to the bottom-left-most section, so

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
the Project Pane, you'll see there is a list of

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
folders. You want to select the Assets folder, and then, in the right

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,800
section, this is the contents of the Assets folder and it says "This folder is

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
empty". You want to right-click and go to Create

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
and then scene. So that's right-click, Create, Scene,

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
and this creates us a new scene file.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Now we can give this a name, I'm going to call this the Main scene,

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
and we can hit Save.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
It has already saved for us, this is giving me the option to...where to save it,

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
but let's just check that out. So what files has this created

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
for us? I'm going to go into my Documents, ShootHoop,

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
and then into the Assets folder. And in the Assets folder you see

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
we have this Unity...this main file, and then, we have a META

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
file as well, that's not as important. The main thing is this

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Unity Main file, and if you double-click it, it actually opens up Unity

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
with this scene selected. OK, so that is what

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,800
a scene is. It is a collection of items, of game objects in

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Hierarchy. Now how do we add game objects and

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
what's it actually do? Well let's start by this..looking at the middle here at these+

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,800
play/pause buttons. OK, so if I hit play, what

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I get is a preview of my game. At the moment it's very boring, all I've got is a Skybox and a

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,800
camera, so all I see is the sky. So I'm going to

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,800
hit play again to stop the game. Let's make this a little bit

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
more interesting. If we right-click in the Hierarchy, we have the option to create objects.

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,800
So if I go down to 3D Object and select Cube, I can

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,800
put a cube into our scene. If I hit play now,

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,800
we can see it's a bit vague, because

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
the color blends in with the background but we have a cube there.

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,800
And if I select one of these arrows

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,800
on the cube, when the cube is selected, so make sure you select the cube in the Hierarchy,

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
and then, go onto the arrow. We can move it up and down

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
or backwards and forwards. Select the cube again,

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
go backwards and forwards, you can also select items by clicking on them in the viewport,

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
or left and right. And now if I hit play,

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
you will see that that cube has been moved higher up and it's much more visible now.

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
There are a few more things that we can do to edit things in the

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
scene. The first thing to note is, how do we navigate

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
around this scene? So you can use the scroll wheel, that allows you to zoom in

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
and out. If you double-click an item in the Hierarchy, it will

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
put it into focus,

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
and if you hold down Alt

76
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
while dragging, you'll be able to rotate around whatever it

77
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
is you are focusing on. I can zoom out, rotate,

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
etc. Now there's a few

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
more controls to note. Up here in the

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
top-left we have a toolbar of sorts. We

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
have a Hand tool, which allows us to drag our viewport

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
like so. It's not dragging the item, it's actually dragging the whole viewport, so basically

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
where our viewport camera is. We have the Movement, which we have seen.

84
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
We have Rotation, which we haven't seen. It allows us to rotate

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
objects like so, by dragging their different handles. If we

86
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
play, we can see what the result of that rotation has been. We now have that offset

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
cube. We also have Scaling, so I can

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
make one edge of the cube bigger, like so. I  hit play, I can see the preview.

89
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Yep, we now have not a cube at all but more of an oblong

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,800
box. And this final element is for editing UI's,

91
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
so we won't worry about that too much. But one thing to note is that all of these can be

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
accessed by using your Q, W, E, R, and T

93
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
keys. they essentially align with the tools in this way. So if I hit

94
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Q i get that, if I hit W I get that, if I hit E

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I get Rotation, if I hit R then I get Scale.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
So they're not mnemonic, they're basically just locations on your keyboard.

97
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,700
So it's time for your first 3D challenge!

98
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,700
I would like you to create a floor for the gym, using the

99
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,700
knowledge that we have just accumulated, by.. in this video. So

100
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,700
start by adding a cube to the scene, then use the Scale

101
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Tool to make it large. So make it wide and

102
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,700
long, but it doesn't need to be high because it's just a floor and we won't

103
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,700
be passing through it anyway. And then, I'd like you to position it under the camera,

104
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,700
so that you can see it when you preview the scene. And then share a

105
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,700
screenshot of your achievement. It's always good to share your achievements in the discussion, it just

106
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,700
makes them that bit more real. OK, so pause the video, and have a go at this!

107
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,700
OK welcome

108
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,700
back! I hope you've had a go and you've had some success with creating this

109
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,700
screenshot of your achievements. Now let me show you how I would

110
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,700
do it. So the first thing is first, I'm

111
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,700
going to delete this cube, because I want to start afresh.

112
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,700
And I'm going to right-click 3D Object, Cube, and create

113
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,700
a new cube. I'm just going to resize these a little bit, to give me a

114
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,700
little space in the viewport itself. OK,

115
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,700
now what I want to do is scale this

116
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,700
cube. So I'm going to get the Scale Tool, and I don't want to

117
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,700
scale it in that direction but I do want to scale it in the floor direction

118
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,700
a little bit, like so. So what have I

119
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,700
done there? Yeah that's correct, that is actually scaling it

120
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,700
all in the right directions.

121
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm going to scale out around the sides as well, just rotate a little bit around the

122
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,700
cube so I can see what I'm doing.

123
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,700
There we go! As you can see, as I scroll out my mouse actually wraps around

124
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,700
the screen to carry on the scrolling, which is a quite handy feature.

125
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Then I'm going to go back to the move, and I'm going to position this floor

126
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,700
a little bit beneath the camera. Where's my camera? It appears to be around

127
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,700
here. So as you can see, the floor is a little bit

128
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,700
far, actually not that far down at all, so we can move it down

129
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,700
a little bit farther. Now I can hit play and that will

130
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,700
preview this for me. And there you go, you can see there is a floor

131
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,700
to my gym, in front of my camera. I just want to do one more

132
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,700
thing, is to move this floor a little bit further forward, because

133
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,700
we're only looking really in the forward direction. We're going to be shooting hoops

134
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,700
in this direction! So let's hit play, and there we go,

135
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,700
we've got more of the floor in front of us! Success! Now, you just need to take a

136
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,066
screenshot of this and share it in the forums.
