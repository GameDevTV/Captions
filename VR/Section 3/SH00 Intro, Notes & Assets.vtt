1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
So welcome to Shoot

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.800
Hoop! This is going to be a lot of fun, this game! What are they going to do, Sam? In this game

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.800
you are basically a basketball player, and you're going to be looking around the scene

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.800
and shooting, basically, a first person basketball shooting game, and it

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.800
can also work in the Oculus Rift, so that's really cool! Absolutely!

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.800
And when you've done the next section you'll be able to come back and convert it to Cardboard, so

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.800
lots of possibilities! You'll be seeing Unity properly, for the first time, and really starting to learn

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.800
how Unity works. But not just that, what else will they be learning? You'll be

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.800
diving even deeper into some of the features of C# and learning

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.800
how to put all that knowledge from the last section into practice in making 3D games.

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.800
Absolutely! And of course, you're going to be learning the fundamentals of development in

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.800
VR, so that's going to be a really important point, too. What

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800
are we doing about assets for this? What are we doing about artwork, Sam? Yeah, you don't have to

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.800
worry about any of that, we've bundled everything you need in line with the lectures of this

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
course, so you just go along and we'll tell you when you need to grab those assets.

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.800
Fantastic! Absolutely! And against this lecture is a link to the Google

17
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.800
Slides, as usual, which will give you your section notes which we encourage you to take a look at,

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.800
and that can be really useful revision material. That's right, I'm so excited and

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.866
let's dive right in!
