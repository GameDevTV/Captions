00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:10,633
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be adding sound effects to the ball

2
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:14,633
colliding with the hoop. We're also going to be looking at creating

3
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:18,633
little scoring sounds, just like that! Perfect! See you in

4
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:19,633
there!

5
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:23,633
So to add a sound effect to our ball, first off, let's go into our

6
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:27,633
game scene. But we're going to need to deal with the ball itself, so what I'm going to do

7
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:31,633
is go into our ShootHoopKit or our ShootHoot, but hopefully this has changed

8
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:35,633
on yours. I'm going to move this ball into my scene, select the ball,

9
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:39,633
and I need to add a component to it, and the component is, funnily enough,

10
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,633
an Audio Source component. So we can search for that!

11
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:47,633
And it has all the exact same components, because obviously the Audio

12
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:51,633
Source game object is just an Audio Source component.

13
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,633
Perfect! So we have this Audio Source component,

14
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:59,633
and we need to add an AudioClip. So, as I said, you can just click this little

15
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:03,633
dot with a circle around it and go and look for your component. Now, the

16
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:07,633
one that I'm going to use for this is impact deep thud.

17
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:11,633
I think that's the most appropriate, from this pack.

18
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:15,633
And we don't want it to Play On Awake, we want to trigger this in a script.

19
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:19,633
OK, so just check, when you play this you shouldn't hear anything.

20
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:23,633
That's correct, nothing

21
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:27,633
is being played, in fact! So if we go to the Assets, and Scripts, and Create

22
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:31,633
ourselves a new Script that will be responsible

23
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,633
for triggering this sound, I'm going to call it the Ball

24
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,633
BounceSound.

25
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,633
And then, we can open up this script, and we want to replace

26
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:47,633
all of this, essentially, with an OnCollision.

27
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:51,633
So void OnCollision

28
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:55,633
Enter(Collision

29
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:59,633
collision). And you should be getting fairly used to that signature, by now.

30
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:03,633
And then, what we want to do is get hold of that Audio

31
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:07,633
Source. So I'm going to create a variable for it, AudioSource, call it

32
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:11,633
source, and then, GetComponent.

33
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:15,633
And the component type's AudioSource, and

34
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:19,633
then, on the source, all you have to do is call the, funnily enough,

35
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:23,633
the Play() method. Surprise! Surprise! So we

36
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:27,633
can just try that out now! I'll save the script.

37
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:31,633
It's having trouble saving, so

38
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:35,633
we'll just move between them, and there we go, move between the tabs and then that's saved.

39
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,633
And then, I want to drag that script on to

40
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:43,633
the ball, so let's get the BallBounce script, put it

41
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:47,633
on the ball, save, and play!

42
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:51,633
[Ball Bouncing Sound] There we

43
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,633
go! Perfect, we're hearing multiple bounces! That's exactly

44
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,633
what we need! Now, let's go into our Assets and ShootHoop

45
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:03,633
Kit, and we want to drag this ball back onto that prefab,

46
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:07,633
so that everything that is launched is essentially just a copy of that ball with

47
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:11,633
all the audio scripts, etc.

48
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:15,633
There we go! Now, I can fire all the balls I want, and

49
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,633
I'm drowned out by the sound of bouncing balls. Perfect!

50
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,633
Finally, we're getting somewhere with this

51
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:27,633
sound! So, now we can move that ball from

52
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:31,633
our scene. And one thing we forgot to do was actually bring this

53
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:35,633
RingBoard, that we'd added all these nice boxes to. If you notice, all the

54
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,633
other ones don't have those, that's because we didn't drag it back onto the prefab, so

55
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,633
let's do that now! Now, if we check all the others, you see that they can all

56
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:47,633
now score, as well. Maybe you noticed that when you were playing around with the game for

57
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:51,633
yourself. Perfect!

58
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,733
So now, it's up to you to create a scoring sound, so a little

59
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:00,733
sound that we make, when we actually have scored a basket.

60
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,733
So I'd like you to add an Audio Source Component, and I'm not telling you to

61
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:08,733
what, you'll have to figure that one out for yourself. And I'd like you to find

62
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:12,733
a good sound, the right sort that might, you know,

63
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:16,733
sound like a goal scoring, and then, find and trigger

64
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:20,733
in the appropriate place. So again,

65
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,733
just try and use all your knowledge about how

66
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,733
we place things and what structures we use to figure this out,

67
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:32,733
and just, you know, try for 30 minutes. If you can't figure it out and you're still scratching

68
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:36,733
your head, then come back to this video. OK, so pause and have a go!

69
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:40,733
OK, welcome back! So I hope you've had a go at this head

70
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:44,733
scratcher, and let's dive right in! So

71
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:48,733
the place I'm going to put this is actually... Well let's think about where I'm going to call it,

72
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:52,733
for the first place! I'm actually going to call it where we score a goal. So where do we score

73
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:56,733
a goal? Well we actually score a goal in our LevelManager.

74
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:00,733
So if we look at our LevelManager, that has a LevelManager

75
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,733
script, and that's where we're going to call it from. So if I go to my

76
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:08,733
Scripts, I can go to the LevelManager script.

77
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:12,733
Let's open that up! And, as you see, we have a

78
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:16,733
LoadNextScene. Nope sorry, LevelManager is not the one I'm thinking

79
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,733
of, I'm thinking of the ScoreKeeper! My bad! So it'll

80
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:24,733
open up the ScoreKeeper instead, and in fact, we have the IncrementScore. So

81
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:28,733
that's exactly what we want, we want to call it, instead of this print statement let's get rid of that,

82
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,733
that obsolete print statement. What we want to do is essentially get

83
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,733
this code, which was in, if I

84
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:40,733
can remember correctly... I cannot remember

85
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,733
correctly from there, so I think it's in here somewhere. Yes, it's the BallBounce

86
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:48,733
script. We want to copy this code over

87
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:52,733
into our ScoreKeeper. So we Increment the Score, then

88
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:56,733
we play a score sound. Now, this is not going

89
00:05:56,733 --> 00:06:00,733
to work right now, because we have no AudioSource on the ScoreKeeper, but

90
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:04,733
we can fix that. So we'll go to the ScoreKeeper, Add a

91
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:08,733
Component, add an Audio Source, and find

92
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:12,733
the sound. And the sound I'm going to use is this chimebell.

93
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:16,733
Let's get that! OK, let's hit play

94
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:20,733
and find out what the sound of scoring is! [Loud Chime Ringing] Something

95
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:24,733
vaguely like that, by the sounds [Laughs] of it!

96
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,733
Let's just try and get it to

97
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:32,733
go in, rather than bounce around the rim. [Repeating Popping Ball Sounds]

98
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:36,733
[Ringing Chime Sound] There we go, our chime sound!

99
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:40,733
But you did notice, that when we start the game, [Chime Ringing]

100
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,733
we get that chime, and the reason for that is I forgot to uncheck

101
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:48,733
Play On Awake. So if we now save our scene, hit play,

102
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:52,733
and try that again, now

103
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:56,733
it should only play [Chime Ringing] when we score!

104
00:06:56,733 --> 00:07:00,733
Perfect! So well done, you have a really nice immersive game now,

105
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,733
which has sound effects and it has music and is

106
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:08,733
starting to look quite pretty. Just one thing I'd like to change to make it look

107
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,733
a little bit better is this ground, it's a little bit small. So let's make it

108
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:16,733
extend 1,000 in each direction, and this should basically

109
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:20,733
take it off to the horizon.

110
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,733
There we go! Now, let's hit play! There we go!

111
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:28,733
We've got balls until the horizon, it's perfect!

112
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:32,733
OK, all this game needs now is for you to give it to a friend and

113
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:36,133
see whether it's as good as you think it is!
