00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.900
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be controlling the camera's rotation,

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.900
using some mouse input, as you can see me doing here, [Laughs] making you all

3
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.900
feel really sick by the way that I'm moving around here! OK,

4
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.433
so let's dive right in, before you all vomit! [Laughs]

5
00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:26.433
So it's all very well as rotating just

6
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:30.433
by time, but what if we want to get some better rotation,

7
00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:34.433
some rotation by mouse input, so that we can

8
00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:38.433
really effectively control where we're looking and

9
00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:42.433
point the basketball in the right direction.

10
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:46.433
So the thing I want to introduce you to is, if you we look in

11
00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:50.433
Window and then we... In actual fact, sorry, if we go to Edit,

12
00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:54.433
then down to Project Settings, and what we're looking

13
00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:58.433
for is the Input menu item. And

14
00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:02.433
you'll see in the Inspector, we get an Input Manager pop-up and something called Axes. You need to

15
00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:06.433
expand Axes to see what we're talking about. And Axes are basically

16
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.433
the things like joy sticks or mice that you can

17
00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:14.433
use to get analog input, like this,

18
00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.433
analog input, which we can also talk about as floating point numbers.

19
00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:22.433
So how do we get hold of our mouse input? Well we

20
00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:26.433
just do something like, so if I create a new float

21
00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:30.433
mouseX.

22
00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:34.433
Then, I'm going to do an Input.Get

23
00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:38.433
Axis. You see that, Axis corresponding

24
00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:42.433
to the Axes in the Input Manager!

25
00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:46.433
And then, we've got to put the name of the axis, so

26
00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:50.433
if we have a look we want Mouse X.

27
00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:54.433
So ("Mouse space X")

28
00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:58.433
like so. It's not so nice that it uses strings. You know the keyboard

29
00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:02.433
previously had a way that would correct it, automatically catch it when we

30
00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:06.433
compile, our Editor would show a little squiggly line, if..but

31
00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:10.433
here I can just type total nonsense and it won't pick it up.

32
00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:14.433
That's not so nice but unfortunately that is the way we need to do things.

33
00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:18.433
So if we hit play,

34
00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:22.433
let's have a look and see whether this has been affected

35
00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:26.433
at all. No, at the moment, it has not

36
00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:30.433
been affected, but

37
00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:34.433
that is because we haven't changed here. What I want to do is put mouse

38
00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:38.433
X into our rotation.

39
00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:42.433
Let's see what that does!

40
00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:46.433
So now, you see, as I turn my mouse

41
00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.433
I am getting a rotation in the X and Y

42
00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:54.433
axes. Excellent! [Laughs] So I'm not getting it in the

43
00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:58.433
Y axis, rather I am just getting it in the X. So we can

44
00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:02.433
rotate left and right. Now, I want to do up and down,

45
00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:06.100
so we can do this in a similar way.

46
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.100
OK, so here is your challenge! I would like you to

47
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.100
attempt to rotate up and down now. So you'll need to

48
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.100
use the mouse Y axis and create a new variable for that, and I'll let you

49
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.100
figure out how to do the exact details of that. And then, you need to

50
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.100
choose which dimension you want to rotate in and update the

51
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.100
Quaternion accordingly. So pause this video and have a

52
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.100
go at that! OK welcome back! I hope

53
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.100
you've all had a go! Remember that attempting really does help it stick!

54
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.100
So let's have a look! Well I want to create

55
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.100
a new axis, so I'm going to copy and paste this and create a mouse

56
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.100
Y float. And we're going to get the Y axis here

57
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.100
and then I want to rotate it. Now let's just

58
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.100
put it in randomly somewhere, mouseY somewhere like that and

59
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.100
figure out where it is rotating. OK, so let's hit

60
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.100
play! And that' seems to be

61
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.100
going up and down but kind of in the wrong direction.

62
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.100
So how can we solve that? Well quite easily, we can put a minus

63
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.100
sign, and that should change the direction of that rotation.

64
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.100
So hit play and now you can

65
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.100
see it's going in the right direction, but it's a little bit slow. So how do we fix that?

66
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.100
Again, very simply all we need to do is have a rotation speed

67
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.100
float. So

68
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.100
this is very much the same as we did in our Ball

69
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.100
Spawner. So remember here we had a velocity that we

70
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.100
increased it by. In fact, that's not a velocity! A velocity has

71
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.100
the direction, so it's actually a speed so let's rename that! It's a good

72
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.100
good practice to rename things, when you notice that they are named incorrectly. So

73
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.100
in VisualStudio you can just right-click here and do Rename. On Mac

74
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.100
you need to click, and then there's a little arrow to the side which you can click and then

75
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.100
it allows you to rename. In fact, on MonoDevelop it's probably

76
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.100
slightly different; I think a right-click and rename will probably do the trick. So

77
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.100
I'm going to rename this to be speed

78
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.100
instead. Then, I hit the Apply button

79
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.100
and go back to our camera rotation. And here I've got rotationSpeed,

80
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.100
and I'm just going to perhaps do 5 here as well.

81
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.100
And then, I'm going to just multiply by rotationSpeed

82
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.100
in both of these cases,

83
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.100
like so.

84
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.100
OK, now let's go back to Unity,

85
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.100
play,

86
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.100
and here we are! Now it is rotating a little bit better!

87
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.100
And you'll [Laughs] notice that we have some pretty funky behavior going

88
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.100
on here, as we rotate, and we're going to sort all of that out in the

89
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.100
next lecture, with a Camera Gimbal. OK,

90
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.666
see you there!
