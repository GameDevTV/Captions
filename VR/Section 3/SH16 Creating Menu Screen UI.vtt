1
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:11.166
Welcome! In this video we are going to be creating pretty splash screens, like you see

2
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:15.166
here, allowing ourselves to progress between them as we have

3
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:19.166
previously. And we're also going to be creating a game over screen, which is very

4
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:23.166
much similar to the splash screen we saw before but with a different image.

5
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.900
So let's dive right in!

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.900
So our splash screen, at the moment, [Laughs] is a little bit of a joke!

7
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.900
I wouldn't really call it so much of a splash screen as an empty screen,

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.900
so what we want to do is actually add some UI that will

9
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.900
allow us to introduce the player to the game. So

10
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.900
fortunately, that is again very easy in Unity, all we have to do is right-click

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.900
in our Hierarchy, go to the UI, and

12
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.900
we want to select a Canvas, first of all. So that

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.900
is the basis of which we make all our UI. Now, yours may not

14
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.900
be centered, yours might look something more like this. To center it, just double-

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.900
click on the Canvas and that will get you there, and what you also want to do is make

16
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.900
sure you are in 2D mode. So you can just hit 2D on

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.900
your viewport, and that will flip you over there. And one more thing

18
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.900
is, we want to select this right-most tool here, which

19
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.900
is basically for rescaling 2D elements,

20
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.900
which is exactly what we need. So you can see it gives us these kind of handles.

21
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.900
OK so what we're going to need to do is add in an image

22
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.900
here, a background image, that is the first thing that will make the biggest

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.900
difference. So let's go looking for them! I'm going to

24
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.900
just Google for "basketball" images, but

25
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.900
I do suggest you're careful, because you need to make sure

26
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
you have rights. So if you were just to copy anything off of Google,

27
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.900
you wouldn't be able to distribute the game, it would be against copyright law, so make sure you

28
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.900
just hit this Search Tools button, and then, under Usage Rights,

29
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.900
select something that is Labeled For Reuse and that will allow you

30
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.900
to sell the game. If you're not going to sell the game, just share it, then just go for Labeled

31
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.900
for Noncommercial Reuse. And if you're going to

32
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.900
modify, you obviously need modification and so on, but this will basically

33
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.900
filter down, based on licenses that you can use. Now, you can

34
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.900
take your pick from the list of images, that shows up here.

35
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.900
I'm going to go with this one, I think that's fairly nice.

36
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.900
And this one comes from a website called Pixabay, which is quite common. You

37
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.900
may have to scroll down to find the image again but it's here. They

38
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.900
do a lot of good free public domain images. So I'm

39
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900
going to download, not the original size. You can get the original size but

40
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.900
you need to sign up for it, I don't particularly want to. And then,

41
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.900
this is very easy, we can just drag that file into Unity, but first, I'm going to

42
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.900
Create a Folder for my images. So right-click, Create, Folder,

43
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.900
Images, and I'm going to just

44
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.900
drag over into that folder.

45
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.900
So it should import. There it is! Now, it's the one

46
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.900
you see. It's turned it into a square, which is a little bit annoying but

47
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.900
we will sort that out later.

48
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.900
And now what we want to do is right-click on our Canvas, because we want to create a

49
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.900
child of the Canvas. Go into UI,

50
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.900
and then, select the Raw Image option.

51
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900
So that will allow us to create a raw image

52
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.900
texture, if we go to the Inspector and we drag our image

53
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.900
into it's Texture field. There you go, we're starting

54
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.900
to see the light. We have our image, but

55
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.900
it's a little bit annoying, because the scale isn't quite right.

56
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.900
So let's just go back to the website and I noticed that when

57
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.900
I hit Free Download there was the scale there, so it's

58
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.900
1280. Let me stick that in!

59
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.900
1280

60
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.900
and then, 853.

61
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.900
So I've got the image size right!

62
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.900
Now, I just need to use the Scale Tool, and if you click and drag

63
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.900
on the center box, it does a proportionate scale. And I'm just going to scale the

64
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.900
whole thing, and I'm going to move this image to be centered,

65
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.900
which fortunately there are some snapping tools to help me out.

66
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.900
And I am going to just scale it so that it fills the whole screen.

67
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.900
Now, let's hit play and see what that looks like! OK, better but not

68
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.900
perfect, because we're still seeing this world around the edges, which we really don't

69
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.900
want to be seeing. Now, the way we fix that is by clicking on the

70
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.900
Canvas, then going into our

71
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.900
Canvas Scaler, and selecting Scale with Screen

72
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.900
Size. Now, you'll notice that changes our Canvas size, somewhat. We need to

73
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.900
adjust the size of our RawImage, this way.

74
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.900
So I'm going to click RawImage and just,

75
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.900
there we go, make sure it is big enough. I'll save my scene.

76
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.900
Now, let's hit play! OK, much better! Now

77
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.900
you know, I can even adjust the size of this window

78
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.900
to make sure that everything is going to fit on the screen.

79
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.900
I suggest you do the same thing, is try out for different screen

80
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.900
scale sizes, like so. It's all going to

81
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.900
look alright, whether you play it on an iPod or an iPhone

82
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.900
or on your computer and on different computer screens.

83
00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:41.933
So your challenge, this lecture, is to create a game over

84
00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:45.933
scene! So we've just created a menu screen, and I'd like you to use

85
00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:49.933
all that knowledge and replicate it to create your own new scene.

86
00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.933
So, as I said, create a scene, and then, put it last

87
00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:57.933
in the build order, because that is the order in which we want to see these scenes.

88
00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:01.933
And add a canvas with a background image, just like we've

89
00:06:01.933 --> 00:06:05.933
done, just replicate those steps, and make it reachable

90
00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:09.933
from the game. So I don't know how you're going to do that,

91
00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:13.933
it depends. You can choose many different ways, but

92
00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:17.933
perhaps using some input from the keyboard and some

93
00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:21.933
components, perhaps, that we've already made, you'll be able to reach the game over

94
00:06:21.933 --> 00:06:25.933
screen from the game. I'm not saying create a game over condition

95
00:06:25.933 --> 00:06:29.933
but you could try that too if you like, but we'll be covering those in later lectures. So

96
00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:33.933
let's pause the video and have a go!

97
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.500
OK, welcome back! Let's dive right into

98
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.500
doing this! So the first thing I'm going to

99
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.500
do is go into my _Scenes and right-click Create

100
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.500
and select Scene. This one is going to be

101
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.500
03_GameOver. Notice

102
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.500
I'm using Camel Case there, as well, starting with a capital G.

103
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.500
And then, what I want to do is go into this game, save

104
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.500
my menu scene. When I switch, you always have to make sure you're saving the scene.

105
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.500
And then, I'm going to create a UI Canvas.

106
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.500
I'm going to, while I'm here, set the scale

107
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.500
to be Scale With Screen Size. So I've done that

108
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.500
straight away. I'm going to right-click on my Canvas, I'm going to add

109
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.500
a Raw Image, and then, I might go and

110
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.500
pick out a different image from the list of those

111
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.500
basketball images. Let's see what might be a good one.

112
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.500
I think this one looks fairly good, just open that up!

113
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.500
OK, you've got a free download of that!

114
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.500
I need to Save Image As,

115
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.500
stick it in the Downloads, and

116
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.500
just drag it into the Assets.

117
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.500
So I'm going to drag it into my Images folder.

118
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.500
Done right! Now, I can take the Raw

119
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.500
Image and drag that image onto its Texture field,

120
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.500
and again, I'm going to need to get the resolution right, which is a bit of a pain.

121
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.500
But let's just do this one by

122
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.500
eye. So I can

123
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.500
select the UI Tool here,

124
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.500
so that is the fifth one along, and I can just

125
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.500
scale it until it's approximately right. I think we'll get away

126
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.500
with that. That's definitely more than that.

127
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.500
Let's make sure that this is vaguely spherical. That'll do the trick!

128
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.500
OK that's looking fairly OK.

129
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.500
And I'm just going to use the Scale Tool now to just scale

130
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.500
everything proportionally outwards, and

131
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.500
let's hit play and see what that scene looks like!

132
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.500
OK, yes much better, we can

133
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.500
quite clearly see everything is fitting in the screen.

134
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.500
I'm going to save that scene, and I said I need to

135
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.500
put it in the Build Order. So File, Build Settings, let's

136
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.500
add... You can hit either Add Open Scene or you can drag the scene in.

137
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.500
I'm going to hit Add Open Scene. It's automatically added it in third

138
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.500
place, in build order number 2. So that is good!

139
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.500
That's where we want it to be! Now, let's go into our _Scenes

140
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.500
folder and open up the game. So how are we

141
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.500
going to progress? Well I say we'll just create a

142
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.500
LevelManager in here, as well. So create a new GameObject, say Level

143
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.500
Manager.

144
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.500
And then, get this LevelManager script, that we already have written,

145
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.500
because scripts are shared between scenes, and we can just stick that on the Level

146
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.500
Manager, so it has a LevelManager script component. And as we know, the LevelManager

147
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.500
script does, in fact, wait for the Spacebar, and then, it progresses to the

148
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.500
next level. So if we hit play now...

149
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.500
OK, the lighting's gone a bit weird here, but if we hit

150
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.500
Spacebar, there we go we move on to our game over

151
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.500
scene! So in total, if we started

152
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.500
with our Menu screen, we should be able to now get all the way

153
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.500
through to all our scenes. From there, to our game, and

154
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.500
from our game, on to the game over screen! Perfect! A

155
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.600
challenge successfully completed! See you in the next video!
