00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:11.433
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! In this video we are going to be looking at how we can play

2
00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.433
with buttons! So something like this where we can click it, we can play, blah

3
00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:19.433
blah blah, the game is over, and I can play again!

4
00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:23.433
How exciting, I can play as many times as I like, even though the

5
00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.433
game can't actually be over yet! OK, let's dive right in!

6
00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.233
So ideally we wouldn't be hitting space here but rather

7
00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:36.233
clicking a button, and this is certainly the case in our game over screen, where

8
00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:40.233
hitting space doesn't actually do anything, because

9
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:44.233
we don't even have the LevelManger. But if we had the LevelManager in this scene,

10
00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:48.233
then hitting space would simply progress forward,

11
00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:52.233
and we don't want to progress forward we want to go back. So how do

12
00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:56.233
we deal with these cases? How do we make the level of control, the

13
00:00:56.233 --> 00:01:00.233
key that is being hit, slightly different to whether we go forward or

14
00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:04.233
back. Well what we're going to do is introduce a new

15
00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:08.233
concept, a new UI concept, called a button. So let's right-

16
00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:12.233
click on the Canvas, go to UI, and select the Button

17
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:16.233
object. OK now I'm going to rename this button to

18
00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:20.233
something a little bit more meaningful, like PlayButton,

19
00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:24.233
and I'm going to position it in the right place. I'm actually going to

20
00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:28.233
keep this text around, to use it as a

21
00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:32.233
subtitle, to the SHOOT HOOP. I'm just going

22
00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:36.233
to change it to

23
00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:40.233
"RACE THE CLOCK." Like that!

24
00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:44.233
And I'm going to put my button, probably around

25
00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:48.233
down here. OK. Now, we want

26
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:52.233
to change its size a little bit and make it a little bit bigger,

27
00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:56.233
and what we also want to do is, underneath, if you

28
00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:00.233
expand the PlayButton, you'll notice there is a child object, which is the Text.

29
00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:04.233
So we want to apply the consistent font to that Text. So

30
00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:08.233
I'm going to select the Text, drag the font into its field,

31
00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:12.233
and I actually want the background for this

32
00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:16.233
thing to be white, but I do want

33
00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:20.233
the text to be different color. To make it clear that this is an action item, we're going to make the

34
00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:24.233
text red, and we're going to make the text big, and we're going to make the text say

35
00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:28.233
PLAY, so it's very clear what exactly

36
00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:32.233
this does. OK, now if we

37
00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:36.233
hit play, let's see what this button looks like. So I mouse over,

38
00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:40.233
it goes slightly gray. That's a bit too subtle for my liking, I think

39
00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:44.233
we'll want to make it go a lot more gray than that. So Highlight

40
00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:48.233
Color is what we're looking for, under the Button (Script), so select

41
00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:52.233
that, bring it down to a much darker gray like

42
00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:56.233
that, hit play,

43
00:02:56.233 --> 00:03:00.233
and as you mouse over now it's much more obvious that we're about to do

44
00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:04.233
something clicking. It just makes it a lighter gray again, so let's make

45
00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:08.233
the Pressed Color be

46
00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:12.233
a light red of sorts, like that.

47
00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:16.233
So now, it should be really obvious. Mouse over,

48
00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:20.233
PLAY, very very obvious. OK, I'm much more happy

49
00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:24.233
with that, in terms of a way of controlling! But how do

50
00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:28.233
we actually hook this button up? With buttons it's very

51
00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:32.233
easy! You'll notice that, in the Inspector, we have this On Click () section.

52
00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:36.233
If you hit the + button, then what we need is an object and a

53
00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:40.233
function. So we need to drag in an object, and luckily we already have a Level

54
00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:44.233
Manager, so I'm going to drag in the LevelManager. And then, the function we want

55
00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:48.233
is under the LevelManager component, so you have to go to that, and then, we want

56
00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:52.233
to load the next level. But that's not showing up in our list, now I wonder why?

57
00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:56.233
Le's go over to the code and just check! Ah,

58
00:03:56.233 --> 00:04:00.233
so you'll notice here that it's not a public function, so it can't be called by other

59
00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:04.233
scripts, and that's what we're seeing, that it isn't showing up. So if we

60
00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:08.233
put public in front of our method, it should make it accessible

61
00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:12.233
to that button. So I select the button,

62
00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:16.233
go to Function, LevelManager, and now we have

63
00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:20.233
LoadNextScene (). Perfect! I'm going to hit save,

64
00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:24.233
and go to play, and now if I hit

65
00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:28.233
PLAY, I get the scene! And if I hit Space I

66
00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:32.233
get the game over scene, but I cannot go any

67
00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:33.966
further than this,

68
00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:37.966
so hopefully this is what you're going to fix in this challenge! I'd like you to add a

69
00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:41.966
Play Again Button! Now, use your old knowledge that you have

70
00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:45.966
so far, from this lecture, to achieve that with buttons, and

71
00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:49.966
I would like you to also bring in the LevelManager script into the

72
00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:53.966
scene. It's needed in order for us to manage levels.

73
00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:57.966
And then, you'll need a LoadPrevious

74
00:04:57.966 --> 00:05:01.966
Level() on that LevelManager script, so we'll add in this extra

75
00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:05.966
method to go back a level. Because remember, the game over screen

76
00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:09.966
is the last thing in the build order, so we need to go back

77
00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:13.966
if we want to play again. And then, add your button, add your play again

78
00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:17.966
button, do all the text styling, etc. You could probably copy it over from the first screen,

79
00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:21.966
in fact, and hook it all up. OK, so pause the video and have a go!

80
00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:25.966
OK welcome back!

81
00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:29.966
I'm going to dive right in and have a go at this! So the

82
00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:33.966
first thing I'm going to do is copy over my button. So I'm going to

83
00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:37.966
take this PlayButton and copy it and go into the game

84
00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:41.966
over and paste it onto the Canvas. So I'm going to expand the Canvas, Paste,

85
00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:45.966
and hope that it'll go underneath, but it doesn't, so I have to drag it into the Canvas.

86
00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:49.966
And I'm going to put my PLAY AGAIN at the bottom.

87
00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:53.966
This time we're going to remove the instructions, because I don't really have a

88
00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:57.966
subtitle [Laughs] for GAME OVER! I'll put the PLAY down here. I'm going to

89
00:05:57.966 --> 00:06:01.966
rename it or rename the text anyway, change the text to

90
00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:05.966
let's see, Play AGAIN question

91
00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:09.966
mark. And I'll make the button big enough to fit

92
00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:13.966
that all in, I need to go into the button to do that.

93
00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:17.966
Make it larger, center it again.

94
00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:21.966
Alright, and let's just preview this scene!

95
00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:25.966
Now obviously, when I click nothing is happening,

96
00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:29.966
which is obvious, but

97
00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:33.966
you'll notice that there is an On Click () handler that is empty,

98
00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:37.966
in Inspector, so that's what got copied over. This is

99
00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:41.966
why we need to Create our Empty GameObject, call it LevelManager.

100
00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:45.966
And we go into our

101
00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:49.966
Scripts folder, and bring the

102
00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:53.966
LevelManager into the game. OK.

103
00:06:53.966 --> 00:06:57.966
I'm going to hit save, and I don't really need

104
00:06:57.966 --> 00:07:01.966
play to know what's going to happen. So I'll go do the button and

105
00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:05.966
try and pull the LevelManager on. Obviously we don't have any

106
00:07:05.966 --> 00:07:09.966
function that we want, at the moment, and need the LoadNextLevel. So we need to write that,

107
00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:13.966
and I'm going to write it, pretty much, by copying the LoadNext levels.

108
00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:17.966
So I'm going to copy it over, call it Load

109
00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:21.966
PreviousScene(). So

110
00:07:21.966 --> 00:07:25.966
I lied a little bit about the name, I'm calling it PreviousScene,

111
00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:29.966
and then, we just want to do a -1 instead of a +1. Very very simple.

112
00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:33.966
Very very simple. So, in fact, I don't want this Key

113
00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:37.966
Down. Actually, I do want the KeyDown, because this KeyDown is what allows us

114
00:07:37.966 --> 00:07:41.966
to move on during the game, until we have a game over condition.

115
00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:45.966
And I'm going to go over to Unity!

116
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:49.966
I do believe I accidentally started up another Unity, but it seems to be fine with that.

117
00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:53.966
Let's hit play and see if we can go back!

118
00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:57.966
OK now we can't, because I haven't connected up, so we go to the PlayButton,

119
00:07:57.966 --> 00:08:01.966
go down to select the function LevelManager,

120
00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:05.966
and LoadPreviousScene (). Now that should do the trick! Let's hit play

121
00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:09.966
and finally see whether this works or not! Yes it does!

122
00:08:09.966 --> 00:08:13.966
So now, I've just gone back a scene, I hit space, I go forward, back,

123
00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:17.966
and forward. You know, I can just get stuck in this loop forever,

124
00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:21.966
basically. So success, we managed to connect

125
00:08:21.966 --> 00:08:25.966
up both of these buttons to do what we wanted with the LevelManager.

126
00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:29.966
So well done! Pat yourself on the back, and then, move on

127
00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:32.400
to the next video!
