00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:12,633
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be looking at adding text to our

2
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:16,633
splash screen and menu screen, and then, we're going to be looking at how we can

3
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:20,633
do that for both that and the game over screen, changing colors a little bit and

4
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:24,633
changing the saturation of the background like this. So

5
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,933
let's dive right in!

6
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:30,933
So the game is looking quite professional with these different

7
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:34,933
screens showing up, but they're not very useful without

8
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,933
much text. They're not very informative to our user, so

9
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,933
let's correct that, let's start adding in some text.

10
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:46,933
So to do that, we right-click again on our Canvas, and

11
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,933
I am going to go to the UI and select Text,

12
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:54,933
funnily enough, and I'm going to put in a title here, so Shoot

13
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,933
Hoop. And what we need to do is increase

14
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,933
this Font Size, and we also need to change the boundary

15
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:06,933
of this container. So if we go in here, we'll make this really large,

16
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,933
because I want our title to be about this sort of size. I'm going to

17
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,933
stick it in that black area, I'm going to bring it right out.

18
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:18,933
I'm going to change the alignment, so that it

19
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:22,933
is Right Aligned, increase

20
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,933
the size, change the color.

21
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:30,933
There we go! However, it does

22
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,933
look rather dull with this font, but before we go searching for fonts,

23
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:38,933
I just want to change some of these names. So RawImage is

24
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:42,933
the first one I don't like, I want that to be Background. Just so that

25
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:46,933
the names are always meaningful, this one's going to be Title.

26
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:50,933
And there we go! So now, this

27
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:54,933
looks a bit dull. Let's just preview it. Ariel is

28
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:58,933
fine as a font but not the most interesting, for sure. So

29
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:02,933
let's go back over and I'm going to use DaFont

30
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:06,933
for my fonts,

31
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,933
if I don't accidentally lock my screen.

32
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,933
So we'll go to dafont.com,

33
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:18,933
and you can search through their massive collections of fonts for whatever

34
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:22,933
seems most basketball related to you. I'm going to go for something

35
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:26,933
that is Brush stroke. So kind of looking like graffiti

36
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:30,933
is the thing I'm going for. Something like this but you need to check the license,

37
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:34,933
and here it's free for personal use. And because this isn't for personal use,

38
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,933
it's for a course, I'm going to be looking for something that is 100% free.

39
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:42,933
Perhaps like this one here, EDO SZ. So

40
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:46,933
I'm going to hit Download on that, and then,

41
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,933
unfortunately, because it's in a .zip, I need to show it in the folder and

42
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:54,933
I need to Extract this file,

43
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:58,933
like so. And then, I can just

44
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:02,933
drag that into my Assets folder,

45
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,933
but I do want to put it in a Fonts folder. So I'm going to right-click, Create a new

46
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:10,933
Folder, Fonts, and drag

47
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:14,933
that font into my Fonts folder. Perfect!

48
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:18,933
Alright, now on my title I can finally

49
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,933
drag that font onto the title's

50
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:26,933
Font field. As you see, we instantly get the

51
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:30,933
nice new shiny font coming up, and I can just make it a little bit bigger,

52
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:34,933
Save my scene, and hit play. Let's see what that actually looks

53
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:38,933
like! Cool, this is actually starting to look fairly

54
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:42,933
swish! So I'm going to duplicate

55
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:46,933
this Title text, so that I get all the formatting that I

56
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:50,933
previously setup, and I'm going to move it down, keep it in line, and I'm going to

57
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,933
use this to give the player some instructions. So

58
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,933
"HIT SPACE TO PLAY".

59
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:02,933
Now obviously, this is too big, so I'm going to scale that back down,

60
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,933
and I'm going to rename the object

61
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:10,933
to Instructions,

62
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:14,933
I'm going to hit Enter, save,

63
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,933
and let's play. This is looking better, I'm

64
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:22,933
going to just Bottom Align it, so

65
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:26,933
that the symmetry is a little better. Alright,

66
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,933
perfect! This looks really good! And remember, you'll need to check with

67
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:34,933
different screen resolutions, that everything is looking fine.

68
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:38,933
So bring it into a full by full kind of resolution.

69
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:42,933
You see everything still fits. In my case, we

70
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:46,933
may need to tweak things around, if your font is in a slightly different

71
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:50,933
location, than it is on mine.

72
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:55,033
Time for your challenge! I would like you to update the game over

73
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:59,033
scene, now with your knowledge about text and fonts. So

74
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:03,033
to do that, I'd like you to add some styled text to that scene,

75
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:07,033
and I'd like you to add some instructions, as well. So a title

76
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:11,033
and some instructions and just let your creativity run wild, do what you

77
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:15,033
like with the game over scene. Do what you like with the intro scene, in fact, and share what you

78
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:19,033
have, share in the discussions please. OK, so pause the video and have a go!

79
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:23,033
OK welcome back!

80
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:27,033
I'm going to dive in and replicate my content! So

81
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:31,033
to do that, I am actually just going to copy these two pieces of text,

82
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:35,033
to save me redoing the formatting. So I'll go into _Scenes

83
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:39,033
and open up the GameOver, make sure I Save my menu,

84
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:43,033
and I'm going to right-click on the Canvas to hit Paste, so that I...

85
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:47,033
Well, they should have been childed, so we'll need to drag them in

86
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:51,033
to the Canvas. OK, so now the message,

87
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:55,033
we've got SHOOT HOOP, I actually want this to be GAME OVER.

88
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:59,033
I'm going to Center-Align, as well. So Center-Aligning like

89
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:03,033
that. You can then drag to the

90
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:07,033
center...

91
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:11,033
...

92
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:15,033
...of the screen, like so, and it

93
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:19,033
snaps and everything. And now, we

94
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:23,033
add some instructions. So "Hit Space to

95
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:27,033
try again",

96
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:31,033
and then, we go like so

97
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:35,033
and

98
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:39,033
let's just make this into a game over text,

99
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:43,033
like so.

100
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:47,033
And while we're at it, let's just change the text to being red! And that is a

101
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:51,033
nice, good, game over sign isn't it , when your text is

102
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:55,033
red? OK, so I'm going to preview that!

103
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:59,033
Excellent! It seems fairly clear, GAME OVER and

104
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:03,033
HIT SPACE TO TRY AGAIN. Now, the background is slightly overpowering here,

105
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:07,033
so I'm gong to select my RawImage, which I should rename to background

106
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:11,033
which I'm doing right now. And what we want to

107
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:15,033
do is slightly adjust this, adjust its color

108
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:19,033
perhaps. So let's try adjusting, there you go! We can change it so it fades

109
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:23,033
out a little bit to black, like

110
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:27,033
so. And now, the contrast is good enough that we can quite easily read

111
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:31,033
GAME OVER and HIT SPACE BAR TO TRY AGAIN. Obviously, spacebar

112
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:35,033
doesn't work, but we are going to be looking at how we can fix that,

113
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:39,033
in our next lecture! See you there!
