00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:10,533
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be

2
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:14,533
overviewing rotation and how rotation can be a little bit weird

3
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,533
at times. And we're also going to be looking at parenting of

4
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,533
objects. As you can see, this is what's happening in our Hierarchy,

5
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:26,533
at the moment. And in total, what we're going to achieve is creating a

6
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:30,533
Camera Gimbal, which allows us to not have

7
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:34,533
any weird tilting in our camera view.

8
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,533
OK let's dive right in!

9
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:40,000
So you may have noticed a problem in the way that our

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Look script currently works.Â So, for example, going up and

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
down, at the moment, is just fine, but when I turn off to the side and

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
go up and down, I start to tilt a little bit like this. And then, what's worse,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
if I go left again that tilt remains. So what

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
on Earth is going on here? [Laughs] it's slightly making me feel sick, in fact!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So to find out the reason for this, we need

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to consider, essentially, what looks like

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a model of a person. So I'm going to create, very quickly, a rough model

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
of a person, and I'm going to do this with two cubes for the shoulders

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and for the head. So first off, the cube for the body.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm just going to make it a little bit taller and

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a little bit broader shouldered. So that is the cube for the body.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And then, I'm going to create a new cube and just have that

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
as the cube for the head, and I'm going to stick it there on top of the

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
body, just floating a little bit. So hopefully that makes sense as a person to

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you. We will make the Z direction, so this direction where his

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
face is pointing. That will be his happy smiley face! And

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
this is his body with no neck, a floating head,

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but I think you get the picture. Now, one concept I want to

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
introduce you to, in this Hierarchy, of why

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
it's called a Hierarchy rather than a list, is that we can actually parent

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
objects to or put objects

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
inside other objects, so it's called parenting. And I'm going to do that by creating an empty

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
object, and we're going to just call this object the Body.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Or in fact, I'll call it the Person,

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and then, this object we said was the Body.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And this object we said was

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the head, so I've just renamed these. And now I can

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
drag that Head onto the person. You see it goes one level indented

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
underneath. And basically, what that allows me to do is group the

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Head and the Body into what we now call a Person.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So what happens is, what's quite nice is, if I move

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
this Person it moves both the Head and the Body,

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and fortunately also works for rotation. So if I rotate,

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I rotate both the Head and the Body. Now,

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I want to show you why what we were doing ended up

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
being wrong. So rotation is a little bit weird, it's not like

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
movement that we can do. With a movement we can happily first

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
move in this direction, and then, so if I move in that direction

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
then I can move in that direction. That's exactly the same as if I had first

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
moved in this direction and then moved in this direction. You see, I end up in

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
exactly the same place. So that is a nice property of movement there, it doesn't matter which

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
order we move in but it's going to have the exact same result.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, with rotation it's not the same.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So if I rotate by this and then like this,

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's not the same as if I had

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
rotated and then rotated in this direction. See how the

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
object is now tilted? And this is exactly what we're seeing, we're seeing that these

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
rotations, done in the wrong order, mean that now

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you can obviously see that our player is leaning off to the left and he is

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
going to have a tilted view. So this is the problem

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
with the way we are currently doing rotations. We're doing them on the

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
same object, essentially. What we want to do

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is behave in such a way that rotating left and right

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
rotates the whole body, with the shoulders and head and everything OK.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So we rotate to the right. Then,

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
when I look up and down I don't rotate my Body, because that's a bit silly.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If I'm rotating my whole body, I'm leaning forward in order to see.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What I'm actually doing is I'm rotating my Head

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
up and down, so I look down by rotating there.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Now, what that means is, if I go on to rotate my Body

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
again, in any of the directions, my Head

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
hasn't started tilting. So this is essentially what we need to

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
achieve with our camera, by having these two levels where we rotate

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the whole Body and then the second level where we rotate

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
just the Head, or in our case we rotate just the camera.

76
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:08,666
OK time for your challenge! I would like you to

77
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:12,666
create the Camera Gimbal, using the information that we have

78
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,666
about essentially trying to replicate this body movement, about trying

79
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,666
to replicate this person. So I'd like you to use that

80
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,666
structure of our person, and I would like you to...

81
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,666
You will need a parent object to start off with. So like

82
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,666
we have a person parent object, you'll need something like a player parent

83
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,666
object, for example. Then, I'd like you to take the camera and

84
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,666
put it in the place of the head, in the structure,

85
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,666
but obviously in the structure using your new object.

86
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,666
And then, I'd like you to think about the following two questions.

87
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,666
So with mouse X, which object are you going to

88
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,666
rotate? OK, so are you going to rotate the parent or

89
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,666
are you going to rotate the camera, and in which dimension?

90
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:04,666
And then, I'd like you to think about with mouse Y, which

91
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,666
object do you rotate? OK, so answer these two questions and then

92
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,666
share in the discussions, and then, come back to the video and we'll see how we do it.

93
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,666
OK, so pause and have a go at that!

94
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,666
OK welcome back! Let's dive in and have a go at replicating

95
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,666
this layout! So, as I said, first we want a parent object, so I'm going to

96
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,666
right-click in the Hierarchy and Create Empty. And I'm going to go to the

97
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,666
Inspector and rename this, and I'm going to call it our Player,

98
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:36,666
because that's a nice understandable name. Now I said

99
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,666
that we want to put the camera in the same place as the head, so that needs to go underneath

100
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,666
Player. So I'm going to take our Camera and just drag it onto

101
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,666
the Player, and you can see now that goes right underneath our

102
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:52,666
Player location. Perfect! So now,

103
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,666
let's remove the person, let's just Delete that, so that it's

104
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,666
not confusing us anymore. And we've got our Player and obviously

105
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,666
you don't see, particularly, any difference between the Player and the Main Camera, because the Main Camera

106
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,666
is the only thing underneath Player. So , all we need to do now is answer our two

107
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,666
questions. With mouse X which objects do we rotate?

108
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:16,666
OK, so with mouse X we want to rotate

109
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,666
the Body. So left and right and that is going to be

110
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,666
like so, so that is rotating our player left and right.

111
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:28,666
And then, with up and

112
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,666
down, with Y, which we're going to want to rotate our

113
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:36,666
Camera, like so. As you can see, this is keeping

114
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,666
the horizon level in our Camera Preview, that's great! But now, the nice thing is

115
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,666
that we've rotated down, and if I rotate the Player

116
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,666
left and right, then I can go back to the Camera

117
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,666
and I can rotate the Camera up and down again and the

118
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,666
horizon still stays level and we don't get any of that nasty tilting. So

119
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,666
as long as I rotate left and right on the Player and up and down

120
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,666
on the Camera, the result I get is no

121
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:08,666
tilting and exactly the sort of behavior we want. So we've got our

122
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,666
Gimbal, as I'm calling it, our Player rig setup, and in the next lecture,

123
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,666
we're going to look at how we can do this Player rig programmatically.

124
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,200
See you there!
