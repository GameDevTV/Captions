00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.666
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be looking at how we can create spheres and

2
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:14.666
add physics to them, so we can make them collide and do cool things like

3
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.000
this! OK let's dive right in!

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
OK so let's get started by adding a sphere

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
into this scene! So remember that we need to right-click

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in our Hierarchy, then go down to 3D Object, and this is where we've

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
got the list of 3D objects available to us. So

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
let's click on the sphere. Now, if we use

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Alt to rotate around this scene, then we can see

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
where that sphere is located, at the moment, and we can see

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that our floor is a little bit slanty. One thing

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
perhaps of interest is, if you have a

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
look at this widget here, to the right of your viewport,

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
it allows us to look from the different dimensions. So I can look from

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the X dimension, I can look from the Y, dimension, I can look from the Z dimension,

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and you can also look from the opposite sides as well, just by clicking

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
on these elements, essentially.

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And if you click in the middle, it switches from the Perspective view,

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
like this, to an Orthographic view, which is...just

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
makes it easier to see that we're actually rotating this, this plane.

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And let's have a look where our Camera is. So that's where our Camera is,

22
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
this is where our Sphere is, and this is where our

23
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Cube is. I'm going to remove the Rotation from

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that, by... And the way I did that is by going into the Transform,

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in the Inspector, and the Transform is basically about the Position

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and Rotation. So we can see there's Position, here's Rotation,

27
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and then, I'm just going to just use the arrows to adjust the Position. You see as I adjust

28
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the arrows, the position numbers are also changing.

29
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So let's speed that along and I can hit play.

30
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
OK so now we've got the floor underneath us.

31
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Perhaps a little bit too far underneath, so let's

32
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
put it back. OK, now what we want

33
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is that sphere to actually be in front of the camera, because, at the moment, if we look

34
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
at the camera it's over here, and now we can see that the sphere

35
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is in the preview. let's just play to check! There we go, there's

36
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the sphere! A bit boring all being static, at the moment, so what I wanted

37
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to show you in this lecture is something called the RigidBody

38
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Component. So you'll notice, in this Inspector, we've got lots of tabs, so each of these

39
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
tabs is for a different component. We have a Transform component, a Camera

40
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
component, and these are the things that essentially make our object what it is.

41
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So if I look at the Cube, for example, or if I look at the

42
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Sphere, in fact that's what we want to be modifying, you'll notice that there are

43
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
different components that make it a sphere. We have the Transform which tells

44
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
us where that sphere is located, we have the sphere

45
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
mesh itself, (Mesh Filter). I'm not sure

46
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
what that one does, but the Mesh Renderer is the thing that makes it such that

47
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
we can see our sphere in the scene,

48
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and we also have something called a Sphere Collider, we won't worry about. But what I want

49
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to do is add a new component, and what we want to do is

50
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
create some physics on this. So if we look at component

51
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
called Rigidbody... This is what we need, not the 2D

52
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
version but the 3D version. And what this is going to do,

53
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
as we can see by these different fields, is it's going to add some

54
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
mass and some Gravity to our sphere. So let's save that

55
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
scene and hit play.

56
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
There we go! So our sphere just dropped to the ground, without us

57
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.766
having to do anything. Perfect!

58
00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:56.766
So time for your challenge! I would like you go create a second sphere,

59
00:03:56.766 --> 00:04:00.766
using the knowledge that we have just had, and by doing this,

60
00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:04.766
I'd like you to add a sphere to the Hierarchy and then position that

61
00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:08.766
sphere in the viewport. And then, when you've done that with the positioning,

62
00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:12.766
I'd like you to add a Rigidbody component to that sphere, so that it can fall

63
00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:16.766
when you hit play. And make it so that, when you position

64
00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:20.766
them, the spheres actually collide, we can see what kind of

65
00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:24.766
cool effects that's going to have, when spheres actually collide with one another!

66
00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:28.766
Finally, share those results in the discussions! We'd all love to see what

67
00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:32.766
[Laughs] crazy things you manage to do with spheres. Maybe many spheres, maybe cubes as well,

68
00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:36.766
I just want to see what you can concoct out of all these

69
00:04:36.766 --> 00:04:40.766
shapes colliding with one another. OK, so pause the video and let your creativity

70
00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:44.766
run wild!

71
00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:48.766
OK welcome back! We are

72
00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:52.766
going to dive right in! So we

73
00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:56.766
want to create a new sphere! I'm going to right-click, go down to

74
00:04:56.766 --> 00:05:00.766
3D Object again, and Sphere, and as you

75
00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:04.766
can see, it's given the name Sphere (1) because all the names have to be unique.

76
00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:08.766
I'm going to move this sphere and position it, just slightly

77
00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:12.766
underneath but at an offset, so we will get a more interesting collision this way.

78
00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:16.766
I'm going to have a look from the front, maybe I'll offset it slightly in this

79
00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:20.766
dimension, too. Now, as I said, I want to add a component. As you can

80
00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:24.766
see, it still remembers that I had searched for Rigidbody, so I'm going to click that one

81
00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:28.766
and add in a Rigidbody component. OK, I'm going to hit play,

82
00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:32.766
and there we go, the spheres collide and they start to roll off

83
00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.766
in different directions. Now, one thing that I think would

84
00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:40.766
be interesting to play with here is, perhaps if we increase the Mass

85
00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:44.766
of this sphere underneath. So it's going to roll off

86
00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:48.766
much less quickly, because it's heavier.

87
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:52.766
So let's hit that play button! There we go, so

88
00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:56.766
that sphere underneath has definitely rolled much less. Now, what happens if I

89
00:05:56.766 --> 00:06:00.766
invert this? You see, it's very fun! You get to play with physics just right

90
00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:04.766
here on your computer, without having to do much work at all!

91
00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:08.766
Just tweaking a few parameters. There we go, we've got a heavier sphere.

92
00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:12.766
Yep, that is still rolling quite well! OK cool! So that is

93
00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:16.766
your introduction to Rigidbody, and well done on getting that

94
00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:19.666
done!
