00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome! In this video we are going to be

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
reviewing the Game Design Document format. We're also

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
going to be brainstorming concepts, rules, and requirements as

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we go, and we're going to outline the scope for the entire section. So let's

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
dive into this! First off, let's talk a little

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
bit about the concept of this game called Shoot Hoop! We are

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
going to be basically a basketball player in a deserted gym, so

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we don't have to worry about other people or, you know, anything like that. No crazy

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
game mechanics, just a basketball player that's all. And we're going to be shooting

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
as many hoops as possible, in a short span of time.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
OK, so let's drill down a little bit on

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
these rules. What does this actually mean? We're going to have an infinite number of balls that we can

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
throw or we can call these attempts as well.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We are going to lay out a horseshoe configuration for the hoops,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
so that the basketball player is shooting in this one, then this one, and

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so on, just around and around. And we will be

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
scoring a point for every hoop that we shoot,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that we successfully manage to get into the hoop, and

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
we're going to have to limit the time to 1 minute,

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
so we'll be able to see how many, how many I have shot in

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that time. OK, so it's time to pause and

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
have a go at writing the requirements, as you see it. So just a quick

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
reminder! What assets will you need? As some of the prompting questions, what

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
assets will you need? What sound effects? And do you need any

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
artwork? And, as a bonus, see if you can write a No-

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
list as well. OK so pause the video, and have a go at this yourself!

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
OK welcome back! I

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
hope you've had a go, and don't forget to share what you've come up with in the discussions,

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that's always a great way to share with your

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
fellow students and get involved. OK, so let's see,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
let's have a go at the requirements. So what are we going to need? We're going to need a basketball

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
texture, so it's obvious we've got a ball and perhaps it's rotating

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and all that sort of thing. It needs to be obvious that we're

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
shooting a basketball. Then, we need some models for our hoops. So

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Unity does not provide much more than basic things like cubes

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and balls and so on, so we do need to have

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
a model, a mesh that can model our hoop.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We'll need a gym floor texture, because at the moment,

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
very soon, we're going to be putting a gym floor in but it's going to be very bland.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We want to have something that looks a little bit more like a gym.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And we'll need some ball collision sound effects, so when it's hitting

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the backboard, for example, or, you know, going through the hoop we need some sound effects

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
that are equivalent to that. And we might need a splash screen and

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
game over artwork too. OK, so that brings us to the end of the requirements,

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and I'll leave the No List as an exercise to you. Let's see what you

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
come up with in the discussions. OK, see you in the next lecture!
