00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this lecture you are going to be seeing my face, for probably the first

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
time, in the little right-hand corner of the screen, and

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that is because I have this Oculus Rift on my head and I want to show you how

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we are going to be using it to control our game. As you can

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
see, I'm using my gaze to point and shoot these basketballs.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
See you in there! So setting up for the Oculus Rift

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is actually surprisingly easy, so the hardest step will be

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
getting hold of the Oculus SDK. So I'd like you to go ahead and do that first,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
if you haven't already setup your Oculus SDK. Just

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Google for it, go to developer.oculus.com,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and what you're looking for is the PC SDK, that's this one here.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You'll need to obviously agree to various user licensing agreements,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and as of recording, the latest version is 0.8.0.0.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The rest doesn't matter, the important thing is that it's

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
0.8. So you'll be wanting that or higher, basically whatever is the

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
latest. As you can see, I already have it installed. When it's installed, you'll

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
have this Oculus icon in your status bar and there'll be a configuration utility,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and because my Oculus is all plugged in... And

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you can see that I have the Oculus DK 2, obviously not the consumer version because that's not

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
released at the time of recording.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So to actually enable this in our game, it is

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
relatively straight forward. All we have to do is go to the File menu, Build Settings.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now, the platform selected obviously has to be for

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
PC and obviously Mac and Linux Standalone, but PC is the important part.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And we go over to the Player Settings button down here.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, that will open something in our Inspector, so I'm just going to

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
expand the Inspector so we can see it a little bit better, and I can

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
close the Build Settings, at this point. Now, we want to

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
expand the pane called Other

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Settings, and under Other Settings, there is a Virtual Reality

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Supported checkbox here which, if we enable,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Unity does pretty much all the magic for us.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So you need to make sure that your Rift is plugged in

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and the orange LED is switched on

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
here, and then, you simply have to play the game.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It is really that simple! So I'm going to go and start from the menu scene

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and hit play and stick the Rift on my head.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now, in the Rift, you won't see the

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
scene, because it's entirely a UI scene, and UI that doesn't show

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
up in the environment doesn't show up in VR, so that's an important lesson.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So you won't see anything in the Rift, you have to navigate

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
through the computer, at this point, but once we're in the scene, this is

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
entirely, all this movement is being done by my head,

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and again, I can't see anything in the Rift, when the game over

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
screen plays, so we'd have to play again. So I'm going to just extend

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the time of the game a little bit,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
by going to the LevelManager and increasing this number.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And let's hit play!

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
OK,

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and if I click in the game itself, then I'll actually be able to fire

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
using my gaze, which is what I'm doing right now.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
...

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Perfect! So as you can see, converting an

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
existing game to VR is very easy, especially when the camera is already

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
mouse controlled. So we can see the mouse control script

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
here is enabled and that is what is

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
allowing us to look around without the Oculus Rift, and in fact, with

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the Oculus Rift, you still see the mouse has got some effect. But

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
if we don't touch the mouse or if we disable that controller entirely,

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
then it's just the head movement that is effecting it.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And you might notice that, on the

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
camera image, you can actually see some little dots on the Rift.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This doesn't actually appear in real life, this is because my camera's picking up some

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
infrared tracking dots, which are built

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
into the Rift and used for positioning. So your challenge for

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
this lecture is very easy, you need to setup your Rift! I'd

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
like you to download the SDK and install it

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and then check the VR supported setting, as we just did in

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
this video, to see how your game plays when using

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the Rift. And of course, you're going to need to play test your game,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that's the most important step. Check whether everything feels right, and

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
we'll be talking a little bit about how we can fix those UI problems in the

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,300
next lecture. See you there!
