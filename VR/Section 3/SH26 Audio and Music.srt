00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Welcome! In this video we're going to be adding some color to our

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,766
game with sounds! [Game Music Plays]

3
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:17,366
Something like that!

4
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:21,866
So one glaring omission that we currently have with our game

5
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:25,866
is the eerie silence. As you can hear, there is nothing going

6
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:29,866
on. The balls hit the ground and no one is there to hear it.

7
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:33,866
So how do we fix that eerie silence? Well I

8
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:37,866
have handily created another asset pack for you, so we

9
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:41,866
can go ahead and import Custom Package again, and this time get

10
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:45,866
the one called AudioKit. It should be also attached to this

11
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:49,866
lecture! And, as you can see, it's much smaller, it just has a couple of

12
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:53,866
.wav files. Now, these have come

13
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,133
courtesy of

14
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:59,133
Gamemaster Audio. So if we take a look at his

15
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:03,133
website, we have "GameMaster audio",

16
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:07,133
and he sells on this website

17
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:11,133
called Sellfy, which is for, obviously, sound effects, funnily enough.

18
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:15,133
And you can check out his packages, and if the four

19
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:19,133
sounds that I've included aren't enough or you would like to let your creativity run a little

20
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:23,133
bit more wild, then check out Gamemaster Audio a really cool guy doing some really

21
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:27,133
cool sound effects! And you can also find him

22
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:31,133
in the Assets Store for Unity. So we haven't seen the Assets Store before but it's

23
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:35,133
this little tab next to the game, and you can actually drag it out

24
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:39,133
into its own window to make it a little bit bigger, if that tiny amount of

25
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:43,133
space isn't enough for you. And again, you just need to search for "game

26
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:47,133
master audio", and you'll find his audio collection package right

27
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:51,133
here, for sale. So if you feel like shelling out a little bit more money to

28
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:55,133
make your game a little bit more individual and creative, then that is

29
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:59,133
the way to go! OK, so now that we

30
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:03,133
have that audio kit imported, here in the AudioKit folder, you'll notice

31
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:07,133
that there are a few different sounds. So let's start with the most basic way to include

32
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:11,133
audio in a scene and that is audio that auto-plays. So let's go to our

33
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:15,133
main 01_Menu. And we can right-click in our Hierarchy, go to

34
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:19,133
Audio, and then, Audio Source.

35
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:23,133
OK, and now the Audio Source, you'll notice, needs an AudioClip,

36
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,133
so fortunately that's what we've got here in the AudioKit. Now, the one I'm looking

37
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:31,133
for is music_comedy_quirky_fun_knockout.

38
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:35,133
So [Laughs] a funny name but we want that, and we want to drag

39
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:39,133
it onto either the AudioSource or that field, so I just

40
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:43,133
dragged it onto the field. And then, we want to have Play On Awake checked,

41
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:47,133
make sure that's checked, and Loop as well, so the audio just keeps playing

42
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,533
in this particular scene. I'm going to save and preview!

43
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:53,533
[Game Music Plays]

44
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:57,533
Yep, that does indeed

45
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:01,533
seem to be definitely working! So you now know how to add some looping audio into

46
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,266
your game!

47
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,266
Now it's your turn to have a go! I'd like you to add a sound to the game over!

48
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:11,266
So find the sound that makes the most sense in that pack, perhaps even not in the

49
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:15,266
pack, find it wherever you like, go and be creative! And then should

50
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:19,266
it be looping or not? You probably do want it to play on awake, however,

51
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:23,266
and then, add the Audio Source to the game over scene. OK,

52
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:27,266
pause the video and have a go!

53
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:31,266
OK, welcome back! I'm going to go ahead and add this audio now!

54
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:35,266
So in terms of seeing which ones are most appropriate, we can

55
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:39,266
have a little listen here, by clicking on it and hitting the play button. [Chimes Sound]

56
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:43,266
Ooh, that might work! We also have this!

57
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:47,266
[Impact Sound] Probably not. How about this?

58
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:51,266
[Bell Ring] Hmm, unlikely. So I think this one, the game_over_

59
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:55,266
dark_bell_chime [Chimes Sound] might actually be the best thing

60
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:59,266
for our game over screen. So let's go over to the game over screen,

61
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:03,266
and let's add in an

62
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:07,266
Audio Source. And let's add

63
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:11,266
the AudioClip. Now, I could actually click this

64
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:15,266
little icon here, and that brings up all the AudioClips that are

65
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:19,266
around, so I think I'll do that, get the game one

66
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:23,266
and hit save. Now, let's test out this scene!

67
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:27,266
[Chimes Sound] That seems to work!

68
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:31,266
Now, what happens if I hit Loop instead, hit save and Loop?

69
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:35,266
Let's hit play! [Chimes Sound]

70
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:39,266
So it's dying off. [Chimes Sound]

71
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:43,266
OK, we don't want it to be repeating, that just sounds a bit weird. So let's take off the

72
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:47,266
Loop. But it gives us a very clear indication that the game has ended, which is what we

73
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:51,266
were lacking, previously, and it's quite easy to go on playing and accidentally click

74
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:55,266
the play again button. So fantastic, we have added some color

75
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:59,266
and audio to our scenes and our game!

76
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,233
Congratulations! I'll see you in the next video!
