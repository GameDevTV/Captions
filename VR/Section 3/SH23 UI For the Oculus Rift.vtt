00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:10.866
Welcome! In this video we're going to be looking at putting our UI in world space,

2
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.866
so that it is compatible with the Oculus Rift. So you can see that we can look

3
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:18.866
around, we can see it in the Rift, and we're also going to be putting our UI

4
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.866
here, what was a Heads-Up display, also into

5
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.166
our Rift, too. See you in the video!

6
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:30.366
So the first thing I want to do, before we start messing around with anything, is

7
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:34.366
you'll notice if I hit play then it instantly pauses and gives me this error

8
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.366
message in the Console. It says "[VRDevice] Initialization of oculus failed."

9
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:42.366
Now, that is because I no longer have my Oculus Rift plugged in, and

10
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:46.366
for a lot of you that will be the case, too. So to allow you to follow along,

11
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:50.366
let's just go in and disable project settings again.

12
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:54.366
So you go to Build Settings, Player Settings, close this

13
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:58.366
window, go to the bottom, and then, you uncheck Virtual Reality

14
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:02.366
Supported. So now if I hit play, we are back to the game that we

15
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.366
had before! Great! Now, fortunately we can still

16
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:10.366
trial out what I want to do, without the Oculus Rift, but the

17
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:14.366
principles are the same, even if you keep that checked and you'll be able to preview

18
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:18.366
this on your Oculus Rift. So

19
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:22.366
what we need to do is sort out this UI that is not showing up.

20
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:26.366
Now, the reason that the UI doesn't show up is because, the Oculus Rift only shows

21
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:30.366
what the camera shows, so it can't show UI

22
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:34.366
because UI is overlaid after the camera has done its rendering.

23
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:38.366
So what we need to do is put this

24
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:42.366
UI in the environment around us. So

25
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:46.366
I'm going to do that by showing you on the first scene, in fact, on the

26
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:50.366
menu scene, and what we do is we take our Canvas,

27
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:54.366
in the Hierarchy, go over to the Inspector, in the Render Mode we

28
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:58.366
select World Space,

29
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:02.366
and then, if we double-click on our Canvas to position it correctly,

30
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:06.366
...

31
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:10.366
...which I'm doing with a little bit of difficulty. Ah, that's

32
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:14.366
because I'm in the Game Mode, you need to be in C Mode, and if we double-click

33
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:18.366
to position ourselves. There we go, we have our Canvas! And where is that in

34
00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:22.366
relation to our puny little camera? It's very small,

35
00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:26.366
it's right there, so what we need to do is take that Canvas

36
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:30.366
and move it back, and you can actually position with the POS

37
00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:34.366
X and Pos Y in the Inspector. So we want it at 0, 0,

38
00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:38.366
because the reference point is from the center. And now if I look back and

39
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:42.366
perhaps if I position myself behind the camera and zoom out somewhat,

40
00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:46.366
you can see that the camera preview is in fact showing this

41
00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:50.366
scene. So that's great! Let's hit play!

42
00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:54.366
And there we go, you'll see that the scene is all visible

43
00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:58.366
in the VR, and if you were to do this with the Oculus

44
00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:02.366
Rift, you'd be able to look around. We could actually emulate the same effect

45
00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:06.366
by putting a Player Object here instead of our Main Camera. So let's do

46
00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:10.366
that! Let's get the game, save that scene,

47
00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:14.366
let's Copy our Player,

48
00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:18.366
and I'm going to Paste it in here, then just

49
00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:22.366
remove our Main Camera. Now, I'm going to hit play,

50
00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:26.366
and you see, when I look around now, the

51
00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:30.366
UI is actually in the scene itself. So that is perfect, that's

52
00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:34.333
exactly what we want to be achieving!

53
00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:38.333
So it's your turn for a challenge! I'd like you to put the UI in the

54
00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:42.333
game, so in the game scene. Do that by positioning it at a

55
00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:46.333
sensible distance, so it's viewable and still before the clipping

56
00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:50.333
plane of the camera. If you put it too far away, then it won't actually get rendered.

57
00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:54.333
Make it visible when aiming at the targets, so that

58
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:58.333
it won't be a Heads Up Display anymore, it won't move with your head, but, at least,

59
00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:02.333
the player will be able to see the score while they're aiming. And then, you

60
00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:06.333
may need to scale the canvas, in order for it to fit properly

61
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:10.333
in the scene and for the text not to be too ginormous!

62
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:14.333
And then, I'd like you to repeat these steps for the game over

63
00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:18.333
screen; in fact, you might just want to copy over some properties from our splash screen.

64
00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:22.333
OK, so pause the video and have a go at applying your knowledge!

65
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:26.333
Welcome back! I'm going to dive right in

66
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:30.333
and have a go at doing this UI positioning! So I'm going to

67
00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:34.333
save our menu scene, and I'm going to take our Canvas,

68
00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:38.333
go Render Mode, World Space,

69
00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:42.333
there we go, and I'm going to position it at 0, 0,

70
00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:46.333
so that it should be right in front of our camera.

71
00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:50.333
And if I select my camera I should see my little preview, and obviously, this is

72
00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:54.333
in the wrong place because my Canvas is

73
00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:58.333
too far forward. So if I look at it from the side, it is right in front of the camera,

74
00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:02.333
and I want to put it out a little bit in front. Now,

75
00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:06.333
it is, in fact, a ginormous Canvas, so let's

76
00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:10.333
bring that in a bit. And I'm going to do that with the Scale Tool, and remember if I

77
00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:14.333
scale from the middle, there we go, it's bringing it down to a more

78
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:18.333
reasonable size. I'm going to zoom in a little bit more, and

79
00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:22.333
if I look at my Canvas from the front now,

80
00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:26.333
so I can just use that by rotating the little widget, I can

81
00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:30.333
get my UI view, my UI controllers, and

82
00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:34.333
just move the scores into view.

83
00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:38.333
I'm just going to bring them here. I've got to position this one

84
00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:42.333
back towards the top, center-

85
00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:46.333
align it, top-align it rather, and let's save

86
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:50.333
that and preview. Alright,

87
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:54.333
now when I look you see the score is visible where I'm aiming and it's

88
00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:58.333
also at a sensible distance. If you preview this in VR, it will be

89
00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:02.333
fairly comfortable for you to see! OK,

90
00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:06.333
now finally, the last part of the challenge to was to do the game over screen. So

91
00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:10.333
as I said, I'm going to copy mostly the properties that we had

92
00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:14.333
from our Canvas here. So I go into the cog, I go Copy

93
00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:18.333
Component, I go into my GameOverScreen, take the Canvas,

94
00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:22.333
and go to its Rect Transform cog,

95
00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:26.333
and Paste Component Values. But first, I actually

96
00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:30.333
have to enable World Space, otherwise that is not editable. So

97
00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:34.333
I'll Paste Component Values now, and let's see, if I

98
00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:38.333
play, what do I get?

99
00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:42.333
OK, it seems to be in World Space, but let's just check by putting our

100
00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:46.333
Player object in as well.

101
00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:50.333
In fact, because I've copied this Player over a couple of times now, I'm going to make a little prefab

102
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:54.333
out of him. So go into the Prefabs folder, just drag our Player into

103
00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:58.333
the prefab, and then, I want to

104
00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:02.333
go to my _Scenes, Game, and I want to

105
00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:06.333
replace that player there, with my Prefabs Player.

106
00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:10.333
I'll just drag that into the Hierarchy. I'll actually have to put it in the bottom

107
00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:14.333
and Delete the original Player. That's fine because it's identical.

108
00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:18.333
We just play, you'll see how identical it really is,

109
00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:22.333
even though it's a little bit further away, because it's been positioned

110
00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:26.333
slightly differently, but you can sort the position issue out, by just

111
00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:30.333
putting it down to 0, like so.

112
00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:34.333
And now, if we have a look... OK this is

113
00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:38.333
too close, so we'll just put it somewhere in between, around 10,

114
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:42.333
-10, in fact. These are easy positioning

115
00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:46.333
issues, that doesn't matter so much about the

116
00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:50.333
prefab. There we go, so that's more like it! We probably need

117
00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:54.333
to lower it a little bit, too. I'm going to make it 1 meter high instead.

118
00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:02.333
There we go, I think we're back to where we started!

119
00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:06.333
So now, I can use that prefab, instead of copying and pasting

120
00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:10.333
into my GameOver scene. Just remember, prefabs are the sensible way of copying,

121
00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:14.333
because if we ever need to change anything in our Player setup, we only have to do

122
00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:18.333
that in one place and not everywhere. Now, I'll Delete my Main Camera,

123
00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:22.333
hit play, and now, you can see I can

124
00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:26.333
look around, and I can hit play again

125
00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:30.333
and there we go! We have all our

126
00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:34.333
UI now in the game and Oculus Rift compatible!

127
00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:37.233
Congratulations! I'll see you in the next video!
