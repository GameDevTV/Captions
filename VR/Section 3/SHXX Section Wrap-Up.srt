So well done completing that section! I'm with Sam, I think

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:06,433
he's a pretty amazing instructor! And you should be really proud of yourself for

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:10,433
what you've built! So as a recap, Sam, what have they learned? So you've built this

4
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:14,433
awesome shoot the hoop game and you've even previewed it in Oculus,

5
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:18,433
if you have one of those devices. So well done, that is a massive step, and we're really proud!

6
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:22,433
And you've really taken your first step on the ladder with Unity, with C#, with

7
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:26,433
the fundamentals of VR development, you're really coming on a long way. I really encourage you to

8
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,433
share your game, in the discussions, with the other students the best way you can! Screenshots is

9
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:34,433
fine! If you want to take a video and link to a YouTube video, that's even better!

10
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:38,433
So please consider doing that. And while you've got all this momentum

11
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:42,433
behind you and the taste of victory in your mouth, we'd like you to go and

12
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:46,433
plow on with the next section, where we'll be making the Squashy Toad game, a really cool

13
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:50,433
VR game! Absolutely, go dive straight into the next section, keep the

14
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:53,033
momentum! Well done!
