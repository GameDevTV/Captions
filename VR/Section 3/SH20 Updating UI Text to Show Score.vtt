00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:10.966
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be learning about adding text to our

2
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.966
game play overlays, so that we are simultaneously updating

3
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:18.966
them in code, so that we can do things like this to keep score at the top

4
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.966
but also to see how much time is remaining, until game over!

5
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:28.066
So, at the moment, it's not the best experience for our player,

6
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:32.066
that the only time they can see the score is if they

7
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:36.066
go to the logs, and these logs down here don't show up,

8
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:40.066
by the way, when actually publishing your game.

9
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:44.066
So how do we go about getting our

10
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:48.066
score on the screen? So to start off with, let's make our time

11
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:52.066
out a little bit more manageable. Two seconds was great for testing but a little

12
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:56.066
bit insane for actually playing the game, so I'm going to go for about 15 seconds.

13
00:00:56.066 --> 00:01:00.066
It's still very short but just for testing,

14
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:04.066
perhaps this is a little bit more usable, and we can

15
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:08.066
actually see the score increasing now.

16
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:12.066
OK, so what we want to do is create

17
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:16.066
some UI in the main level that

18
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:20.066
allows us to keep track of the score. So how do we go about

19
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:24.066
doing that? Well we start off by

20
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.066
adding in a Canvas and some Text. If I add in some Text, actually,

21
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:32.066
it will add the Canvas for me automatically. Now, mine's

22
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:36.066
already scaled to the right dimensions but if yours isn't, just remember, double-click your Canvas,

23
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:40.066
then zoom in to the right amount. Now,

24
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:44.066
we're going to want to do a UI scale mode and set it to

25
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:48.066
Scale With Screen Size again, on that Canvas.

26
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:52.066
And we actually have two options here about Matching

27
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:56.066
Width or Height. Now, I'm not going to go into any detail about that

28
00:01:56.066 --> 00:02:00.066
just yet. Ah, we'll see for ourselves which one we want.

29
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:04.066
OK, so let's select our Text in the Hierarchy, and I'm going to

30
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:08.066
make this a little bit bigger, and I'm going to

31
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:12.066
select a more appropriate font, as well.

32
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:16.066
We'll go with the font I've been using for everything else. If you want to mix and match

33
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:20.066
fonts go ahead, obviously mixing too many

34
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:24.066
fonts can look a bit tacky. So I'm going to start off with the

35
00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:28.066
score being 0, and I'm going to make it red,

36
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:32.066
because that is what's going to contrast most of the background and I'm

37
00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:36.066
going to position it up here. OK I'm going to hit save,

38
00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:40.066
and let's see that in action! OK, there's our score

39
00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:44.066
in the top corner. Let's just check the different screen dimensions.

40
00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:48.066
OK, so this is where things start to go wrong! If I bring

41
00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:52.066
my screen dimension down, in this way,

42
00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:56.066
then I actually get the text disappearing off

43
00:02:56.066 --> 00:03:00.066
the top of the screen. Now, the reason for that is that the screen

44
00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:04.066
size is being matched, in terms of width, and it's going,

45
00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:08.066
disappearing, off the top. So what we have to do is actually make that

46
00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:12.066
match in terms of Height, and then, you notice it's added in this

47
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:16.066
margin for error, where the Width may come in. That is good, that's what we want!

48
00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:20.066
And we just want to bring our score up to the top of

49
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:24.066
that height. Now, it won't disappear off. Let's just check that!

50
00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:28.066
It won't disappear off, no matter what scale we make it,

51
00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:32.066
because what we adjust, instead, is this margin to the

52
00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:36.066
left, which looks a bit funky on some screen sizes but when we go back

53
00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:40.066
to our normal screen size, maybe we could move it a little bit over. In fact,

54
00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:44.066
I'm just going to do that, make it look a little less weird.

55
00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:48.066
I'll probably put it about there, and let's see!

56
00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:52.066
Yeah, that looks about right! So I think this is

57
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:56.066
going to work on most aspect ratios. If you want to test an exact aspect ratio,

58
00:03:56.066 --> 00:04:00.066
the smallest you're probably going to have to go for is 4:3,

59
00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:04.066
so you want to check that, and obviously, here it has disappeared.

60
00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:08.066
So we do need to bring it in a little bit further than that, on 4:3. Yes,

61
00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:12.066
you see 4:3 doesn't really work, so I'm going to bring it in.

62
00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:16.066
Now if I hit play, it works on

63
00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:20.066
4:3, but if I've got it on Free Aspect, it's also fine.

64
00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:24.066
And I can test out on 16:9,

65
00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:28.066
which is another very common screen resolution. So here we go, that's

66
00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:32.066
all our different screen aspects covered! Now, we

67
00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:36.066
want to update this text in code.

68
00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:40.066
So how are we going to do that? Well I want to create a new script

69
00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:44.066
for this called the Score Display,

70
00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:48.066
and I'll explain why in just a second.

71
00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:52.066
In general, we like to keep our display

72
00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:56.066
code separate from the code which actually stores the values.

73
00:04:56.066 --> 00:05:00.066
So the value for the score is stored in the ScoreKeeper,

74
00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:04.066
and I want the formatting logic, that is the logic that adds

75
00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:08.066
in all the text and connects it up, I want that to be in a different object.

76
00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:12.066
It's just generally a good way to design your code,

77
00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:16.066
is to have data and presentation logic in different

78
00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:20.066
places. So what are we going to have to do? We're going to have

79
00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:24.066
to get hold of our text here and update it, so

80
00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:28.066
let's do that in the following way. I'm going

81
00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:32.066
to create a field that'll hold my text.

82
00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:36.066
Now, if you'll notice there's no text type.

83
00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:40.066
That's because we need to do an import, so we'll create a using

84
00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:44.066
UnityEngine.UI.

85
00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:48.066
So we need to import that, at the top of the file,

86
00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:52.066
just underneath all your other imports, and then we do a Text. Then, I'm going to call it

87
00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:56.066
text, very boringly, and we can get this text by

88
00:05:56.066 --> 00:06:00.066
it doing a GetComponent. So I'm going to add this script, as you might guess,

89
00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:04.066
on the Text itself, so that we can get hold of that

90
00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:08.066
Text component. So let me just show you, the Text of

91
00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:12.066
GameObject has a Text component and that is what we're trying to get hold

92
00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:16.066
of. So I'm going to drag my ScoreDisplay onto that component, so

93
00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:20.066
that GetComponent can do its magic. Now,

94
00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:24.066
with text you have a field, funnily enough, also called text,

95
00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:28.066
which contains the string of text. So I can update

96
00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:32.066
this to do something like "Score:

97
00:06:32.066 --> 00:06:36.066
bla", like so,

98
00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:38.566
and I can hit play.

99
00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:42.566
and you notice that the SCORE text has indeed

100
00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:44.600
been updated.

101
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.600
Your challenge for this lecture is to set the correct score, so

102
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.600
it's no longer just blah! I would like you to use the FindObject

103
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600
OfType method to access your ScoreKeeper, in this script,

104
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.600
and to expose the score as a public variable. By that I mean, in

105
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.600
the ScoreKeeper, you'll need it to be exposed as a public variable, so that you can

106
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.600
get access to it in our Score Display script.

107
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.600
Then, use concatenation, this (+) operator, to update

108
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.600
the score text. So by that I mean to concatenate the

109
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.600
score colon with the actual score value.

110
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.600
And then, finally, when you've done all of that and had success, have a go

111
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.600
at repeating all of those steps, for a time remaining display

112
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.600
script. So one that would be added to a different text field

113
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.600
and show the time remaining in this level. OK, so

114
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.600
pause the video and have a go! OK,

115
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.600
welcome back! I hope you've all had a go at this! It is

116
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.600
sometimes tricky and intimidating, but it really does help,

117
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.600
even if you don't manage to make it all the way through. Just allow yourself 30

118
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.600
minutes, have a play as much as you can, and if you can't get anywhere and get really stuck,

119
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.800
then come back to the video. But do have a go first.

120
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.800
So let's dive right in! The first thing we have to do

121
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.800
is get hold of the ScoreKeeper. So I'm going to create a Score

122
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.800
Keeper variable here, at the top level, so

123
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.800
I'd only have to get hold of it once and not get hold of it in every

124
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.800
Update loop. I should have explained that's why I was doing this with Text, as well.

125
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.800
So we'll do a ScoreKeeper, which is initially empty,

126
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.800
because we need to set it here using the FindObjectOfType.

127
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.800
Obviously the type is ScoreKeeper

128
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.800
and we can save that, and now, we can

129
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.800
try and get hold of our score here. So I said, by concatenation, I'm going to add

130
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.800
on the score, and I'll do scoreKeeper dot.

131
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.800
And you'll notice that there is no score there and that is

132
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.800
because you need to make the score public. So just add public in

133
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.800
front here, which will allow us to access it from anywhere. So

134
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.800
that will do, scoreKeeper.score. And

135
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.800
that should just about do it! So I'm going to go back into Unity

136
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.800
and hit play, and let's just check

137
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.800
what we have here! So

138
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.800
I'll have a little look around, I'll shoot at the targets,

139
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.800
and I'm not actually getting any updates, which is a bit disappointing.

140
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.800
So let's just check that all the scripts are in the right place.

141
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.800
If I go in the Text, ah

142
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.800
for some reason that has not been added in here. Perhaps I didn't save?

143
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.800
And I did just have a crash in between, halfway through this video, so

144
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.800
that shouldn't happen to you guys but it did happen to me. So I'm going to take the

145
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.800
ScoreDisplay, put it on Text, and while I'm at it, I'm going to rename Text to

146
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.800
Score, because that is more semantic and just makes more sense.

147
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.800
So I'll do that. There we go! Now when I hit it

148
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.800
it does, in fact, go up as we would expect. And what if I hit that really far

149
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.800
off target? Yes, it goes up by 3, just as we needed!

150
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.800
And as the time limit runs out, we should go on to the game over screen.

151
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.800
Perfect timing! OK, I'll make sure I hit save,

152
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.800
this time. [Laughs] Don't make the same mistakes I do! Let's copy all of this

153
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.800
for a time remaining text. So I'm going to

154
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.800
Duplicate this object, call it Time

155
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.800
Remaining, like so,

156
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.800
and I'll just put in some filler text. "Time remaining.

157
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.800
3.5"

158
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.800
or something like that. Now, if I use my 2D

159
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.800
tool, I can move this down around

160
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.800
the bottom somewhere, trying to keep it, as much as possible, aligned

161
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.800
with that one at the top. I'm going to

162
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.800
Bottom-Align it, like so. Let's just check that out!

163
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.800
Yep, that looks about right, but because we have the same script,

164
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.800
obviously it is, no matter what the placeholder text is saying,

165
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.800
it actually just gets replaced by exactly the same thing. So that's an

166
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.800
advantage of having this script, you could actually attach it to multiple things and it would

167
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.800
do, in fact, exactly the same thing. So

168
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.800
we want to create a new script, so I'm going to right-click, Create, new C#

169
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.800
Script, and I'm going to call it Time

170
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.800
Remaining

171
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.800
Display. Do excuse my Java notifications.

172
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.800
And let's open that up! And for the most part,

173
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.800
I can copy what we have in our ScoreDisplay,

174
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.800
so I want the UI

175
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.800
up here. Then, I want the Text

176
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.800
in here. Just

177
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.800
make sure I keep my new lines consistent. So just

178
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.800
a reminder, those extra white space lines are there to

179
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.800
basically allow us to see the logical

180
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.800
delimitation between different things. So it's just

181
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.800
an aid to helping the programmer's reading.

182
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.800
And I'll just pop that in there. And obviously, the ScoreKeeper does not exist yet,

183
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.800
and so for that, we need to create a new thing that holds the Level

184
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.800
Manager, because the LevelManager is what has the information we're looking

185
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.800
for, how many seconds are left in the game. Then,

186
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.800
I can set the LevelManager in exactly the same way, doing FindObjectOfType.

187
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.800
Here we go with our LevelManager.

188
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.800
OK. And then, I'll do a levelManager

189
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.800
dot and I want timeTillNext

190
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.800
Level. That is exactly what I want! So here we need to change the text to

191
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.800
"Time remaining: ". And

192
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.800
hopefully that should do the trick. So let's pop back in,

193
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.800
hit play,

194
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.800
and that didn't quite seem to work, because we didn't add in the script.

195
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.800
So I'm going to go remove our ScoreDisplay script

196
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.800
and add in the TimeRemaining script instead.

197
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.800
Let's hit play now and there you go!

198
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.800
We have our time counting down, while our score is

199
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.800
counting up, and so we know how frantically we have to

200
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.800
click, essentially, to get the most points possible before

201
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.800
the time elapses, which it just did and we got the game over!

202
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.800
Perfect! Congratulations on getting this far! Let's move on

203
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.166
to the next video!
