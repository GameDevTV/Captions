00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.900
Welcome! In this lecture we're going to be looking at using cool assets to make our

2
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.900
game actually like like a game of basketball. We're also

3
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.900
going to be doing a little bit of play-testing, to ensure that while it's very

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.900
hard to score these baskets it is not completely impossible.

5
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.900
Even though I might be failing to do it right now, you'll be able to see how

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.333
we can do all of that in the next video.

7
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:33.333
For those of us who aren't actually using an Oculus Rift

8
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.333
to develop the rest of this game, I'm just going to go through and setup these

9
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:41.333
Canvases back to being Overlays,

10
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.333
which is what we were seeing before. If we hit play,

11
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:49.333
then this should give us the desired

12
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.333
behavior, which it does! Perfect! And

13
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:57.333
I'm going to do that for all the other Canvases, throughout

14
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:01.333
our game...

15
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.333
...

16
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.333
...like so.

17
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:13.333
I'll just check a couple of them, I'll hit

18
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:17.333
PLAY AGAIN, and that's now correct again, but I

19
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:21.333
do need to put those back in a good place.

20
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:25.333
So let's zoom in on the Canvas, move our

21
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.333
text around, probably up here,

22
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:33.333
and I'll just check my aspect

23
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:37.333
ratio. In fact, I need to bring that in a little bit

24
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:41.333
and bring this in.

25
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:45.333
And

26
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:49.333
change it to being Bottom-Aligned. Check the

27
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.333
game! That works in that aspect ratio! Free Aspect

28
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:57.333
also works, so I hit save!

29
00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:01.333
So we're back where we started! All we want to achieve

30
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:05.333
now is a bit of a pretty game, so to do that, what we're going to do is import

31
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:09.333
what's called an Asset Bundle. So you go to the Assets menu,

32
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:13.333
go to Import Package, and import Custom Package. Now,

33
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:17.333
there is a package against this lecture, you'll need to download before you can do this, so

34
00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:21.333
if you haven't already got that, pause the video now and download it. But mine's already

35
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:25.333
downloaded, so I'm going to go ahead! And the Asset Pack you're

36
00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:29.333
looking or is called Shoot Hoop Kit. Alright, it's attached to this lecture,

37
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:33.333
so you can just download it from here. So I'm going to open that up, and what'll come up

38
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:37.333
is this Import Unity package dialog, with all these check boxes, prefabs,

39
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:41.333
materials, etc. Now, just leave all the things

40
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:45.333
checked. I've already made this as small an asset

41
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:49.333
pack as can possibly be, so don't uncheck anything.

42
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.333
Now hit Import, and you should get these

43
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:56.966
lovely assets, which have come to us courtesy of

44
00:02:56.966 --> 00:03:00.966
a website called Joongly Games, actually a Russian

45
00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:04.966
studio. Let me just take you to their website! It's spelled like so,

46
00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:08.966
joongly.com. And

47
00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:12.966
the Asset Pack in question is based off this game,

48
00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:16.966
Basketball Shoot Kit, and you can actually find this in

49
00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:20.966
the Unity Assets Store. I'm going to be showing you more about the Assets Store in the next

50
00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.966
lecture. But it's quite a cool game in it's own right! You can actually try it

51
00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:28.966
out here, there's a WEB DEMO, so I do recommend that. And you can also find the link to

52
00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:32.966
this in the lecture notes, again. OK so let's

53
00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:36.966
go back in! Hopefully our import is done now

54
00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:40.966
and we have our Shoot Hoot... Shoot Hoop, Shoot Hoop. It says Shoot Hoot,

55
00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:44.966
actually, but for yours that spelling mistake will hopefully be

56
00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:48.966
corrected. So what you have in the Shoot Hoop kit

57
00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:52.966
is the ball and RingBoard, and these are two

58
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:56.966
assets, which we are going to import into our scene. So I'm going to just

59
00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:00.966
double-click on the Ground, so

60
00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:04.966
that we have that kind of level of scale, and I'm going to

61
00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:08.966
drag in our RingBoard into our Hierarchy,

62
00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:12.966
which is, as you see, has pretty much positioned itself quite well in the scene.

63
00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:16.966
So if I look from above, and I'll need

64
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:20.966
to do the Rotation Tool to bring this around.

65
00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:24.966
There we go! And I'll just

66
00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:28.966
reposition it, now, in front of

67
00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:32.966
our Player. Let's take a look at what this looks like!

68
00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:36.966
There we go! So we have

69
00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:40.966
this nice Ring Board, which even has some little bits of

70
00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:44.966
cool animation on it, so that if we fire at it,

71
00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:48.966
we get the net bouncing around

72
00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:52.966
and the Ring Board bouncing back. So that is really nice, actually, it looks

73
00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:56.966
pretty cool and makes our game just look that little bit more polished!

74
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.500
So it's your turn again! I'd like you to build a level from the assets in this

75
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
Asset Pack. So I'd like you to duplicate the RingBoard prefab,

76
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.500
around your level. You would need to position it around, scale it, rotate

77
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.500
it, whatever you want to do, just get creative! Remove the unecessary

78
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.500
blocks in the scene, because we don't need those anymore now that we have this cool RingBoard!

79
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.500
And then, replace the ball that gets shot, with

80
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.500
that cool one that is included in the Asset Pack, that actually looks like a basketball.

81
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.500
OK, pause the video, and let your creativity run wild!

82
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.500
OK, welcome back! I'm going to dive right in

83
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.500
and let my own creativity run wild! So let's go to the RingBoard, and

84
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.500
first off, as I said, I'm going to be duplicating this a couple of times to

85
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.500
create our different rings. And let's position

86
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.500
these off to the side, so RingBoard (1) over here

87
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.500
to here, and I think I'm going to bring them around in a bit of an arc,

88
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.500
in fact, because otherwise this is going to be really hard to play if

89
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500
I don't bring them around at all. And so,

90
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.500
as a result I'm going to have to, oops, rotate them

91
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.500
around something a little bit like this

92
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.500
is what I'm thinking of. So I want to rotate that like

93
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.500
that, I'm going to move it

94
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.500
in line. That seems about

95
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.500
right to me! And then, our third one, I'm just going to bring

96
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.500
along, rotate it a little bit.

97
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.500
And I'm not going to do all of them, that would spoil the fun

98
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.500
for you guys, so I'll let you do your own creative

99
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.500
work. So let's just preview that scene!

100
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.500
Right now, we're surrounded by our Ring Boards,

101
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.500
which is exactly what we wanted! And we have to try and shoot our own

102
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.500
baskets, so how do we do that? Trickily is the answer to

103
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.500
that! There we go, I might just about be

104
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.500
able to get one in, but it's pretty pretty tough so this may require

105
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.500
some play-testing to get the directions all correct.

106
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.500
So the next challenge was to make the Player

107
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.500
spawn a basketball that is actually this ball.

108
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.500
So I'm going to drag that ball, simply, into the Ball Prefab, and that's

109
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.500
how easy it is, because we left that exposable to

110
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.500
the level designer in fact. As a programmer,

111
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.500
we expose that to the level designer. So let's hit play and now see

112
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.500
what ball gets generated! OK, this is pretty cool! Now we're actually

113
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
playing basketball! And you'll notice this ball has a bit more

114
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.500
bounce to it, it's a little bit more springy, and that is actually

115
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.500
making this pretty impossible to play, at the moment.

116
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.500
We'll need to do some work to adjust that, so

117
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.500
let's try and do some play-adjusting! The way I'm going to do that is

118
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.500
simply by bringing down our Ball Speed, because I think we are basically

119
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.500
launching it with a lot more velocity and force than

120
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.500
a basketball should be launched. So let's

121
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.500
try that out! Right now, you see it's struggling to quite

122
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.500
reach the target, so I think we need somewhere in between the two,

123
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.500
perhaps around 15.

124
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500
Let's save and play,

125
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.500
and let's have a go now! OK, this

126
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.500
might be better, although it is quite hard still. [Laughs]

127
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.500
I might need to aim... There we go! Ooh ooh, very

128
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.500
close! Nearly! No, if it bounces off the ring,

129
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.500
it doesn't quite make it in, so we may have to just make these a little bit

130
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.500
shorter or our Player just a bit taller. But as you can see, this

131
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.500
is really just a matter of play-testing, at this stage, so I'm going to make my

132
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.500
Player a bit taller and see if that helps me out.

133
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.500
After all, basketball players do tend to be very tall individuals.

134
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.500
Let's see, if I aim to the backboard...

135
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.500
No, still not quite working!

136
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500
It does

137
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.500
look like I need a little bit less force, so let's bring

138
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.500
down this, to about 12 instead.

139
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.500
This does look more promising. There we

140
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.500
go! We were able to score a basket, but it's still a very hard game, so you'll have to

141
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.500
tweak these parameters and possibly reposition your

142
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.500
board so that scoring baskets is a little bit easier than that.

143
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.500
OK, the next level will be looking at how we can actually reintroduce

144
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.466
these scores!
