00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:11,166
Welcome! In this lecture we are looking at how we can keep track of that

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:15,166
score between levels, so that when I have a game over,

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,166
it will actually print how badly [Laughs] I did in those 5 seconds

4
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:23,166
of game. So let's dive right into that!

5
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:28,066
So our score shows up just fine when

6
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:32,066
we are playing, and that is great to give the user the feedback

7
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:36,066
as they're going along, to see how well they're doing, how much time is

8
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:40,066
left, etc. However, what happens when we get to our game over screen

9
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:44,066
is that, suddenly that score information is completely not visible,

10
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:48,066
in fact, it's completely lost. So if I just minimize this game

11
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:52,066
and have a look, the object in the Hierarchy,

12
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:56,066
none of them is the ScoreKeeper.

13
00:00:56,066 --> 00:01:00,066
ScoreKeeper has actually been destroyed, and this is a common thing in Unity.

14
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:04,066
What happens is all these objects, when we switch to a new

15
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:08,066
level, are destroyed to make way for the new objects in

16
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:12,066
other levels, so all these new objects replace

17
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:16,066
those objects that were there before. But there is a way of

18
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:20,066
preventing that. So if we want to get hold of say the ScoreKeeper's

19
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:24,066
score, in the GameOver scene, we

20
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:28,066
would have to do the following. So I'm going to open up my Score

21
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:32,066
Keeper, that's this one here. And what I have to do is, in the

22
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:36,066
Start () method I need to call a method called DontDestroyOnLoad.

23
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:40,066
Now, what does it take? It takes an object! In fact, it takes the game

24
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,066
object that this ScoreKeeper is attached to.

25
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:48,066
Now, we can get hold of that very easily, just with (gameObject);

26
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:52,066
(gameObject) is a field on ScoreKeeper. In fact, it's implemented

27
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:56,066
in this class, MonoBehavior. So remember

28
00:01:56,066 --> 00:02:00,066
with a class, what we're saying here is that we've got a ScoreKeeper type,

29
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:04,066
which is a MonoBehavior. MonoBehavior has a lot

30
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:08,066
of stuff implemented already, for us, including this calling to

31
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:12,066
Start (), Update (), and having a (gameObject)

32
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:16,066
field. So that is what we're going to use, we're going to do DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject).

33
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:20,066
Now, I'm going to hit save and let's hit play!

34
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:24,066
From here, I'm going to just reduce first the time out in full,

35
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:28,066
so that we can test a little bit more easily, back down to 2 seconds.

36
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:32,066
And let's hit play

37
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:36,066
and we move straight on! Now, I'm going to minimize this again,

38
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:40,066
and notice that, this time, we have the ScoreKeeper object!

39
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:44,066
Now, I didn't add that in. We can verify that, just go over

40
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:48,066
to GameOver, and there's no ScoreKeeper object here. So what

41
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:52,066
actually happened is, that ScoreKeeper object, thanks to the DontDestroyOnLoad,

42
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:56,066
has actually persisted between the two scenes.

43
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:00,066
OK, so that's all very well! But what happens if we

44
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:04,066
play again! We're going to get an accumulation of ScoreKeepers. Let me show you that!

45
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:08,066
So I'll just minimize this.

46
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:12,066
And there we go, we've got our first ScoreKeeper! Now, if I play again,

47
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:16,066
we want ScoreKeeper and ScoreKeeper, and we've got ScoreKeeper and ScoreKeeper.

48
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:20,066
And I just keep playing and I get more and more ScoreKeepers!

49
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:24,066
So how do we

50
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:28,066
absorb these ScoreKeepers, when we get into game

51
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:32,066
over? Well the way I'm going to do that is by writing an

52
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:36,066
absorb script! So let's right-click, Create, C# Script,

53
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:40,066
and I will call it ScoreAbsorber,

54
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:44,066
because it absorbs the score

55
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:48,066
from the other scene. So the way we're

56
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:52,066
going to implement this is, first off, we want to find the

57
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:56,066
ScoreKeeper. So I'm going to do ScoreKeeper,

58
00:03:56,066 --> 00:04:00,066
just call it oldKeeper,

59
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:04,066
and we'll do a FindObjectOfType ScoreKeeper,

60
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:08,066
like so.

61
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:12,066
And then, what do we want to do? Well we want to

62
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:16,066
grab hold of the score in here, so I'm going to do a public

63
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:20,066
int, because I'm going to want to get this in the UI, public

64
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:24,066
int score. Now, we can set our

65
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:28,066
score from the oldKeeper,

66
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:32,066
like so. And finally, we call Destroy

67
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:36,066
on the (oldKeeper.gameObject). So see

68
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:40,066
what I meant, when I said that that was a field of ScoreKeeper?

69
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:44,066
When, in the ScoreKeeper, we

70
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:48,066
said (gameObject), I could well have said (this.gameObject),

71
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:52,066
this being the object, the instance, that we're

72
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:56,066
currently in, that would have been exactly the same thing, but I can just

73
00:04:56,066 --> 00:05:00,066
remove that and say (gameObject) instead. So

74
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,066
here we are in the ScoreKeeper! We've just destroyed the old game

75
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:08,066
Object, so we have absorbed that score in essence.

76
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:12,066
Now, I'll just tidy up my new lines,

77
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:16,066
and let's put that ScoreKeeper into

78
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:20,066
our scene, our GameOver scene.

79
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:24,066
So I'm going to right-click, Create an Empty object, call it the

80
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:28,066
ScoreAbsorber,

81
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:32,066
and drag the script onto it.

82
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:36,066
Now, if we try running from our game over

83
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:40,066
screen, we're going to get an error, and the reason for that error is

84
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:44,066
because there is no ScoreKeeper. When we do this FindObjectOf

85
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:48,066
Type, there is no ScoreKeeper currently in the scene, because it has to come over

86
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:52,066
from the previous scene, here in Game. So I'm going to

87
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:56,066
Save this one. I'll go to the main Game, just to check what

88
00:05:56,066 --> 00:06:00,066
I'm saying, we let it to go through, and now, it's fine! There's

89
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:04,066
no errors there, so if I un-maximize you'll see

90
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:08,066
what I mean. No errors whatsoever! So what we can do

91
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:12,066
to minimize these errors is, give the score a default value,

92
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:16,066
give it a default value of 1, and say that if

93
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:20,066
oldKeeper. What this means is, if we manage

94
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:24,066
to find the (oldKeeper), because if this was

95
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:28,066
null, so if this doesn't return anything, then

96
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:32,066
this will evaluate a false. So we can cut the

97
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:36,066
contents of this, and we only access what is in

98
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:40,066
the (oldKeeper), if we managed to find it. That

99
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,066
just kind of wraps our code in a little layer of safety.

100
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:48,066
So if I go to my game over screen and hit play, now I don't

101
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:52,066
have it crashing but I won't have the score object in

102
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,966
here either.

103
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:57,966
So here is a bit of a De Ja Vu challenge for you! I would like you

104
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:01,966
to display the score now, on the Game Over screen. So take that

105
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:05,966
knowledge, that you used in the previous lecture, and create a new GameOver

106
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:09,966
ScoreDisplay component. Ooh, that was a bit of a mouth full!

107
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:13,966
And you're going to need to put this on the relevant text

108
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,966
item, and find the ScoreAbsorber and update the

109
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:21,966
text. So you should be, pretty much, following the same pattern as in the

110
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,966
previous lecture. If you're a bit unsure, go back and have a look at the video,

111
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:29,966
for that. OK, pause and have a go!

112
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,966
Welcome back! I'm going to dive right in and

113
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:37,966
attempt this challenge! So let's go into the Assets.

114
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:41,966
Scripts, I'm going to create that new script, a mouth full script.

115
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:45,966
The GameOver

116
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,966
Score, if I can spell it, ScoreDisplay.

117
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:53,966
So this has to be a different component, because we're going to be accessing the ScoreAbsorber

118
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:57,966
instead of the ScoreKeeper. So I'm going to take that, and I'm going to

119
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:01,966
add a new piece of text here. In fact,

120
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:05,966
I'm going to not reinvent the wheel but copy over that text,

121
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:09,966
which already had all the formatting correct, from here, from

122
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:13,966
our main game, and paste it in here

123
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:17,966
to our game over screen. So I'll stick it under

124
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:21,966
the Canvas, I'm going to move it into the correct position

125
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:25,966
around the center, I think, and center it in both

126
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:29,966
dimensions and increase the Font Size.

127
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:33,966
Oh, I might need to increase the box size, too. So I'm going to increase the

128
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:37,966
font to be more on par with what else is on the screen.

129
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:41,966
There, I have the score! I just need to remove the Score Display Component,

130
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:45,966
because we want to add our new component instead. So I go to Scripts

131
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:49,966
and drag in the GameOver Score Component, onto the Text item.

132
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:53,966
Excellent! Now, if I open

133
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,966
up that script, it should be fairly blank,

134
00:08:57,966 --> 00:09:01,966
which it is. So what I'm going to do is, I'm actually going to copy over

135
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:05,966
the body from the ScoreDisplay, because it's

136
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:09,966
actually pretty much identical, in terms of it's functionality.

137
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,966
So I'm just going to copy and paste and replace those Update () and Start () methods.

138
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:17,966
Now, it's complaining about Text, because I haven't copied over

139
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:21,966
this Using, from the top, so I'm going to copy that over, too.

140
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:25,966
Notice I didn't copy the whole file, because obviously the class

141
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,966
name is different. It's important that the class name is different,

142
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:33,966
otherwise things would break! Now, we're not getting hold of the ScoreKeeper anymore.

143
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:37,966
What we want to be getting hold of is our ScoreAbsorber, this

144
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:41,966
one here. It's obvious that's going to break the type of this, so

145
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:45,966
we need to update that, too! And while this isn't a type

146
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:49,966
problem with our scoreKeeper, I don't like the fact that it's no longer a

147
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:53,966
scoreKeeper, so if we right-click on it, hit Rename, then we should be able

148
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:57,966
to do scoreAbsorber, and hit a Apply

149
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:01,966
and there we go! Now, that is

150
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:05,966
correctly spelled, everything's looking good,

151
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:09,966
and if we hit play on our game over screen, what we should see is a score

152
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:13,966
of 1, because remember the default was set to 1. However, if we come into

153
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:17,966
the game... Oops, I pulled up my Start Menu!

154
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:21,966
If we come into the game from our previous scene, we should actually get

155
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:25,966
the real score, so the score that was scored.

156
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:29,966
In this case, it was 1. Let's try and score 0!

157
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:33,966
And 0! And let's try and score a few more than this!

158
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,966
Ah, there we go, I managed to score

159
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,966
3! [Laughs] In 2 seconds it's hard to score very many, but you

160
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:45,966
can score something and the game remembers! So success,

161
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:49,966
we have got a score printing on our game over screen!

162
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:53,700
Well done! Let's move on to the next lecture!
