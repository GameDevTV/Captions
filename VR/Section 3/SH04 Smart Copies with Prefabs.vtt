00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:10.533
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be adding materials to these

2
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.533
balls, so that we actually give them some color. And we're also going to be learning

3
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:18.533
how to make linked copies, so all of these are made from the same linked copy,

4
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.533
and editing a property of just one of them will edit

5
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.333
the properties of all of them.

6
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:29.333
So I want to show you how we can add a little bit of color into

7
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:33.333
our lives, I mean our scenes. I want to

8
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.333
change the color of this sphere. Now, if we click

9
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:41.333
on the Sphere and have a look at the Inspector, you'll notice there isn't anything talking

10
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.333
about color except down here, this default material. So

11
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:49.333
perhaps that's an indication that we want to actually do something with the material, but we

12
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.333
can't edit it, at the moment, and I'll show you why. You need to create a new material.

13
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:57.333
So let's right-click in the Assets folder, go to Create,

14
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:01.333
Folder. So I'm going to create a folder to hold all

15
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.333
our materials, and, very intriguingly, [Laughs] I'm going

16
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.333
to call it Materials, and then, I'm going to right-click and Create a new Material.

17
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:13.333
So right-click, Create again, and this time, Material is what we want.

18
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:17.333
And I'm just going to call it Basket

19
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:21.333
Ball. So that's the BasketBall material, and,

20
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:25.333
for now, we are just going to click in the Inspector, so when you

21
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.333
have... Let's just go back a second. Click on the BasketBall material, go to the

22
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:33.333
Inspector, and you'll see that there is now an Albedo

23
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:37.333
thing here. Now what you want to click in on the color of the Albedo, so that's white

24
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:41.333
at the moment, and then, we can change it, using this Color Picker, to

25
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:45.333
whatever kind of obnoxious basketball color we want. I'm going to go for violet,

26
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:49.333
like so. And then, this...we need to associate

27
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.333
this material with our sphere, and we do that very much like we did with the script,

28
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:57.333
we just drop it onto the Sphere that we want the color of.

29
00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:01.333
OK, so you notice obviously this only updates the Sphere, this one

30
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:05.333
sphere, and I'm going to call this Sphere BasketBall, by renaming

31
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:09.333
it in the Inspector. Remember to hit Enter, because otherwise the name won't go through.

32
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:13.333
So we've got this one BasketBall, but otherwise, we'd have to go through and update the Sphere.

33
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:17.333
But what happens if I've got another sphere in this scene? You know, what if I've

34
00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:21.333
got four spheres? And it can just go on and on.

35
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:25.333
Maybe I've got loads and loads of spheres, and we will have, you know, infinite basketballs,

36
00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:29.333
so we can't just update everything manually. So let's get rid of these

37
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:33.333
Spheres. I'm going to select them and then Delete.

38
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:37.333
And what we can do is use something that Unity calls a prefab. So I'm

39
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:41.333
going to Create a new Folder for these so called prefabs, before

40
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:45.333
I tell you what they are. So in these, what we can do

41
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:49.333
is essentially drag an object, from our Hierarchy, into a folder,

42
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.333
and this creates a new object called a prefab, which is essentially a

43
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:57.333
template for creating new BasketBalls. So

44
00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:01.333
if you click on it, you see down here it says the name of the file, Basket

45
00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:05.333
Prefab...Basketball Prefab. And if you look

46
00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:09.333
in the Inspector, it tells you all the properties of this prefabbed object. We can see that it has the

47
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:13.333
Rigidbody, it also has the BasketBall color. So now, if I drop

48
00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:17.333
these into the scene, and let's move them around so that we can

49
00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:21.333
actually see where they are. I drop

50
00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:25.333
multiple ones in the scene. You see they all have these properties. OK,

51
00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:29.333
well this is all very well and good, so we can put

52
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:33.333
more of the same thing in the scene and just have a few properties

53
00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:37.333
out. But the real power that comes with the prefabs

54
00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:41.333
is being able to edit this prefab directly. So,

55
00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:45.333
for example, if I went in and I

56
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:49.333
changed what text.. what material I was using,

57
00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:53.333
so I could change to using a different color perhaps,

58
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:57.333
down here, and suddenly everything is changed,

59
00:03:57.333 --> 00:04:01.333
all of them are changed at once.

60
00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:05.333
I could disable one of them from using Gravity,

61
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:09.333
and you can see that it's in bold, when I've disabled it here, because it's no

62
00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:13.333
longer linked with the prefab. But if I edited that on

63
00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:17.333
the prefab itself, like so, and then, I go back to

64
00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:21.333
the BasketBalls, you'll notice that now none of them

65
00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:25.333
uses Gravity. And if we hit

66
00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:29.333
play we can ensure that, we can check. There you go, none of them are using Gravity!

67
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:33.333
So if I click on the prefab again and

68
00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:37.333
enable Gravity, then there's just that one

69
00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:41.333
ball, which I had over-ridden, that isn't using Gravity.

70
00:04:41.466 --> 00:04:45.466
Time for your challenge! I'd like you to change the angular

71
00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:49.466
friction of these balls. So what do I mean by that? Let's just have

72
00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:53.466
a little quick look! The Angular Friction or the Angular Drag

73
00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:57.466
is this property here, on the Rigidbody. It basically means

74
00:04:57.466 --> 00:05:01.466
how much drag do we have on the ball rotating. OK,

75
00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:05.466
so change the angular friction. Make a high angular friction for

76
00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:09.466
just one ball and see what effect it has, when you preview the effect.

77
00:05:09.466 --> 00:05:13.466
Then, make it the same for all the balls in the prefab.

78
00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:17.466
What happens? I'd be interesting to see! Share your results in

79
00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:21.466
the discussions. OK pause the video and have a go!

80
00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:25.466
OK welcome back! Let's have a go at

81
00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:29.466
doing this assignment! So the first thing I want to do is

82
00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:33.466
re-enable Gravity, so that we are back on the prefab essentially.

83
00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.466
I can right-click this and do Revert Value

84
00:05:37.466 --> 00:05:41.466
to Prefab, so that is what I'm going to do.

85
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.466
Now what am I going to do? I'm just going to change the Angular Drag for

86
00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:49.466
one of these balls. Which one would be most interesting? I think the one in the center, and that's

87
00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:53.466
at a really ridiculously high Angular Drag like 300.

88
00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:57.466
There we go! And now if we hit play, let's see what happens

89
00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:01.466
with that. Yeah, so it absolutely doesn't

90
00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:05.466
move, but what would be more interesting is the angular drag of these balls on the outside,

91
00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:09.466
like this one, so let's put that one really high.

92
00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:13.466
Let's hit play!

93
00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:17.466
So you see, it's not moving anywhere because it can't roll;

94
00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:21.466
it gets a lot of Angular Drag, a little rotational drag, it's also

95
00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:25.466
called. So let's just revert these back to our prefab values.

96
00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:29.466
Go and select the center ball, as well,

97
00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:33.466
Revert to Prefab Value. Now, if we click on our prefab

98
00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:37.466
itself, we can change all of them, at once, to being 300.

99
00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:41.466
So I'm going to have a look, hit play,

100
00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:45.466
and suddenly, these balls aren't going anywhere,

101
00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:49.466
except this one on the outside, which I think I haven't reverted properly.

102
00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:53.466
Revert Value to Prefab. OK, so

103
00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:57.466
we successfully changed all the properitees at once,

104
00:06:57.466 --> 00:07:01.466
just by editing the prefab. Now you can start to see the power

105
00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:04.533
of using the Unity Editor! See you in the next lecture!
