Hi, so 2016 is finally the year that

2
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:10.266
Virtual Reality is taking off, and we want to show you how to make real apps

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:14.266
using Unity, even if you don't have any experience. My name is Ben, I'm one of

4
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:18.266
Udemy's top instructors, and I'm Sam, I'm a software engineer and a university

5
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:22.266
supervisor. So, why are we the best people to teach you this fascinating content?

6
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:26.266
So Ben is, as he said, one of the top instructors on Udemy, and he

7
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:30.266
is the mastermind behind some of the top game development courses.

8
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:34.266
He has over 100,000 different students, and 7,000

9
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:38.266
5 star reviews! Thanks very much Sam! And I've chosen to team up

10
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.266
with Sam for this one, because Sam is a double first computer science graduate

11
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:46.266
from Cambridge University. He really knows his stuff and he is the ideal guy

12
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:50.266
to make this complex world of VR development really simple for you guys.

13
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.266
So, the general design of the course is that you start off not needing

14
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:58.266
anything, not even Unity, you're just going to learn C# that's right. From there you're going to go

15
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:02.266
on to use Unity for the first time, and you won't need any

16
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:06.266
hardware. Hardware is optional for that section. Then, you go on to only

17
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.266
need a Google Cardboard, which costs you just $20, and throughout

18
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:14.266
the entire course, having an Oculus Rift is optional! That's correct! So the first

19
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:18.266
actual learning section, Sam, what's that? So that is a game called Go

20
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:22.266
Home. You'll be creating this game from scratch, and it will teach you the basics of programming

21
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:26.266
as well as some basic vector arithmetic, which will be very important

22
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:30.266
in VR. So that, if you're a complete beginner, will really set you on the right tracks.

23
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:34.266
Moving on from there, we've got Shoot Hoop. Now, this is where you meet Unity an amazingly

24
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:38.266
powerful and free game engine, for the first time, and you make a game that is going to be

25
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:42.266
ideal for Oculus Rift, it's going to allow you to shoot into hoops,

26
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:46.266
from this rapid like Whack A Mole perspective. It's loads of fun,

27
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:50.266
It's complete, it's got a menu system, it's got sound effects, and it's a really

28
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:54.266
cool game! Hardware is completely optional for it! And in section 4

29
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:58.266
what will they be learning Sam? So that is when we are going to introduce you to the

30
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:02.266
Mobile forms of VR, with the Google Cardboard SDK and also

31
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:06.266
the Gear VR, Samsung's introduction to the mobile platforms, and

32
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:10.266
it's with a game called Squashy Toad, which is a clone

33
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:14.266
of Crossy Road. Yeah, so there's procedural generation of terrain and all

34
00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:18.266
sorts of stuff in there. And you can take the knowledge you learned about Cardboard development and use it

35
00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:22.266
in the previous section. So, 2016's the year to get ahead

36
00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:26.266
of the game, by learning how to program VR apps, so please join us

37
00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.300
on the course now!
