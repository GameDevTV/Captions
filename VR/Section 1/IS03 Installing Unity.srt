00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:10,166
Welcome! In this lecture we are going to be installing Unity! That's this

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,166
beauty here. We're going to be opening the Editor for the first time and

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:18,166
learning how to play in the Editor and also installing Visual Studio

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:21,433
too, as a side effect. So, let's get stuck right in!

5
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:25,433
So, let's get started with installing Unity!

6
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:29,433
Let's get stuck in. Let's open Google Chrome, and I just

7
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:33,433
want to, before we start, give you a cautionary tale about

8
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:37,433
versions. So, here I'm using Windows 10; that shouldn't

9
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:41,433
matter too much, you could probably do it all the way down to Windows 7, but why would you want to

10
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:45,433
when Windows 10 is so cool. Or you can do it on

11
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:49,433
OSX, both platforms should have pretty much exactly the same

12
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:53,433
setup process. So, you can follow this video for both Windows and

13
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:57,433
OSX. Now, the thing I do want you to be careful about though is that you get the right

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,433
version of Unity, because it's going be new software, you might not be familiar

15
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:05,433
with it, so it's very important that we have exactly the same setup

16
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:09,433
as what you see in my videos so there's no confusion

17
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:13,433
around different versions. So, the important thing to be looking for

18
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:17,433
is Unity 5.3. That's the version we're

19
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:21,433
using, and you'll notice that if I search for 5.3, we've got all

20
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,433
this. Now, what we actually want is

21
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:29,433
"Unity 5.3 archive download".

22
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:33,433
And now, this is going to bring us to a spacial page on the Unity

23
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:37,433
3D website, where they have the archives

24
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:41,433
of all the previous versions of Unity. So, you can see, you could go all the way back to

25
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:45,433
version 3 point something, 4 point something, and we are using

26
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:49,433
5.3. Now, you'll notice that the versions are

27
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:53,433
actually three digits long, 5.3.4

28
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:57,433
or 5.3.2. Now, this doesn't matter

29
00:01:57,433 --> 00:02:01,433
so much, the last decimal point doesn't matter. So, just get the latest of

30
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:05,433
these decimal points, as long as these bits are 5.3. So, Unity

31
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:09,433
5.3 is what we're looking for. Now, they've got an interesting

32
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:13,433
system here with drop-down menus, so if you're using a Mac you'll want to drop-

33
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,433
down from this menu. If you're using Windows drop-down from here, and what we actually

34
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:21,433
want to select here is the Unity Installer itself. So, click on

35
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,433
that and that will just download

36
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:29,433
a little small installer here, which we can run.

37
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:33,433
Give it permissions. OK, so now

38
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,666
we're in the Download Assistant.

39
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,666
So, it's your turn to check or install your environment.

40
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,666
I'm leaving this as a challenge for you to do. I will show you later how

41
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:47,666
I do the particulars, just in case you do get stuck, but hopefully

42
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,666
you'll manage to install this by yourselves. So,

43
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,666
I'd like you to check, so by that I mean if you've already got

44
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,666
Unity then I want you to check it's Unity 5.3; if not, finish downloading

45
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,666
Unity 5.3. Then, I'd like you to install

46
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,666
Unity using the default components. That just means going through that installer

47
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,666
and leaving the default check boxes. Then, I

48
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,666
want you to find out, while that's downloading and finishing off the installation

49
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,666
process, I would like you to find out which VR games are actually

50
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,666
made in Unity, i.e. you doing relevant Google searches,

51
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,666
sharing in the discussions the ones that you think look most intriguing,

52
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,666
and that you would like to take inspiration from. So, go and get inspired,

53
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,666
and then, when it's finished, I'd like you to launch the Unity Editor

54
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,666
and try and run, see what that does. Try and see how you

55
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:43,666
can run in the Unity Editor. OK, so pause the video

56
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,666
and go and have a go at this challenge.

57
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,666
OK, welcome back! I hope you've all had a go at installing it for yourself.

58
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,966
If you're stuck, let's dive in and have a go with me.

59
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:58,966
OK, so fairly easy. We need to step through

60
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:02,966
this installer. Now, these are the components I was talking about.

61
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:06,966
For now, we're going to leave them all checked. Later on, we will want some more of these, but

62
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:10,966
we can always come back and add more later, so there's no

63
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:14,966
need to do that right now. I'm going to just go through leaving

64
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:18,966
all the default locations as they are. We need to

65
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,966
accept the terms and conditions on Visual Studio, if you're on Windows;

66
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:26,966
otherwise, on Mac you won't need to do this, it will

67
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,966
install MonoDevelop for you instead. So, let's just go through!

68
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:34,966
That's the only difference between Mac and Windows, so we'll be seeing

69
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:38,966
how that differs later on in the course. But no need to worry, it is

70
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:42,966
pretty much identical otherwise. Just the thing that you edit, the code

71
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:46,966
bin will look slightly different. OK, now

72
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:50,966
we have to leave this downloading and doing the install. It's all

73
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:54,966
fairly autonomous, so we don't have to press any buttons really past this point,

74
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:58,366
which is great very easy install procedure.

75
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:02,533
So, like I said, I would like you to do a little bit of research about

76
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:06,533
Unity VR games and see which ones you might use as

77
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:10,533
inspiration. So, first port of call, let's just search for Unity

78
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:14,533
VR, and now, there's a few interesting links

79
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,533
here. These ones are from the documentations but might not be too helpful for you right now.

80
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:22,533
This is about learning as well. Well that's what you're here for, so you don't need to

81
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:26,533
do, look at the learning links, but this link about multi-platform VR

82
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:30,533
is actually quite interesting. So, it talks a little bit about

83
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:34,533
what Unity's support has, what the list of devices it has

84
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:38,533
support for. That's all the common ones. You've got the Rift, you've got your HTC

85
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:42,533
Vive, you've got your Gear VR, your Cardboard,

86
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:46,533
PS VR, etc. But if we scroll down,

87
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:50,533
there's also a list of games. So, here you go! We see this installer

88
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:54,533
has moved on to the next step. It's actually installing now. But we've got the games

89
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:58,533
that have actually been made with Unity

90
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:02,533
and are VR enabled, VR compatible. So,

91
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:06,533
have a look through these. Some of them have got videos attached,

92
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,533
so take a little watch while the installer is happening,

93
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:14,533
and then, just share in the discussions which ones you think

94
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:18,533
you're going to be taking some inspiration from.

95
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:22,533
OK, so I'm just going to fast-forward through the installation,

96
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:26,533
at this point, and we'll pick up

97
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,066
from there.

98
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:32,066
So my installation has finished and it is time to launch

99
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:36,066
Unity, so I'm just going to make sure that checkbox is checked and hit finish.

100
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:40,066
And we will get Unity launching for the first time,

101
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,066
so you'll be able to take a look at what this Unity Editor is all

102
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:48,066
about. This thing that you have probably heard a lot about and have seen

103
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:52,066
how many great games can be produced for it, and

104
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:56,066
you'll see why it's so powerful and why it's so great!

105
00:06:56,066 --> 00:07:00,066
OK, enough of my ranting and raving. I hope this is going

106
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:04,066
to load soon, so you don't have to keep listening to my voice.

107
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:08,066
OK, so just allowing some access

108
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:12,066
because Unity will want us to log in. This is an optoinal

109
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:16,066
step. You can create a Unity account, and that allows you to buy things like

110
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:20,066
assets, so you don't have to do everything just for

111
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,933
yourself.

112
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:25,933
OK, so this was the login screen I was telling you about, and I misspoke when I said

113
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,933
you don't need to log in, you actually do. You need to create an account,

114
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:33,933
if you don't have a Unity account already, and then,

115
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:37,933
let's just log in. So, I already have one,

116
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:41,933
so I'm just going to type in the details for that.

117
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:45,933
Let's go ahead and sign in. And that's the only time you

118
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:49,933
should have to do that. Subsequently, the Unity Editor will

119
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:53,933
in fact remember you. OK, so it doesn't look like my Unity Editor

120
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:57,933
is actually launching after the login, so I'm just going to quit Chrome

121
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:01,933
and go and launch it from the Desktop.

122
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:05,933
You could also do it from the Start Menu, up to you. Just launch the

123
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:09,933
Unity Editor. As you see, it will be checking the license. You

124
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:13,933
want to select the Personal Edition, because that's the

125
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:17,933
free one, and then, we can go on next and

126
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:21,933
say: "I don't use Unity in a professional

127
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:25,933
capacity". Hopefully you don't yet,

128
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:29,933
seeing as you're just starting out and just starting to learn. So,

129
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:33,933
let's go through and we can start our first project.

130
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:37,933
So, I'm going to create a new basic project, and we can leave

131
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:41,933
all these defaults for now, just to see what it looks like to play.

132
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:45,933
That was my challenge to you, to get it to play in the Unity Editor.

133
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:49,933
So, we get through to this stage. So, it's going to load up

134
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:53,933
all this craziness which is the Unity Editor. We'll dig into this in later lectures, but

135
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,933
the thing I was hoping you might have noticed is there's play button. So if you hit play,

136
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:01,933
we've got all the way to playing or previewing our first game.

137
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,933
Congratulations! That is, you're also up

138
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:09,600
to work with Unity now and move on to the next two sections!
