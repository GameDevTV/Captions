00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:10.866
Welcome! In this video we are going to be comparing the top

2
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.866
5 VR platforms, as they stand at the moment. Obviously all this

3
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:18.866
information is quite subject to change and my apologies if you watch this

4
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.866
in a few months time and there is new news available, but we will do the best

5
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.866
we can to keep this video up to date. We will be comparing the

6
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.866
various strenghs and weaknesses of each of the platforms, so that you can make an

7
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.866
informed decision about which platform you want to start developing for.

8
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.866
And we're going to just cover a few of the basic VR terms

9
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.866
to help you out with understanding all this jargon and being able

10
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:46.866
to read news articles and understand what they're talking about.

11
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:50.866
So, the first thing, let's just copare these devices

12
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:54.866
based on their price and their resolution. This is a very

13
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:58.866
basic measure, but right at the bottom end of the scale we have

14
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:02.866
the Google Cardboard. So, what is the Google Cardboard? Let's take a look!

15
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:06.866
If we just do a quick Google search, we have the "google

16
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:10.866
cardboard". Now as you see, it's incredibly cheap.

17
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.866
Now, why is it cheap? If we go and have a look at the images, you'll

18
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.866
see why it is cheap. It is essentially very DIY. All you have are these

19
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:22.866
two high diopter lenses stuck in a piece of cardboard,

20
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:26.866
and in the back you have to slip in your phone. So the quality of this experience

21
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:30.866
depends a lot on the phone that you slip in the back, and in fact,

22
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:34.866
you can see the resolution can vary from anywhere like an Axis 4

23
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:38.866
all the way up to a Galazy Note, which has an insanely high resolution.

24
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:42.866
In fact, some of the highest resolutions of all these devices,

25
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:46.866
but it really depends and the speed of the phone is quite important, in fact,

26
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:50.866
at two. So, really if you've got a good high end phone, the cardboard

27
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:54.866
might be a very good option for you. Then, next up is this

28
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:58.866
Samsung Gear VR, which also uses a phone in the back, but it has to be a Samsung

29
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:02.866
phone, it has the be one of the Samsung Galaxy Notes. And

30
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:06.866
the price point is $99, so it is more

31
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:10.866
expensive but we will show you why in just a second. So, the Samsung

32
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:14.866
Gear VR and,

33
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:18.866
as you'll see, it's a much more refined piece of kit,

34
00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:22.866
and in fact, your phone has to plug in with a connector into the back here.

35
00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:26.866
And the reason for that is there are extra sensors inside

36
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:30.866
the unit itself. You can see the touchpad, being shown on the side here.

37
00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:34.866
We've obviously got volume buttons, a back button, this is tap sensitive,

38
00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:38.866
so that gives you a few modes of interaction. But also,

39
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:42.866
there are sensors inside the body that help you detect movement

40
00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:46.866
and tilting of the head, so it does a much better job

41
00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:50.866
than the onboard sensors of the phone itself. So, it's a slightly

42
00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:54.866
more polished experience but still using a phone, and as you can see, the highest resolution achievable

43
00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:58.866
is there with the Galaxy Note again. Now, into

44
00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:02.866
the big players! We have the Oculus Rift Consumer Version 1, which is coming out

45
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:06.866
this month, as of recording, and the prices is relatively

46
00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:10.866
high. It's up around the $600 mark!

47
00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:14.866
Now, this is the poster child of VR, and as you can see the resolution is slightly

48
00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:18.866
less. Let's just take a look at what the Oculus Rift is, in case you've not seen one yet.

49
00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:22.866
So, it's the Oculus Rift CV1,

50
00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:26.866
is Consumer Version 1 in case you're interested. As you can see,

51
00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:30.866
it has this fun rig at the back with your

52
00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:34.866
earphones here and this device

53
00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:38.866
is to track your head position. So,

54
00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:42.866
basically it's fairly advanced in comparison

55
00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:46.866
to just sticking a phone in. It has all the screen built in and it plugs into a high end

56
00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:50.866
PC, so you can get much better performance. Then, we have

57
00:03:50.866 --> 00:03:54.866
the PlayStation VR, also known as Project Morpheus in the past, which is slightly

58
00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:58.866
cheaper than the Oculus Rift at only around $400,

59
00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:02.866
and this is probably because PlayStation is very heavily subsidizing it.

60
00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:06.866
It does have a slightly low resolution and generally lower spec, and because it works

61
00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:10.866
with the PS4, you probably can't get the same sort of performance.

62
00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:14.866
Then, the big heavy weight player is the HTC Vive!

63
00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:18.866
So, I'll show you the PlayStation VR first.

64
00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:22.866
It is fairly pretty looking,

65
00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:26.866
very attractive kind of... [Laughs] It looks like an MRI in some senses,

66
00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:30.800
but yeah, quite cool! Then, we have the

67
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.566
HTC Vive

68
00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:37.566
which is the heavy weight player. As you can see, it's ugly as anything

69
00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:41.566
but it is kind of backed up by Steam and HTC

70
00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:45.566
and has some really cool extra sensors in here, which we'll

71
00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:49.566
get into a little bit later, which are there to justify its high price

72
00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:53.566
point of being around twice as expensive as the PlayStation VR.

73
00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:57.566
And as you can see, resolutionwise, it's pretty much on a par with the Oculus Rift.

74
00:04:57.833 --> 00:05:00.766
So, why is resolution not

75
00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:04.766
the only thing we need to worry about? With a 1080 p

76
00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:08.766
television, your typical field of view for this television is about

77
00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:12.766
30 degrees. So, the resolution looks good because the

78
00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:16.766
number of pixels you have per degree is very high,

79
00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:20.766
it's very good, but with VR we typically have more in the order of

80
00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:24.766
100 degrees of field of view. And that 1080 p

81
00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:28.766
spread over 100 starts to look a little bit shoddy, in fact, and

82
00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:32.766
you start to notice the pixels a bit more. So, actually we have a much

83
00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.766
tighter, harder requirement on our pixel density.

84
00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:40.766
So, let's compare things in terms of their pixel density! The Cardboard

85
00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:44.766
has quite a low field of view and a high variation in terms of resolutions,

86
00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:48.766
so the pixels per degree that we can achieve are anywhere from 7 to 14.

87
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:52.766
And in fact, 14 is going to be the best pixel per degree that we can get

88
00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:56.766
when it comes to VR devices. In fact,

89
00:05:56.766 --> 00:06:00.766
the highest pixel per degree that a human eye can detect the difference of

90
00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:04.766
is probably about 60 pixels per degree, so we're still quite a way off

91
00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:08.766
the human limit. The Samsung Great VR, on the other hand, is very

92
00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:12.766
similar. The field of view is slightly bigger, but the pixel so

93
00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:16.766
that has a knock on effect that the pixels per degree are slightly less, but that

94
00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:20.766
a higher field of view does mean a more immersive

95
00:06:20.766 --> 00:06:24.766
experience in VR. The Oculus Rift

96
00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:28.766
goes for that more immersive experience, by making it 110 degrees, so it's

97
00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:32.766
substantially more and the resolution is slightly lower. That allows them

98
00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:36.766
to keep the frame-rate rally high and keep motion sickness down.

99
00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:40.766
The PlayStation VR around the same, slightly smaller

100
00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:44.766
field of view to compensate for the smaller resolution so that the

101
00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:48.766
pixels per degree stays about the same, and the HTC Vive is

102
00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:52.766
almost identical to the Oculus Rift. Let's

103
00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:56.766
compare these devices in terms of their performance now! So, we have

104
00:06:56.766 --> 00:07:00.766
Google Cardboard, which is limited by phone hardware, as is the Gear

105
00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:04.766
VR. Whereas the Oculus Rift CV1 and

106
00:07:04.766 --> 00:07:08.766
the HTC Vive

107
00:07:08.766 --> 00:07:12.766
are high end PC's. In fact, you'll probably need to be shelling out around

108
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:16.766
another grand for your PC. So, if you don't already have

109
00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:20.766
a high end spec PC for your gaming, then these

110
00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:24.766
are going to be very expensive platforms for you. Whereas if you already have a PlayStation

111
00:07:24.766 --> 00:07:28.766
4, then the PlayStation VR might be the thing for you;

112
00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:32.766
although obviously the performance won't be as great as if you have

113
00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:36.766
$1,000 PC. As for sickness, most of these platforms

114
00:07:36.766 --> 00:07:40.766
have done their best to minimize it. Unfortunately the Gear

115
00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:44.766
VR still does have some problems with that. On the one side,

116
00:07:44.766 --> 00:07:48.766
with Google Cardboard, because it looks like you're looking through binoculars, your

117
00:07:48.766 --> 00:07:52.766
tolerance for the lag is actually quite good

118
00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:56.766
and your brain doesn't really get tricked, whereas the Gear VR is in this

119
00:07:56.766 --> 00:08:00.766
uncanny valley where your mind gets tricked a little bit, but because it doesn't have

120
00:08:00.766 --> 00:08:04.766
the degrees of freedom, which we'll see in a minute, it does make you feel a little

121
00:08:04.766 --> 00:08:08.766
bit sick, especially with extended use. Whereas the more high end

122
00:08:08.766 --> 00:08:12.766
platforms seem to be quite good at this, it also depends on the type of game

123
00:08:12.766 --> 00:08:16.766
you're playing. If it's a car racing game, you might be more likely to vomit.

124
00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:20.766
So, the degrees of freedom! This is an interesting one! So,

125
00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:24.766
What we're talking about here is with 3 Degrees of Freedom, we're just talking about rotating

126
00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:28.766
our head, but with 6 degrees we're actually talking about

127
00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:32.766
translating, so moving around the room. So, with

128
00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:36.766
the Cardboard and the Samsung Gear VR, we really can't do any movement around

129
00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:40.766
the room. All we have are the 3 axis of rotation and that is what can contribute to

130
00:08:40.766 --> 00:08:44.766
the sickness in the Gear VR. Now, the Oculus Rift

131
00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:48.766
Consumer Version 1 has partially 6 degrees of freedom, in the sense that

132
00:08:48.766 --> 00:08:52.766
we have to mostly sit still, but if we move our head slightly that

133
00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:56.766
actually does show up in the game and that contributes to its better

134
00:08:56.766 --> 00:09:00.766
sickness or lack of sickness I should say. And the

135
00:09:00.766 --> 00:09:04.766
PlayStation VR does exactly the same thing. However, the HTC

136
00:09:04.766 --> 00:09:08.766
Vive does much better 6 axis

137
00:09:08.766 --> 00:09:12.766
control, which allows you to move around your room, so

138
00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:16.766
you can... A lot of the games are built around having a space that

139
00:09:16.766 --> 00:09:20.766
you can work in and just move around all your

140
00:09:20.766 --> 00:09:24.766
couch, and hopefully you'd move your couch out of the way, but you can move around the

141
00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:28.766
space in your living room and use their controllers to manipulate the game.

142
00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:32.766
So, it's really an immersive experience, where you use your own legs to move yourself

143
00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:36.766
around. As for interaction media, this is a

144
00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:40.766
very interesting point. The Google Cardboard is very limited.

145
00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:44.766
At most it will have one button, it depends which version you get, so let's just have a

146
00:09:44.766 --> 00:09:48.766
look. So, the Google Cardboard versions...

147
00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:56.766
We'll just look at the Google Cardboard. So you'll notice that some of these don't even have a

148
00:09:56.766 --> 00:10:00.766
trigger, whereas some of your models will have a little trigger

149
00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:04.766
at the side, which basically activates

150
00:10:04.766 --> 00:10:08.766
a touch on the screen, and that allows you to do

151
00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:12.766
at least some sort of basic interaction with it.

152
00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:16.766
So, that's very limited. The Gear VR

153
00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:20.766
has a trackpad on the side, with tap and

154
00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:24.766
you can optionally buy a bluetooth hand-held controller, though

155
00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:28.766
those are quite expensive for what they are. Now, the Oculus Rift

156
00:10:28.766 --> 00:10:32.766
CV1 is now shipping with an Xbox controller, with

157
00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:36.766
two hand-held controllers shipping later on

158
00:10:36.766 --> 00:10:40.766
this year. So, those hand-held controllers will really be something to look out for, as they'll

159
00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:44.766
increase the amount of interactions you can have with your game. The PlayStation

160
00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:48.766
VR is backwards compatible with the PS Move controllers, so

161
00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:52.766
that already effectively gives you this two handed controller,

162
00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:56.766
and the HTC Vive has some of the best controller. They're two handed

163
00:10:56.766 --> 00:11:00.766
controllers are very faithful to their location, and

164
00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:04.766
apparently people have been using them in games with light sabers and

165
00:11:04.766 --> 00:11:08.766
really believe that the light saber has been held in their hand. So, it's quite

166
00:11:08.766 --> 00:11:12.766
impressive the level of fidelity that you can get with the HTC Vive.

167
00:11:12.766 --> 00:11:16.766
As for development environments and

168
00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:20.766
platforms and marketplaces, so what are we going to be developing for? The Google

169
00:11:20.766 --> 00:11:24.766
Cardboard you can develop on OSX or Windows. You'll need OSX

170
00:11:24.766 --> 00:11:28.766
for developing for an iPhone, but for Android you could use

171
00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:32.766
either, and then, there is the marketplace. You can distribute

172
00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:36.766
in the App Store or Google Play, depending on which platform you are developing for.

173
00:11:36.766 --> 00:11:40.766
The Samsung Gear VR is Android only, so OSX and Windows,

174
00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:44.766
and again, you can do it in the Google Play store or you have the option of using

175
00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:48.766
Oculus Share as well, which is Oculus's own game sharing

176
00:11:48.766 --> 00:11:52.766
platform. The Oculus Rift again, now is

177
00:11:52.766 --> 00:11:56.766
only Windows, and Windows sadly, no OSX for the time being.

178
00:11:56.766 --> 00:12:00.766
But the Oculus Share is how, where you distribute things

179
00:12:00.766 --> 00:12:04.766
that'll also be direct in Steam and everything else that you usually get for PC games.

180
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:08.766
The PlayStation VR is a closed developer program,

181
00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:12.766
but presumably you'll need Windows to get onto that

182
00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:16.766
closed developer program. The platform, obviously the PlayStation 4,

183
00:12:16.766 --> 00:12:20.766
and the marketplace is the PlayStation Store. The

184
00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:24.766
HTC Vive, again this is Windows, and Windows and

185
00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:28.766
obviously being in league with Steam VR, it's going...

186
00:12:28.766 --> 00:12:32.766
Being Stream VR or being in league with Steam, they

187
00:12:32.766 --> 00:12:36.766
are distributed with Steam or direct. So,

188
00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:40.766
time for a challenge for you! I would like you to choose your device

189
00:12:40.766 --> 00:12:44.766
that you're going to do this course with. You may choose more than one, I'm not limiting you,

190
00:12:44.766 --> 00:12:48.766
it depends on your funds and budget. So, I'd like you to review the

191
00:12:48.766 --> 00:12:52.766
tables above, and by the way, if you don't know where to get those tables, you can go to the

192
00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:56.766
beginning the first lecture of this section and you can go to the

193
00:12:56.766 --> 00:13:00.766
Google Doc, where those tables are. And then, I'd like you to

194
00:13:00.766 --> 00:13:04.766
list your game development goals. This'll help you give a base

195
00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:08.766
for what you need, and then, share your choice in the discussions

196
00:13:08.766 --> 00:13:12.766
and share some justifications about why you have chosen to go with

197
00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:16.766
that platform. OK, I'll see you in the next video,

198
00:13:16.766 --> 00:13:19.900
after you have done that!
