00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
So congratulations on getting to the end of the first sections guys!

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:07.533
What have they done, Sam? So in this first section, you've learned a little bit about

3
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.533
the VR landscape, and hopefully you should feel a bit more comfortable with the different

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:15.533
terms being thrown around and be able to compare the different devices

5
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:19.533
on the market. Absolutely! So, another thing I want to say is, if you are considering developing

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:23.533
something for Apple, it used to be that you had to have a paid Apple Developer account, but now, there's a

7
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:27.533
free Apple Developer account. In fact, your very iTunes ID will work as a

8
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:31.533
free developer account, once you finish clicking your life away to some terms and conditions, but you must read

9
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:35.533
carefully. [Laughs] So, Sam, what's next? So what's next? We're getting

10
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:39.533
stuck into development, and we're going to have a really fun time building our Crossy Road

11
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:43.533
clone. So, what I'd like you to do right now

12
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.533
is go over to the discussions in the right, and I would

13
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:51.533
like you to tell us a little bit abut which platform you have decided

14
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:55.533
you'd like to go with and tell us, you know, iOS or Android.

15
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:59.533
Which one would you prefer? Fantastic! See you in the next section guys!
