Hey, welcome to the course! We are really excited because

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.200
we get to see how much you improve, as you go through the course. So, Sam, what's the

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.200
first thing they need to be doing. The first thing you need to do is get your hands on a Google Cardboard.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.200
They are a very inexpensive, around about $20, and you can buy them off of Amazon

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.200
or whatever you like, and it doesn't really matter which version you get.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.200
But the important thing is that it has a trigger; that will be useful come section

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.200
4, when we're actually using the Google Cardboard. So, get the Cardboard on its way to you,

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.200
but don't wait till it arrives to get stuck into the course. Please get stuck in right away,

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.200
because we're not going to need the Cardboard until section 4. So,

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.200
against this very lecture you have a link to the section notes. They're hosted on

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.200
Google Slides; their live, you can comment and interact over there, and if you want to

12
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.200
you can download them. So once they've got their slides and they've ordered their Cardboard, then what Sam? Well,

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.200
when you've done that, we'd like you to head on over to Unity3D.com,

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.200
where you can get your own copy of Unity downloading and start that installation

15
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.200
process right away, so you don't have to wait. Absolutely, and then

16
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.200
please please introduce yourself, in the discussions, to the other students. Maybe where you're from in the world

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.200
or your interests in VR, maybe what your background is. Stuff like that is really

18
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.200
really helpful, and when you see somebody else's introduction, please do say hey that's cool

19
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200
and try and find some common ground, get a conversation going with the other students. Absolutely!

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.200
I'm really excited, I'm going to be your main instructor through this course, and I can't wait to

21
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.000
see you in there!
