2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
OK, welcome to the first section where you're going to get straight into coding. There's

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a principle called eat the frog. Here's a picture of the book. The idea is that

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
when there's something that you're not so keen on doing if you just get it done and get it out of the way first,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
then life is going to be a lot easier because it's the hesitation that causes the pain right.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, scripting we've noticed, with beginners, is one of those things. They tend to fiddle around with all the pretty

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
stuff in Unity and then avoid the scripting. So sorry, in this course we're not avoiding the scripting, we're

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
going straight in there. In fact, all we're doing in this Number Wizard Console game

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is scripting. So, we're going to get you straight through the difficult

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
bit, give you a fantastic programming foundation in C#, and it's also going to

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
be translated to Boo and Unity Script, and then, from there we'll start to look at opening

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Unity up for you, in the future section. So, Brice, what is Number Wizard Console, and what are

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
they going to be doing? Well, it's a guess the number game. You pick a number in your head and the computer

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
will guess the number for you. And you simply type on the keyboard to tell you

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
yes this guess is correct or this guess is too low, this guess is too high, and the

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
computer kind of searches for your correct number using an

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
algorithm called binary chop or binary search. Which is essentially, you split the search

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
into two sections, which is 0 to 1,000 which are the numbers you are allowed to pick.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It'll say, is it in this half? Then, if you say no, well then it'll

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
say is it obviously in this half? Then, it cuts that one in half and says, which of those two halves

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is it, and it keeps doing it until it finds your number. And it's pretty

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
surprising how quickly it can get to it! So, I mean if you had a number between one

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and a billion, 2 to the power of 32 is over 4 billion, so in

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
about 30 guesses, it could guess a number between 0 and a billion which is

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
pretty impressive actually. It homes in on the number pretty quickly. So, it's a bit of fun!

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And we're going to reuse the code in the next game, where we'll actually start using a

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
interface, Graphical User Interface. So get in, dive in, enjoy the early

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.266
scripting, and we'll see you on the other side! Good luck!
