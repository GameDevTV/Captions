00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Congratulations on completing

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the Console version of Number Wizard! What did they learn. Brice?

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Lots actually. lots and lots of stuff! So. you wrote your first script

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in Unity. You started learning about variables.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
about if conditionals. how to make

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
choices. creating functions to do things.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and also keyboard input. You had a game. you can actually

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
play on the keyboard. And also. really importantly. and you're going to

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
use that all the time. it's learning about how to get information

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
out to the Console. to debug information out. because you're

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
going to be having a much more complex game and lots of things

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
are going to be happening at the same time. So. making sure the

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
information is available to you in the Console. to see exactly what's going on. that's really important!

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So. you've already done that. so well done! Awesome! We've really given you

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a useful foundation here. Printing to the Console is going to get you out of

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
trouble so many times later on. when you're not sure why something is not working.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So. it's fantastic that you've got this far! So.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
well done! Well done! Some ideas for challenging yourself.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if you want to just extend this game a little bit before you go onto the

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
next section. You could try a different number

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
range. You could change the game so that it works with a number between.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I don't know. 1 and 10.000 or 1 and 1 million. whatever.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Or how about making the range choosable by the player. at the

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
beginning. So. you have a bunch of key inputs and you can choose which

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
range you want. Yeah yeah! It could be a little quirky

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
clunky if you do that. because you're going to have to...

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The Console is not really going to give you key input in a particularly

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
nice way. but you could. when they push a key. log that key to the keyboard. Try it.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that'll be a really cool thing to try. responding to those key presses

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and printing them out on the screen. So. player selectable number range

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is what you're talking about? Yeah! And the final thing you can try is. actually. rather than

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
guessing the number half way. in the current range. try just making a

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
random guess. in the current range. so that first if it's

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
1 to 1.000 your first guess is completely random. You go. is it higher or lower than

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
15 or whatever? Just try it! You'll be surprised at how well it works! And it

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
feels a lot more natural when you do that. actually.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It feels like it's a real player. not just a computer that's randomly choosing.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
so that's a lot more fun when you do that! Yeah!

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It kind of hides the obvious trick. and it makes it

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
feel a bit more... It'll be more guesses and it'll take more effort to get to your answer

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but it still works surprisingly well. and it feels. as you said. a bit more

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
alive. So. well done! We're going to take this code. we're going to

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
reuse it in the next section where we'e going to. for the first time. put a User

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Interface on it. Good luck and see you then! See you!
