1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
OK. so here we are inside

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Unity. for the first time. It's quite a complex interface. so

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this first game is going to be specifically designed to only

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
use the Console. So. if you don't

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
see what I see. then go to the top right of Unity.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then. click the drop-down. which is the Layout Drop-Down. and just go to

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Default. so that it ends up looking like this. And then. I want you to

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
find the Console. Now. there are a few ways to find the Console. One way is you can go to

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the Window drop down and then look for

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Console. which is at the very bottom on a Mac. And it will

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
flip over to Console. or you just look for Console. which is in the bottom

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
section of the screen. next to project. Alright. let me talk

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you through the Console just a little bit. So. what do we have here?

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We have an ability to clear lines off the Console. The Console.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
by the way. is just going to be full of lines of text. and our entire game

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is going to be running in this Console. just for this project.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And the purpose is. we don't want your to be confused by all

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
this other complexity of Unity.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Of course. if you're already highly experienced with Unity. you can completely skip this

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
section and just move straight on to the next one. but for a beginner. I would really

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
strongly suggest you start here. because we're also covering programming basics.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
a lot of really really important programming fundamentals in this

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
section. So. back to the Console! You can clear it. you

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
can collapse it. we'll talk about that later. So. all of these bits don't

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
worry about. The bits you do need to be a little bit aware of. especially before we move

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the Console. is theres top right three buttons. This

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
one turns on and off logs to the Console. which we'll be making.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This one turns on and off errors or warnings. rather. the

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
middle one warning triangles. And then. the final one.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the stop sign is for errors. you turn on and off. They're turned on

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
when they're depressed in and slightly lighter. OK. so

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
a bit of a gotcha. in case you've actually clicked that off be careful.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Alright. that's that! So. what I want you to do is to move the

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Console. We'll be looking at

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
moving windows around. in a more advance way later. but I want you to move

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the Console over to the right hand side like this.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Alright. so just grab hold of it and drag it

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to the right hand side. And what that's going to mean is. we can then

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
put MonoDevelop right over the rest of all of this stuff. so that we're

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
just dealing with the Console and MonoDevelop itself. You can

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
grab the divider between the scene or the game and the

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Console on the right here. Just drag if you want and you can

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
adjust things. but you just need a bit of Console on the right hand side.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
OK. now before we leave the Unity Editor.

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I just want to delete the Main Camera in the Hierarchy. So. look for the Hierarchy

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
on the left. Main Camera. and I either go to Edit and Delete

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
or Right click and Delete. because we just don't need it for this

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
project. OK. next we're going to create an empty GameObject.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
because in order for our script to run it needs to

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
be attached to a GameObject. So. we're going to go

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to Game Object. Create Empty. from the Game Object

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Menu. and I want to rename this GameObject Number Wizard. capital

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
N capital W and you can leave no space if you wish.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That's fine! This is called Pascal Case. it means all

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the kind of components of the word have uppercase. so NumberWizard

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
like that! Alright So. that's

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
an empty GameObject. How are you going to add a script to it? A couple of different ways! You can

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
go to Inspector. Add Component. New Script.

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Let's do it that way! And then.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
type NumberWizard. The same component

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
name as the GameObject name in this case. which will

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
normally be the case. but you can add multiple scripts or components

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to the same GameObject. So now. we have a NumberWizard Script!

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's sitting in the base of Assets. Let's be tidy. from the start. and put it

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in a folder called Scripts. because that's how we're going to go on.

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So. I've made a folder by right clicking down in Assets. going to Create.

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and then. Folder. Call it Scripts and then drag

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
NumberWizard into it. Fantastic! Alright. this

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
other thing here. Main. it's the scene or the level used

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
interchangeably. It's also at the top of your screen up here. Main.

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We need some sort of scene or a level. We need at least

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
one level for the game to run. so that needs to be there. That's just fine!

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Alright. so we've created our NumberWizard Script. let's

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
go into it! Now. just quickly rearrange

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
your MonoDevelop. Move it to the left hand side of your screen. so

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that you can see ideally both Mono... If any funny tool boxes come

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
up in Mono. just close them. So. you can see both Mono

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and the Console. So. click on your Console in Unity.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Command or Alt Tab. back to MonoDevelop. and just

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
jiggle between them. until you can see as much Console as possible.

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You might have a much bigger screen resolution than me. I'm actually on a really

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
big monitor here. but I've got the screen resolution

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
really low for you guys. so you can see the text really clearly.

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So. this is the situation we want to end up with. just with the Console visible

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
on the right and the code visible on the left. Fantastic!

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We're going to write our first bit of code right now! Let's do it!

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So. we're going to go inside of the Start function. For now. we're only going to focus

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
on what's going inside the Start function.

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We're using that because we know it's going to run. it runs at the very beginning

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
when the game first runs. Don't worry about any of the rest of the stuff out

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
here. we're going to keep our context where the cursor is for now.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Later on. we will zoom out and zoom out until you understand

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
absolutely everything that is on this screen. but for now. let's

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
focus here. Cool! So. we're going to use a statement called print.

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Old as the houses! print ("Welcome

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to Number Wizard"); and just do that!

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And you can do same! print ("Welcome to Number Wizard"); Now. look

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
there's some syntax. there's some language. here. and the computer is super

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
fussy about how we type this. So.

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
this is a

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
string inside print. It's a string because it's in quotes.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
OK. that'll come clear in a moment. And then.

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the brackets indicate that print

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
requires some parameters. It requires some input. so print is a

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
function or a method. that requires something inside

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
its brackets. and what that requires is a string. And then.

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
on the end of every single line in C# we need a

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
semicolon. Without a semicolon.

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
it doesn't know the line has ended. It just ignores white space.

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Alright. let's stop chatting and get on with seeing what this does!

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Now. it's not saved yet! You know it's not saved for

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
two reasons. One. the circle up here.

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Here's a circle. when I save watch what happens to the circle.

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It turns to a cross. Now. you would be closing the tab. Previously it was telling

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
you. you could close me. but I'm not saved yet. Alright. the other

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
way you can tell is. if I make another change. you get a star on the

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
end of the file name there. Alright. there

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
being at the very top of the screen. next to where it says NumberWizard.cs.

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Alright. great so make sure your script is saved. go back to Unity

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and run it! Now. what you should be seeing over here is

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Welcome to Number Wizard! and then a load of other bumf. Under every line. you're going to get

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
bumf. which is telling you where this log has come from.

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's come from UnityEngine.MonoBehavior. Again. if you can still

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
see it on your screen. make sure this little bubble is turned on. The bubble that enables

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
logs. If you don't. you won't see anything alright.

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
If you have a 1 but you can't see anything. it's because that is turned off.

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
OK. so that is that! We have

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
printed Welcome to Number Wizard. Fantastic! OK. so I've

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
got a challenge for you now which is. I want you to print another line.

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
without my help. And this is your first mini challenge!

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
During a mini challenge. I'm going to tell you what result I want. and then.

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I want you to do it. Pause the video. so that you can make your own mistakes.

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
do your own learning. and then. unpause the video when it's time

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to check your answer against what I've done.

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So. here we go! I want you to just put another print statement

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
immediately underneath. that says Pick a number in your head. but don't

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
tell me". Alright. simple as that! Really easy challenge

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
for the first video. Go for it! Pause the video now.

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
OK. welcome back! So.

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
this is how I did it! I'm just going print ("Pick a number

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in your head. but

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
don't tell me"); OK!

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And then. close the bracket and add a semicolon on the end

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
of every line. Congratulations. a super simple video

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
but you're into scripting! Make sure it works by saving.

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
going to Unity. and running! Now. if

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
it was already running. you're going to need to stop it running and click

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
play again. There you go. now you get your two logs! "Welcome to Number Wizard".

149
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Pick a number but don't tell me. Fantastic! Well done! See you in the next video!
