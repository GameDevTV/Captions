
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
OK, let's get this game finished up and cleaned off

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
or cleaned up and finished off or some combination

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of those things. So, let's do it! Let's have a look at what's going on

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
then. Firstly, when the game finishes, it's not starting

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
again, so that's a problem. Very very easy to sort out!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
When the computer has printed "I won!", why doesn't it just call

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
StartGame();? That would be easy wouldn't it? Let's try it!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm sure it will work! Let's just see it working?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Play, so I'm just going to say, oh you guessed me,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
500, "I won!", and then, it gives me all the instructions again

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and gives me the option to continue guessing, which

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can do. But it's really not clear, looking at

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
this Console, where the game started again. So, why don't we put a visual,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
a simple visual break-in, so that

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we can see that. And the way that I'm going to do that is just say print

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and then a bunch of equals, until I get

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
about the same width or a little bit less wide than ("Welcome to Number

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Wizard"), like that! Now, let's just see the effect of that.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's pretty obvious but if I won the game straight away,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
then I would have this, well nice... This is as good as you

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
can do in a Console, kind of, line of

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
equal signs that just says, OK you're in a new game! So, that's one thing

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
done! That's what we needed to do. Now, the other thing you

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
may notice is, the numbers don't reset. Let me go back to Unity

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
again. Excuse all the diving back and forth. And let's,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you know, do some movement. Let's get, OK, 763

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but now look, it's back with the same numbers. Why? In fact,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
why? What I mean is, it's for you to work out

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
why, for a second. So, if I give you a challenge where it's just a

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
work it out, what are you actually going to do? I suggest you write

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
down the answer, rather than just have it in your head, because it's

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
going to be very easy to tell yourself what you imagined is what you

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
actually see me tell you, and then, it's kind of deceiving yourself from

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
stuff. So, why not write down why you think

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the number don't reset. Take a look at the code, pause the video,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
do that, and come back when you're ready!

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
OK, so what did you write down? Well,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think what's happening is that we are initializing these

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
numbers at the very very beginning, when the game

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
starts, and then, we're never changing them, which isn't

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
brilliant. So, what we need to do is just move

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
these simultaneous declarations

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and initializations from the top here, to where?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, it would make sense to put them in StartGame () right?

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
OK, so there they are! And now,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
they should work right within StartGame (), because every time

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
we restart the game we're going to reset these numbers. So,

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that should work right? Well, let's see!

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, nasty compiler error! "The name guessed does not exist

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
in the current context". Where, please show me Mr. Console?

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
On NumberWizard line 32.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, here's line 32.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's the min, it's the first time I get to the min. Well, min can't see...

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, sorry. the Update function

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
cannot see min or max or guess. It's a

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
scoping problem again. Why? Because they're declared in StartGame ()

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and initialized in StartGame (), i.e. they're given

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
their value, but

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
they were not declared anywhere that is

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
accessible to both StarGame () and Update (). That's your problem!

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, that's what you're going to need to do is declare them,

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
at the top. So, lets do that declare but not initialize, which

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
means we take off the values. Does

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
that make sense? Just by declaring them, just by bringing them

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
into existence, before StartGame () or

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
guess or NextGuess () even start running. That will

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
fix that compiler error, and you should find now, that when we try and

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
run that you can just play the game and it works. Brilliant! And

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that when you play the game, let's just do that again.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's, firstly, go to I don't know... Ooh,

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
now my ups and downs aren't working. So, we have another

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
challenge. Why why am I getting 0's coming out

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
of everywhere now, suddenly. So, what have I done wrong? int

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
max; int min; int guess; max =

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
1000; min = 1; guess = 500;

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hmmm, should be OK, shouldn't it?

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So, let's just take a look at that! We need to do the first bit of

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
debugging. Click play. OK.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
"Is the number higher or lower than 500?" It looks like it's guessing 500,

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so let' me say =, and it goes "I won!". Fine, and then

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we're back to where we were. Equals, I won, so it keeps going around in circles.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Good! Let's go down. "Higher or lower than 0?"

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So why, when I push the Down Arrow Key, is it setting the guess to

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
0? Let's take a look at the code.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
max = guess; min = guess;

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
hmm? OK, now

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
here's the lesson! The lesson is that, it's about

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
declarations and initializations. This

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
is a declarations, int it's the type and the

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
name of the variable, so I'm declaring them there. The problem is,

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm redeclaring them here, inside StartGame ().

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want to be saying int max =,

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I just want to say max =, min =, and

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
guess =. Then, these variables will refer

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
to the variables that were declared at the top. OK.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Easy mistake to make, because I just made it. Let's have a look!

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Up and down, we get to 226,

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
hit Return, it starts a new game at 500.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
let's just check the edge conditions, up to 1,000. Awesome!

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Down to 1, up to 1,000.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Awesome, I think it's working! And the

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
beady eyed among you may have noticed that the

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
system prints 1001,

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the first time it runs. So, let's just quickly run the game!

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And it says here, the highest number you can pick is 1,001,

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
which is actually incorrect. It should be 1,000,

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and the reason for that is that, we do our max = max + 1;

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
here on line 19, whereas we would be better moving that

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
down to the bottom of the function, somewhere underneath here.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, I'm going to leave that to you, as an exercise to the reader, and Brice

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
will be fixing that in the next section. Basically we're there! You

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
have completed the Number Wizard Console game. You have hopefully

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
gained a lot of confidence in your programming skills, and we look

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
forward to building in some User Interface and some more interesting

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
stuff, in the rest of the course. See you soon!
