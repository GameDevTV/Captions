00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey, after watching this video, you'll be able to respond to

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a player's key presses, explain a bit more about what the Start

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and Update methods do, and navigate the Google and Unity

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
docs, with a bit more confidence. So, let's dive in and take a look at it!

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So, here we have our Console game, which currently

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
does nothing but log four things to the Console, so let's expand upon

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
on it! Into NumberWizard.cs Script.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Cool! So, let's just go to the bottom of our Start function. We're doing everything

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in the Start function, for now.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The next thing we need the computer to do, once it's told you you're allow to

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
guess and think of a number between 1 and 1,000 rather,

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is to make its first guess. So, let's go ahead with that! print

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
("Is the number

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
higher or lower than

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
500?");

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
OK, micro challenge

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
for you! Print another statement that says: Up arrow for higher,

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
down for lower, return for equals.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
OK, go ahead and do that now.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's not very

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
exciting, it's rather simple. ("Up

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
arrow for higher, down for

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
lower, return for

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
equal"); Fantastic!

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Remember, this is good practice, getting your brackets and your quotes right!

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Talking about getting your brackets and your quotes right, look at my

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
first statement here. I've noticed that the end bracket and

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the quote are in orange, rather than black, and that means

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the computer is still interpreting that as a string,

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the reason is, because I haven't told it to stop interpreting

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
it with a string. I missed my close

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
quote. Very naughty! OK, so

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
next thing we need to do is get some input. So, do you want to see the effect of that?

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Well, let's see the effect of what we've done. It's not exciting but

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
it's something. Here you go. Is it higher or lower than 500?

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And then, tell them what they need to do. This is called affordance.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"Up arrow for higher, down for lower, return

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
for equal". OK, you can't quite read it, but

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
if you were playing this for real, not that you would, it would be on

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
a slightly wider Console. Alright, I'll tell

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
you what we can do. We can actually fix that by just saying ("Up += higher,

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
down = lower, return

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
= equal"); just for fun. There you go!

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
How's that? Alright, let's go ahead and use the first

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
new function you're going to learn, which is Input, and that's how you're going to get

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Input from the user. Now, how

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
are you going to find out about this thing, or how would you know it was Input, in the

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
first place? Let's answer the second question first. How would you know

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
it's Input, in the first place? Well,

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What I would do is I would just say, Get keyboard input

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
unity, into Google. So, let me bring my Google window

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
across, and let's "get keyboard

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
input

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
unity". OK, here we go! There you go, and

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
it wouldn't be long looking down that, before you'd get the trail

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
of this input thing. Alright, in fact, we can

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
go straight here to scripting API, Input

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
.GetKeyDown. That would be one way of doing it. Another would be to know that

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
it's the command Input, and to go straight to the docs for that. Now

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
warning, super handy keyboard shortcut

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
coming up, although you may need to adjust your Keybindings

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
in MonoDevelop, Preferences here.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Alright, or maybe slightly differently on the PC, but here's a really

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
useful Keybinding. When you're on a command you want to know more about, hold down the

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the Command key and press apostrophe, and it will search

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the Unity docs for that command. It'll search the Scripting

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
API docs. There's two sets of docs, the Manual,

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which is for basically anything you want to know the answer to when you're in the Unity

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Editor, and the Scripting API, which is for

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
questions about scripting. Alright,

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so this Input thing, here it is! Now, it's going to tell you lots of

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
stuff about Input, and one of the things it's going to tell you is that

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
you can GetKeyDown. I'm just going to jump down to it,

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
GetKeyDown, and that's the one we're going to use. OK,

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Input.GetKeyDown. Now, if you

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
look down in their example, you see that inside the

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Update function, not the Start function, they say this.

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So, why don't we just copy their code for the moment. If that

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
do that. We're actually going to need to modify their code a little bit,

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
because I very naughtily missed some squiggly brackets,

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
but that's OK, we can fix that up!

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, over in here in Unity, not inside the Start function but

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
inside the Update function. Why inside the Update function?

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Well, this is your first intro to Start and Update. Start only happens

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
once, at the beginning of the script, at the beginning of the program,

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the beginning of the game. If you weren't holding that key down at the very

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
beginning, at the instance it checks, then it would miss it. So, it needs to be

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
an Update, which is called every frame. How many

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
frames? Well, it depends how many frames per second the game is running,

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
at that moment and it varies. It could be none or 1

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
or 50 or 1,000.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So, but anyway, every single time it gets a chance, every

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
frame it will check. So, here's our statement. What I don't like about

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
this statement is that it doesn't have the right curly bracket structure,

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
for my slightly obsessive nature, so I'm going to put the right curly

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
brackets in. And now, we need to modify this, so that

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
it works, not for

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the Space Key but for

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
pushing the Up and the Down Arrows, what we're going to use. So,

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
take a look in the docs, and see if you can work out how to modify this,

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
so that it works for Up and Down Arrow.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And change this line here for print

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
("Up arrow

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
pressed"); OK, so don't get

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
confused with this Down here and the Up. This is a key going

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
down, now you're using your key into the keyboard, and this is the

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Up arrow that you're pusing down. So, what I need you to do is change

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
this bit, inside the brackets, so that it responds

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
to an Up Arrow press and logs it out to the Console.

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Try that as a challenge now and pause the video and come

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
back when you're done. Hey welcome back!

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, the thing that you need is this (KeyCode.UpArrow)

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
like this. So, what is

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
KeyCode.UpArrow? Well, what you need to know is the result of

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
what comes out of KeyCode.UpArrow is the

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
UpArrow keycode. OK, you can find that in the docs. I found

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
it by looking... I can't remember exactly where I did

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
find it? Here you go, I went to Input Manager,

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I think? Hmm, where did it go?

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Where did I go? In a second, I shall find it! It's

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
in here somewhere! So, I tell you what, I would

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
do a Google search for unity

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
up arrow

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
key or something like that. And then, you'll qute

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
quickly find, here you go, KeyCode.UpArrow in somebody's example

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
code, and it will come up several times, you'll find.

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
OK, so that's how I discovered what it was, just by a bit of

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
hunting and sniffing. You haven't seen an if statement yet, don't

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
worry about it too much. What you need to know is that what

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
is happening, inside the if statement, will only happen

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
if this condition is met. We'll talk about it at another time. Alright,

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I have a challenge for you then. What we want you to do is,

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I want you to do exactly the same for the Down Arrow.

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Alright, so let's make another statement,

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
almost identical to this one, that works for the Down Arrow and

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
logs out to the Console, "Down arrow pressed". Please pause the video,

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
go ahead, and do that little challenge right now.

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
OK, welcome back! So, this is

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
a pretty simple challenge. It's just a cut and paste job, so copy that initial

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
code, and then, just paste down here.

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And you're going to change Up Arrow for, you guessed it,

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
DownArrow! And you're going to change this to Down.

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Fantastic! That is it! Let's just test all this and we

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
are done! So, back into Unity, after

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
having saved our script. Check here and check up

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
here, that you've saved, or just hit Command S. That's what I

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
tend to do. Dive into Unity, play it.

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It's giving you the instructions, but as long as I've

149
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
clicked in the Game Window, by the way you had to have clicked in the Game Window.

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Up Arrow says "Up arrow pressed". Down Arrow says, "Down arrow

151
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
pressed". Great! Fantastic! Now, you might

152
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
want to turn Collapsing on, on your Console. This way, it just logs every line

153
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
separately. The other little thing you've got here is the Collapse Button in

154
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the Console. Underneath, you have

155
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
the button that says Collapse, and now, every time I go up and down, provided

156
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I'm clicked in the Game Window. If I haven't selected the Game Window, it won't listen to the

157
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
keys, then you see the number

158
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
against the "Up arrow pressed" and "Down arrow pressed" increments,

159
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
to say I've just logged another line to the Console, that's identical

160
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to something I've logged before, so I'm just going to collapse

161
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that into a single line there. Either way, they both work.

162
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Congratulations! See you soon!
