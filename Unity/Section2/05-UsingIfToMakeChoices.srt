00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.670
Hey! In this video we're going to learn a
lot more about these wonderful if statement

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.880
things. so let's get on and do it by example.
Firstly. I want to explain a little bit about

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
indentation. So. this Start function. every
single statement within the Start function.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.570
is indented by the same amount. It's four
spaces but actually don't use spaces please. use

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.849
a tab. So. there's a tab. it just happens
to be four characters in front of absolutely

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.070
everything. so that indicates that all these
things are inside the Start function. So.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.230
let's look at that Update function. In the
Update function. all of these statements are

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
at that level of indentation as well. See
how easy it is for the eye to follow. Similarly

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.750
inside the if statement. all of its statements.
that it's going to run inside the code block

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.360
inside the curly brackets. will also be at
this level of indentation. So. to give you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.039
an example. I'm going to print and then ("Example");
OK. now because I want to be consistent I'm

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.789
going to take that space away. so let's just
save that. What's it going to give when I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.650
push key down? Think about what it's going
to give. in the Console. OK. let's have a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
look and see what happens. When I push key
down. what do we get? Down arrow pressed.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.729
When I push key up. what do I get? Up arrow
pressed and Example. I hope that makes sense.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.610
if you're in Collapse Mode you're going to
get something slightly different. when you

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.549
continue to press keys. because what it's
going to do is it's going to just layer the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.009
same things on top of each other. so every
time it logs the same thing it just increments

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:30.640
the number. as previously explained. Alright
fantastic! So. that explains what indentation

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.090
does. Any other statements we put inside this
if statement. we would put at this level of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.409
indentation. Cool! I'm going to get rid of
that example line now for you. Alright. so

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.310
here's a simple challenge for you then. We
want to add a third if statement. which responds

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.140
to the Enter key and logs the words I "Won!"
to the console. Third if statement. responding

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.990
to the Enter key and logs the words "I Won!"
Go ahead and do that now please. OK. so this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.049
is how I'm doing it. I'm copying what's there.
I am going to guess that it's KeyCode.Enter.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:10.500
I don't think it is. because it's come up
in red. so I'm going to try one other thing.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.239
by hacking away until I go and look at the
docs. I'm going to try ("Enter") like that.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.680
It's looking promising. let's try it. because
I haven't got anything gone red. OK. so I

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.459
just want it to say "I won". OK. now let's
save and try it. see if we've got the right

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:32.830
key code. Play...Input name key code. What's
it saying? Let's pause. click on the error.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.340
and you can expand out the window if you want.
Key Enter is unknown. OK. it doesn't understand

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.810
Enter. so we've got to go and find out what
the Enter key code is. So. there are a few

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.700
ways of doing it. We may as well stay in the
safety of the Unity docs for a minute. so

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.090
I'm going to go Input.GetKeyDown. I'm going
to go Command and Apostrophe or Control and

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.110
Apostrophe on a PC. It's just the way of looking
up the docs for the currently selected word.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.290
Go into Input.GetKeyDown and let's see if
we can find ourselves a list of all of the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.150
key codes. Here we go. key code here. Now.
do we have Enter somewhere? I'm going to do

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.180
an in page search. in my browser. for keypad
Enter. that's possible we could use Keypad

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.860
Enter. I think I really mean Return. so you've
got to be careful about your keyboard. you've

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.370
got Enter and Return. and they're two different
keys. I really mean Return. so I'm going to

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.830
use Return. and here you go. And what is that?
It's KeyCode.Return. Alright. so that's a

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.340
typical thing you're going to go off and do.
is have a little nosy and find out what you

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.760
should be using. and I think what we should
be using is KeyCode.Return. like that. So.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:44.480
let's just save and test. Now. if I push Enter
or Return. it says "I won!". Perfect! And

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.470
then. it keeps logging "I won!". every time
I hit it. Well. that's great! Alright. so

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.260
we can go up and down. Well. if I'm click
in the Game Window. remember. Up Arrow Pressed.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.849
Down Arrow Pressed. "I Won!" if you hit Return.
Good. good. good. good! OK. so the only other

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.730
thing that's not fantastic here is that. if
I was to push two keys at the same time. like

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.909
up and down. look what it does. It logs both
Up and Down. at the same time or Down and

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.180
Return. and actually I want it to only log
one key. So. the way we're going to do that

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.820
is use something called an else if. So currently
we're doing this if. and then. it immediately

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.990
checks the next condition and if the Down
Key. the Up Arrow Key rather is still down

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.259
when I push the Down Arrow Key. then it's
going to do both of those things. I want it

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.430
to exclusively check to see which of the keys
is pressed. not all of them. and the way we

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:39.520
do this is we just say I put else here. And
then. I delete back. so that it says else

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.690
if like that. OK. that's the format. Let's
just do it again. else OK. and then. the same

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.250
for the Return Key. Now. it's only very subtly
different behavior. Let's save and look at

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.490
it. it should still operate in the same way.
Up and Down and Return. but if you do Up and

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.830
Down at the same time. it'll just pick which
ever one you pushed first. most of the time.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.900
It depends how fast the frame rate is. actually.
It may actually... your key may be down for

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.970
two frames. in which case it is actually going
to still log both. but generally you'll get

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.990
one or the other. OK. so that's just an introduction
really. the main purpose of this is an introduction

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.270
to the else if statement. So. that's it now.
hopefully you understand a lot more about

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.169
if statements. not a huge amount more you
ever need to know about them. by the way.

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.320
So. congratulations! See you soon!
