00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi! In this video you're going to learn to create variables in

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
your scripts. assign values to variables. and then use

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
number variables inside strings or with strings.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
OK. so let's dive into our NumberWizard.cs

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Script. as an example here. So. we have our script on

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the left and our Console on the right. We're building an entirely Console based

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
game. remember. just for the first project of this course.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So. we have a couple of things that

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we know we're going to use more than once. i.e. the high

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
number and the low number. in the range. that you're allowed

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to make your guess. It says. "Pick a number in your head. but don't tell me". The next thing

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it's got to tell you is. between what and what. Say 1 and

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
1.000. So. we're going to use that high and low

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
very often. so I'm going to show you how to use something called a variable.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which is something that the computer can keep track of and

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is allowed to change at runtime. So. here

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we are. we're going to define int. which is the type of variable. It's an integer

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we use integers when it's something countable. So.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
numbers. whole numbers are countable. We would use a different

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
type. if it wasn't countable. OK. so int and

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
we're going to call the variable max. So. the next thing that comes after the

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
type is the name. so int max. and we could call it what I like. what we

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
like. We could call it max or maximum or whatever. but I'm going to call it max.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Equals. = is an odd symbol. it doesn't

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
really equal it's actually an assignment. I would prefer that it was kind

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
of = forward slash or something like that. but it isn't. so we have to live with the

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
syntax we have. int max = 1000.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And what do I need here. apart from to type straight?

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
A semicolon! Absolutely. on the end of every line!

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So. what we've done there is we've made a variable called max that

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
currently. at this moment. is going to be = to 1000.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it's of type integer. which means that it's a whole number.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It can only be a whole number. Alright. micro

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
challenge for you! I want you to find another integer. immediately below.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
called min. and I want you to make it = to 1. Pause

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the video. go ahead. and do that now please! Please do it!

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Please. you'll learn so much more!

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
OK welcome back! Here it is! int

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
min = 1; Not rocket science. but could

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
form the basis of some rocket science. if we were to go on and expand

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
on it enough. Alright. so next thing we need to do

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
is actually tell the user what range they can pick their numbers in.

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So. I'm going to do something like this!

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
print ("The highest

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
number you

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
can pick is ". Space

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because I want a space after my is. Close the string.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because we're no longer in the string. by closing the

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
quotes. Then. a plus! Now. it doesn't actually matter how many spaces

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I put before my +. so I'm going to put an ugly number for a moment.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And then. max. which is that variable. Now. notice

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it's also helping us. because it knows about max.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Close the brackets. close the

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
semicolon. Let's save our script and see the effect in

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Unity. It's going to be a pretty predictable effect. Here it is!

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Ooh. and there it is! "The highest number you can pick is

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
1000". Alright. it's pretty

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
hopefully turned this max

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
number into a string for us. The + operator

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
has done something clever here. it's called overloading and we don't need to worry about it now.

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But just be aware. you are mixing types here. You are mixing a

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
string. in these quotes. with an integer.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but this statement handles it. This + operator handles

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
it. it's all cool! I'm going to get rid of my number of ugly spaces. I was just trying to

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
demonstrate that the spaces you use outside of the string don't matter.

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The spaces you use inside the string do matter!

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
If I didn't have a space at the end of is. well go ahead and try it! Get rid

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of your space between is and the quotes and see

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
what happens in the Console. I will leave that to you. Alright.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
another thing I'm going to leave to you is the next challenge. Fairly simple.

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I want you to print another line that says The lowest number you can pick is".

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
with your space. and then. use the min variable.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
OK. pause the video. go ahead.

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and make it say. "The lowest number you can pick is 1". using

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the variable. Alright. here's a

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
solution! Print. really

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
basic stuff for the moment. but if we get you into the basics of programming

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
properly. you're going to be setup for life!

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
...pick is. space.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
close. There we go. like that! It's

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
very hard to talk and type at the same time. especially when you're typing and saying

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
different things. but anyway I seem to manage it! Save that. test it.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and I think we are done! There you go!

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
"The highest number you can pick is 1000". "The lowest number you can pick is 1".

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
We are all good. Congratulations! You are slowly

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
becoming a scripting. programming coding ninja!

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.966
See you soon!

really equal it's actually an assignment. I would prefer that it was kind

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
of = forward slash or something like that, but it isn't, so we have to live with the

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000

Please, you'll learn so much more!

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
OK welcome back! Here it is! int

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
min = 1; Not rocket science, but could

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
form the basis of some rocket science, if we were to go on and expand

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
on it enough. Alright, so next thing we need to do

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Close the brackets, close the

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
semicolon. Let's save our script and see the effect in

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Unity. It's going to be a pretty predictable effect. Here it is!

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ooh, and there it is! "The highest number you can pick is

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
hopefully turned this max

59

number into a string for us. The + operator

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
has done something clever here, it's called overloading and we don't need to worry about it now.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But just be aware, you are mixing types here. You are mixing a

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
string, in these quotes, with an integer,

63

but this statement handles it. This + operator handles

64

it, it's all cool! I'm going to get rid of my number of ugly spaces. I was just trying to

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
demonstrate that the spaces you use outside of the string don't matter.

what happens in the Console. I will leave that to you. Alright,

OK, pause the video, go ahead,

and make it say, "The lowest number you can pick is 1", using

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the variable. Alright, here's a

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
solution! Print, really

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
basic stuff for the moment, but if we get you into the basics of programming

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
properly, you're going to be setup for life!

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
...pick is, space,

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
close. There we go, like that! It's

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
very hard to talk and type at the same time, especially when you're typing and saying

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
different things, but anyway I seem to manage it! Save that, test it,

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and I think we are done! There you go!

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
"The highest number you can pick is 1000". "The lowest number you can pick is 1".

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We are all good. Congratulations! You are slowly

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
becoming a scripting, programming coding ninja!

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,966
See you soon!
