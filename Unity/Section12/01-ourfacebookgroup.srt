00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So hi and in this video

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we're going to be talking to you about the Facebook group. So. the Facebook

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
group is an awesome place. we've setup for you

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to use. It's a community of people. like you. And what can you

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
do with the Facebook group. Ben? Well. what the intention of the group. which

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you can find at facebook.com/groups

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
/completeunitydeveloper. It's there...

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The purpose of that is to allow you to interact.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
not only with your fellow students. which you can already do in the discussions.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but with the wider world. We want you to invite your friends

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
into the group. we want them to try playing your games

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with you. and then. we want to get their ideas. and maybe you can

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
make the games that they want. So. it's owned by the community.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
it's run by the community. and it's

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
an open group. We really hope that you go over there and

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
make it your own. So. yeah! Hopefully we'll

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
see you in the group. where you can share your games and learn more about Unity and share

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
tips together. to see how to better work with making games.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So. see you in the group and see you on Facebook! And see you there!

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And when you go to Facebook. there's one thing to note that. we also have a Facebook

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
page. which is basically a webpage on Facebook. That's

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
where we put all our updates and everything. You're welcome to like that

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as well. and that's a great place to keep in touch with what's going on in the

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
course and we also share some student stories there ourselves. Basically.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the page is our voice. the banner is our photo.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it's a website within the Facebook. and it's facebook

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
.com/unitycourse. The group. however.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is yours and the banner is full of all your faces

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to reflect the fact it's a community. The group is way more awesome.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because it's yours. Because it's yours. See ya!
