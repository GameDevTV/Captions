1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.633
So congratulations

2
00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:05.633
on getting to the end of this massive course, that is no small achievment!

3
00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:09.633
Well done! The whole point of this video is to introduce you to the other courses we've got available,

4
00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:13.633
so you can deepen your knowledge. I'm going to introduce you to the courses and the relevent

5
00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:17.633
co-instructors, one by one, and then, at the end I'll summarize, give you all the links

6
00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.633
you need, and a special Unity Student Discount. So let's start with

7
00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:25.633
Blender! Blender is a Free 3D Modeling tool, and I've teamed up with...

8
00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:29.633
Hi guys, my name is Michael! ...with Michael! So the problem with Unity is, you can only

9
00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.633
make very basic 3D models like cubes and spheres and things.

10
00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.633
What can they make with Blender, Mikey? Well anything your imagination gives you,

11
00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:41.633
you can make in Blender. Amazing! And Mikey takes you from complete

12
00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:45.633
beginner. So even if you've done no 3D modeling and you don't think you're an artist, can somebody who's

13
00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:49.633
never done any art use this course? Certainly! All a great artist is, is someone who

14
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.633
has practiced for hundreds and hundreds of hours. So if you've not done it before,

15
00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:57.633
we'll take you from the very basics, up to those hundreds and hundreds of hours.

16
00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:01.633
And Blender's a free package even, that's just as powerful as something like

17
00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:05.633
3D Studio or Maya. So this would be a great time, if you're at say

18
00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:09.633
Bowl Master or beyond, to start making your own 3D assets. Thanks, Mikey!

19
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:13.633
Thank you! Take care! So 2016 is the year that Virtual

20
00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:17.633
Reality is finally going to take off! The problem is, most people don't know how to develop

21
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:21.633
for it, so I have teamed up with Sam! High, I'm Sam! Cool,

22
00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:25.633
Sam! So what is this VR course going to teach them, taught in Unity by the way? Yes,

23
00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:29.633
so we're going to take you through, step by step, everything you need to develop your own VR

24
00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:33.633
maps, and as Ben said, we're going to be doing it in Unity. And you might think that it's too

25
00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:37.633
expensive to get into VR right now. Well what do they need, Sam? What's the minimum bit of

26
00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:41.633
hardware they need. So all you need is a $20 Google Cardboard!

27
00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:45.633
You don't need any fancy equipment like the Oculus Rift, which costs a lot of money, and we'll

28
00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:49.633
also be teaching you how to use the Samsung Gear VR, if you happen

29
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:53.633
to have one of those. Fantastic! So you just pop your smart phone in the Carboard

30
00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:57.633
and you're good to go! So take a look at the Virtual Reality course,

31
00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:01.633
and start getting ahead of the curve right now! Thanks, Sam! Thank you! I really appreciate it!

32
00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:05.633
So moving on from Virtual Reality we have my Game Physics course! So

33
00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:09.633
Unity has a pretty powerful physics system in it. There's a couple of challenges, if it can't do

34
00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:13.633
something it can't do it, and secondly, we don't really know what's going on under the hood.

35
00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.633
So in my Game Physics course, we take you step by step through how to make your

36
00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:21.633
own Game Physics Engine, and then, we use that knowledge to extend and improve

37
00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:25.633
upon Unity's built in physics, to get all sorts of interesting and weird

38
00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:29.633
effects, that just aren't possible using the standard physics! So if you're interested in learning

39
00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:33.633
more about physics, come and see me in Game Physics! Finally,

40
00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:37.633
if you really want to level up your game development, you need to check out the Complete

41
00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:41.633
Unreal Developer! This uses C++, which

42
00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:45.633
is a language that is similar in many ways to C# but is the industry standard!

43
00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:49.633
It's going to give you more flexibility and more performance than C#, and everything

44
00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:53.633
you've learned about C# will be a fantastic grounding for your journey into C++.

45
00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:57.633
Furthermore, Unreal is a Triple A game engine! You will

46
00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:01.633
have seen some amazing games made with the Unreal Engine! I don't know about you, but when

47
00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:05.633
I see that logo come up I think, yes this game is going to look good! So Unreal is

48
00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:09.633
the next step in your game development career. Please join me over on the Complete

49
00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:13.633
Unreal Developer, which is a course that's the result of

50
00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:17.633
another Kickstarter that funded over 1,000%! Documentation from Unreal is terrible,

51
00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:21.633
our solutions are great! Come and join me over there now!
