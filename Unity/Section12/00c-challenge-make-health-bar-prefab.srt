00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So. I've got a challenge for you guys!

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you've made it this far in the course. I think you're up for it!

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So. I want you to try and make a Health Bar

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Prefab. that is simple but good enough to

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
put on the Unity Assets Store. Now. I'm not going to show you how to do it.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The course is basically over. In fact. I'm having

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a lot of trouble letting go. I really should be working on the next course. which is

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Unreal Developer. now. but I realize this is an important

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
thing and thank you. Okiliy Dokily. for suggesting it.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now. I've realized that the best way to get it done. is actually to had it

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
over to you guys. So. somebody

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
one of you out there. at least one of you. is going to make an Assets Store

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
asset. on the Unity Assets

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Store. which means signing up for an account.

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
setting up everything you need to set up. including the graphics

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and the description and the instructions. and to make a simple

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Health Bar Prefab. Now. it's entirely of coarse up to you how you

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
do it. and you can even charge for hit and you may make some money from it.

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which would be great. But the sort of thing I've got in mind is very simple.

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's a component that will sit on a game

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
object. and look for the game object's transform component.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and on your little component.

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I imagine a couple of things. I imagine the ability to

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
offset this little health bar by

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
X and Y amount. from the transform of the object in

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
question. So. imagine we're now in Glitch Garden.

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and you want to put little tiny health bars on all the guys. I would

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
suggest a really simple health bar. without even an outline.

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Just a rectangle. that when it's not

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
full. just disappears. because if you put an outline

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
you're straight away into scaling issues. There's a big difference between how

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
it'll look. if it's just a few pixels by a few pixels verses

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
quite large. So. as a first approximation.

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
just grab yourself a rectangle. literally that just

35
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
disappears and depletes. And

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I would probably simply have four settings X

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
offset. Y offset from the transform of the

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
object that it's attached to. and then X scale and Y

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
scale. And then. you need to figure out for yourself a very

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
easy way for the developer to wire it

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in to a value of relevance. So. in Block

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Breaker. that could be the times hit. and it may just drop down three

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
times. two times. one time. and destroyed. If it was

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Laser Defender. then

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you may be talking about some other floating

46
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
point that changing. If it's Glitch Garden. the same sort of

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
thing. OK. so you've got to provide some simple interface.

48
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
some instructions in your package. to say to people

49
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this is the value that you need to talk to. So. you either need to make

50
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
changes to the existing code. you probably will have

51
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to make changes to the existing code of the game. or the

52
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
user of this package will. because if you've made your health

53
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
private. for example. on the component

54
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of the player or the brick or the zombie

55
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or whatever it is. then you can't reference that from the

56
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
outside right. So. you are going to have to go in and probably make a call into

57
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the Health Bar Prefab. and say just set the Health Bar

58
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Prefab's value to X. So. I leave all of that for you to work

59
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
out. It's a pretty simple assignment. if you're going to make your

60
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
first Unity Asset Store asset. which is of course. one of

61
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the wonderful things you can now do. given what you've learned

62
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
in this course. This would be a great and simple place to

63
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
start. A little bit of the problem is engineering. Please

64
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
please please keep it simple. And a large part of it will be.

65
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
how do you get that through Unity's approval and

66
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
provide all the relevant graphics. at the right sizes

67
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and dimensions that they want and provide a description

68
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and provide enough instructions that you

69
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
or me or one of the other students on the course. can

70
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
take the link the. which you're going to share. which will be the link to the actual Unity

71
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Asset Store asset. and try it in at least Block

72
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Breaker. Laser Defender. and Glitch Garden. In all

73
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
three of those games. I'd like to be able to drop your Health Bar Prefab

74
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
straight onto. or at least the

75
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
component. straight onto the bricks or the zombie

76
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
player and actually have it work. following some simple instructions.

77
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So. there you go! There's the gauntlet to you guys! I think the

78
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
spec is pretty clear. left and right offset. up and down

79
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
offset. vertical and horizontal size. and then. be

80
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
able to take a floating point value. that determine how full this little

81
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
bar is. I'll leave it to you. how you draw the bar. A UI slider maybe?

82
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Maybe you just draw some other and go for it!

83
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
See if you can make the Unity Asset Store asset. that is usable

84
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for all of us. and the person that makes the

85
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
first one that's on the asset store. that I can put

86
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
my idiot cap on and simply install in those games. I will then

87
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
add to this lecture we're on now. and I'll add it as a

88
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
downloadable resource for everybody else to use. So. I'm handing it over to you guys.

89
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to help me out getting that done. but most crucially to give you the

90
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
confidence of launching a Unity Asset Store asset.

91
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So. good luck with that! I know one of you will do it. and you'll probably do it

92
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
surprisingly quickly and surprisingly well. knowing some of you guys!

93
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.433
And I'll see you soon!
