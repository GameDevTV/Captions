Do you want to bring your ideas to life, in the 3D

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
world? Hi, I'm Mikey! And I'm Ben!

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I've been teaching people, educating them,

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and reassuring them with technology, for the last 10 years.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I'm the coauthor of the Complete Unity

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Developer, which is the most successful game development course on

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Udemy, with over 15,000 very happy students,

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and I want to work with Michael to make an equally

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
amazing Blender course for you! So, what's Blender Mikey?

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, Blender is a wonderful 3D tool and animation

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
tool. If you've got a Mac or PC, you can start

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
using it immediately. And we're going to create a course from

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the very fundamentals, up to some much more complicated

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
stuff. So, where are we going to start? So, I think a good place to start

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
would be with a simple bowling pin and a bowling ball, something

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
just off geometric just a little bit

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
outside of what you could do in Unity, on it's own. And

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
then, move on from there to something slightly more complicated, like a

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
chess set. So, much more complicated, a few more

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
models a few more techniques to learn there, but that's getting

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
a bit boring, we need to add some movement into this. How are we going to do that?

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So, remember the little lamp in the films? I won't use any

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
brand names here, but he kind of looks around and kicks things around.

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That type of animation, with a nonliving object, but with all

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the animation principles is where we're going next. Moving from there,  we're

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
going to... make a cute little bunny! Aww! Yes!

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So, that's going to learn how you put

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
things together. It's called rigging, how the bones work in an

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
animal or creature, so you can control the animation with much more

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
fidelity. Absolutely! And use animation engines

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to help you animate those things. And then, finally the hardest thing

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to do, of course, is to make something that looks human like. And that's going to be our piÃ¨ce

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
de rÃ©sistance, is to bring that for you, because

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you're really going to have to bring all your skills together, to make something that looks even

35
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
remotely believable as a humanoid, which will be the final

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
type of character. We've also got ideas to include buildings

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and other types of models in the course, as per your

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
feedback, as this Kickstarter unfolds. So, Blender is

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
going to be a fantastic tool for you! It's going to be your gateway to 3D!

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We want to make this amazing course! We need the money so that Mikey can

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
quit his job and go 100% at this, and make this course

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
for you! So, back the project now, you won't be disappointed and we'll see you

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in the course! Take care!
