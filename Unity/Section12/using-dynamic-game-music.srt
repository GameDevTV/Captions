00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys and

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
welcome to our information interview on dynamic music.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
as promised in the Kickstarter. So. I'm Ben Tristem. as

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
you know. author of the Unity Developer course. and I'm with...

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Michael author of the Complete Blender course.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So Michael. you may not know. is also a talented

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
musician. a man of many talents. Thank you. He's been

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
playing the piano. since he was this big. So.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
for the concept of this discussion or for the scope of this discussion.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
what are we talking about? Well. we're going to be talking about dynamic music.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
specifically in Unity. but this applies to any game engine.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And we're just going to talk about the basics of it. which is the ability

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to change track and to change the

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
sound volume. So. we're going to assume you're allowed to play multiple different sound tracks.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There could be different pieces of music. could be different instruments. We'll talk

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
about that later. And we're going to assume you've got the ability to start and stop

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
pretty accurately. which you certainly have in Unity and Unreal and other engines.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we're going to assume that you can control

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the volume. with some finesse as well. So. that's what

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we're going to do. Why is it important? A couple

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
of reasons why. Mikey. why do we want to change music? Well. sounds incredibly

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
important throughout everything. If you imagine

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
any films you've seen. any moments of silence. Well. that silence

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
itself is a sound. There's a little tip for you.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But it's a soundtrack. whether it's music or a sound

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
effect. it's all the soundtrack for your game. for whatever

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
project you're working on. Now. sound is incredible.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
it can lead us up to an emotional state. I mean you

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
can have the same scene... Imagine some swings. swinging

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in a playground and playing happy

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
cheerful music. well it's a cheerful scene. You do the

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
same and put a bit of horror music in it. perhaps

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
even the same theme but a bit more discordant a bit

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
harmonics. You know it's horrible. slow. or echoey.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's something you've got horror. horror scene. To completely change the feeling of it. It's exactly

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the same sort of... Well. there's nothing changed

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
in the scene. only the music. and that can change what

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
you're feeling. massively. OK. to summarize it.

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
setting the mood and for non visual

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
cues as well. Important Yes. OK. so we're

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
going to run through with you. three specific examples

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and we're going to talk about how we may actually implement that.

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Yes. So number one. this is inspired by an experience

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
we both had recently. playing Until Dawn on the PS4.

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That's Until Dawn. it's a horror game interactive

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
horror. Pretty cool! And we just noticed. as we went to a doorway

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
boundary. and as we approach that doorway I think I'm not even

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
sure what happened. I know I felt uneasy but I think some strings maybe got  a lot

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
louder. Yes. so as we approached the door. it was leading us up.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It was saying. beyond this doorway and the closer and closer

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
you got the louder and more intense these strings became.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And I'm not sure if it made us jump afterwards.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but when we passed through the door it just went dead. Yeah. so there was a huge

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
amount of contrast there. So. let's talk briefly about how we might do that.

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So. a simple way to do this would be

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to have a AudioSource. in the doorway. just

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
say on the floor. just floating in the air. it's invisible who cares.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And then. you work on the Volume Rolloff Curve for

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that AudioSource. and arrange that when you get within a few feet or

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
meters of the door. that

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
an audio track... So. let's imagine you've got some discordant music of

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
some sort. running in the background. right. And then.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you could as a separate track. attach to this AudioSource a string.

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
some strings or something. You could just ramp up the volume.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It's very simple at this stage. just ramp up the volume as you get closer

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and closer to the door. In fact. you probably want it very subtle

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
as you approach the door. depending on the speed of your character and the distance

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
between it. But as you get closer and closer to the door. you

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
want it to ramp up to really make that doorway tense.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
OK cool! So. we're talking about two audio tracks here. One is

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
music that is

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
compatible with the idea of having louder and louder strings.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that plays through the whole room that we're in. and then.

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
another one. which is specifically a strings AudioSource.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that sits in the doorway. It just gets louder

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and louder as you approach. It's a 3D sound and the sound ramps up and

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
ramps up. as you get close to it. And you play test it. by walking up to the door and seeing how it

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
feels. And then. you said that in Until Dawn

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
you seem to remember it stopping very quickly. Yes. So.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
one way we could do that. in say Unity. is just to put a collider on just the other side of the door.

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
for example. a Trigger Collider. and then. wire that Trigger Collider to

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the AudioSource script and just say stop playing the sound. So. it gets

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
louder and louder and louder. and then. we walk through the door and it stops.

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Now. you either scare them at that point or whatever or you don't.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Or leave them hanging. But you've created the mood right.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So. hopefully that's clear. that particular scenario. Yeah.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Anything else to add on that one? Not really. I mean

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you can apply this to any sort of

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
context. whether you're approaching a base.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
if you've made a game. or approaching home. you can make it

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
triumphant. etc. So. you can use that sort of thing wherever you are.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
These are general geographic cues and

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
you can do this with your own scripting. but remember that most game engines have

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
a 3D AudioSource. Unity certainly does. that you can let

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
it do the calculations about how loud it is for the volume and you just move a curve.

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I guess the other thing I noticed when talking to you about this before

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
was that you said. because in the case of discordant

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
music. because the music is already discordant. it doesn't matter really what strings

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
sound you put on top. but in some cases you may need to match

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and get your music design or just listen to make sure that what you're

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
adding matches with the underlying sound track. Otherwise you end up with a

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
muddy mess and you do want to avoid that. And in the case

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
with sound. and probably most things. less is actually more.

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So. if you over complicate it. you end up with a muddy mess

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and essentially the character

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
or you as a player is just going to become confused.

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Fantastic! OK. in a moment we're going to move on to the second

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
example of what we can do with this sound.

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
OK. so for our second example we're just going to use the case of a

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
character drawing their sword. as simple as that.

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Or any weapon. So. talk us through what might be

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
happening there. Mikey. Before we draw the sword. what could be going on with the music?

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
If you imagine. let's take an RPG for example.

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
so you'll be trolling. strolling... [Laughs]

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Trolling. strolling. patrolling! [Laughs] ...strolling around the forrest

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
scene and you see a potential enemy. however. you may

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
have the calm music playing at the moment. You want something

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to trigger the sound change. and

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
one of the things. well if you've got your weapon out you're going to be attacking.

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so you can change from calm music

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to attacking music. more aggressive music. more exciting music.

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
the moment you have your weapon drawn. Fantastic! So in

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Unity for example. you could just do that straight from the Player Animation State.

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
You could say that it he's in a Weapon Ready State or in

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
a Weapon Ready Sub-State Machine

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
then that's the point at which a script triggers

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
a different music. Yes. we do obviously have to be careful. when

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
we change... You can just imagine someone going oh. the music

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
changes. Well. what happens if I do this?

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Of course. you do have to have some sort of Roll Off

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
with the music itself. You mean if you keep putting the music away.

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
the sword in and out. It's just going to sound silly if you do that. so you're going to have to

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
have some buffer that it's playing agressive

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
music for a while after...

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
That's a good idea. If you imagine your adrenaline. in reality. doesn't suddenly

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
disappear the moment you put the weapon away. you need to keep it tense for a

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
while. OK. so we get down to the

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
specifics for them of how this might work. then we'd have a

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
script that looks for a change in Animation State. In a particular Animation State

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
it would fade down the current music. over a

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
period of time in the script and then fade up the volume of the aggressive music

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and then play that for a certain amount of time.

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
either using a co-routine

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
or using an AudioSource that plays a sound

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
for a particular amount of time. There's ways of doing it. we're talking about sound design here

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
rather than specific implementation. but I think what Mikey is saying is if the

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
battle has ended or you put a sword away. we don't immediately trigger the

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
stop of that sound. that we let that sound play for a little bit

149
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
longer and then calm it down. probably slower than we ramped it up.

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So the volume. it comes in it fades in rapidly and

151
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
down slowly. And you can use that type of sound design. not only

152
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
when you're drawing a weapon but when. let's say. when an enemy spots you.

153
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So it's a good audio cue. that you're now

154
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
in danger but you don't know where from. So that would be

155
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
triggered off the AI's state. when you've come into his line of sight.

156
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Cool! So. so far we've had number one's

157
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Geographic Triggers. like in the Until Dawn example on the

158
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Micro Scale a doorway. on the Macro Scale you mentioned approaching a base.

159
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The second idea we've had is based on states. state of view. state of the game.

160
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
state of an enemy. could even be the state of a video camera.

161
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you know. A very strong example is Metal Gear Solid. when

162
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
somebody recognizes you it goes ding. it makes this kind rrrah sound and there's an

163
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
exclamation mark. and you know for sure that somebody has spotted you. That's

164
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
a sound effect more than music. but they kind of tie together.

165
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
OK fantastic. that's the second one. So. in a moment we'll explore a third

166
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
way that we can dive into using dynamic music in our games.

167
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
OK guys. let's

168
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
talk about the third way that we could possibly use dynamic music in our games. So.

169
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
at this instance it's going to be much longer term. timewise.

170
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Yes. So. what are we thinking here. Mikey?

171
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Again. I'm going to use RPG because it really works in this

172
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
context. So. if you imagine good and evil.

173
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
the more good you do in the game. perhaps the music itself

174
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
gets more angelic. so to speak. I don't know how that would

175
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
sound. you'd have to play about with your game itself.

176
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
but as you became bad. let's say if you stole stuff.

177
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
if you killed innocents. etc.. etc..  you would

178
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
end up with more devilish music.

179
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The overall soundtrack changes the mood of the character...

180
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Over a longer period. Yes. over a much longer period

181
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
of the game. In fact. you could script over the entire game.

182
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
OK. Then. you'd have. let's say. you'd have

183
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
five states. one being neutral. two pluses. and two

184
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
negatives. So. you're neutral or you're slightly good or your've very

185
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
good guy or you're slightly bad guy or really bad guy. Exactly. Yeah.

186
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And you could have. for simplicity. five tracks

187
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
on each layer. and as every so

188
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
often I suppose you'd call... So. there's tracks on each layer. Let's just make sure it's

189
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
clear for the... like a playlist. Yeah. a playlist. So. we would pick a

190
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
neutral guy playlist of five. ten. fifteen songs.

191
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
If all the time the guy stays neutral. it just plays the songs back

192
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
to back. They fade down they fade up. like normal songs do. but

193
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
at the end of each song. perhaps. is a good time for a script

194
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
to say. let's check in at the character's good or badness level

195
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and change lanes right? Yes. so you can go down or go up.

196
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Switch into another playlist between songs. I think even

197
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
if they've been really really bad recently and their thing has gone

198
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
right down. you still don't jump two lanes. you still step down

199
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and then step down again. otherwise it would be too

200
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
much of a sound change. Of a contrast for such a long

201
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
term play. That's a good point. So. you could say right I'm at level 0.

202
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
say we have -2. -1. 0. +1. +2. I'm at 0

203
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I'm playing a track. but during that track the player has been

204
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
so evil that he's gone 0 to -2. but you just

205
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
say let's just move down 1. Write a little bit of script that says move

206
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
down one at a time. and then. when we check at the end of this song. if he's still

207
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
-2 well then we'll go down to the -2 sound. Yeah definitely. And the will give a

208
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
nice slow. long term sense of

209
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
a change in the mood. based on the character.

210
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Fantastic! So. we would select those playlists that

211
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
work in their own right. so you could listen to

212
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
+2 guy. super good guy. all day on a loop.

213
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
One great example of this is Oblivion.

214
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I mean it doesn't do the good bad guy changes. but

215
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
when you're exploring the world it has very

216
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
gentle music. etc. When you're in a

217
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
fight. etc. it changes. but you could apply that

218
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
same methodology to the actual character themselves.

219
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Just change that background music as you go.

220
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So. there are three clear strategies for you guys. as to how to

221
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
think about implementing Dynamic Music in your game. So. I want you to pick

222
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
a game you're working on or you have worked on and go

223
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
with one of these strategies. Either put in some dynamic music

224
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
based on state. or put some

225
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
long term dynamic music based on the kind of mood of the

226
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
game. where the theme changes much more slowly over a period many

227
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
minutes. Please implement one of those. share what you've got in the discussions

228
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
against this video. And all that remains to say is

229
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
if you want more Mikey. and who wouldn't want more Mikey. [Laughs]

230
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
then. go check out the Complete Blender Creator course.

231
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Over on Udemy it's udemy.com/blendertutorial

232
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
blendertutorial... www.udemy.com/blendertutorial

233
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and that is how to make 3D assets in Blender.

234
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And if you want to know more about what we're talkng about here. which is sound and music

235
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
of course. then I'm going to give you a link down here to a

236
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Trello card on my Course Roadmap. Now. I have a card

237
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
on there for a music course. that I would co-author with Mikey. It's

238
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
not going to happen till 2016. quarter 2

239
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
quarter 3 at the earliest. but if you are interested in learning more

240
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
about dynamic music and actually building it into games. please vote

241
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
on that card. It may change names. as we come up with the idea. but just give it

242
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
a vote. Log into Trello. give it a vote. and thank you for

243
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
lisetning! I hope you've enjoyed this interview. and we'll see you soon! Take

244
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.533
care guys!
