00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So. how did you get on with the

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
huge challenge of turning what I've shown you. and everything else

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in this course. into your own multiplayer game?

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now. I'd expect that challenge to take days and weeks. not just

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
hours. So. I hope you've done it. I hope you're

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
doing well. Let us know in the discussion where you're

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
stuck. I would say right now. that if I see a recurring

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
theme come up. where you don't feel you're fully equippedt to make a game.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
then I will add to the section. because of course. I'm committed for the long

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
term to maintaining this course. and the Physics course. and the Blender

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
course. and any other courses I've made. It's my job

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to keep those up to date. keep them fresh. so that includes adding

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to this section. as and if required. But what I'm going

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
for here is a tapered structure. so the very early sections

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of the course are very small. and then. they got bigger and bigger and  bigger.

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
culminating with Glitch Garden and Bowl Master; very

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
large sections and then we taped down again. Zombie Runner was a little

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
bit incomplete. Twin Sticks was very incomplete. and this

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
section is purposefully also incomplete and really

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
focusing on the core knowledge that you need to make multiplayer games.

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so that you can use everything you learned previously in the course.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to turn it into real games. Now. you're going to need this sort of

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
independence. when you're working for yourself

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and you're making your own games. of course. Somebody is not going to be there. to tell you

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
how to make every aspect of it. So. please persist.

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
please keep learning. keep exploring. keep supporting

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
each other. and see if you can't make your own multiplayer

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
networking game. and ship it into the Assets Store. At least.

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a local multiplayer game. just with what you've learned. Let me

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
know how you get on. in the discussions. and I will see

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
you in the Final Section. where there are fewer extra resources.

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and of course on with my other courses.
