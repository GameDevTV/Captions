00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey hey! So now. we're going to be talking about deploying our game

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
locally. that is how to deploy the same version of the game

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
into two machines. Of course. you could use Version Control.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
such as GIT or SVN. You could use a shared folder.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you could setup DropBox sync between two PC's.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's what I'm going to be doing. I'm going to be using DropBox.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but the thing to remember is to be careful to just have

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
one master. We're going to make all our changes on one machine

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or in just the Unity Editor. which will also be the Host

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Machine. and then. we're going to push those changes either to

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
your Local Build or using one of the methods I just mentioned

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
over to the other machine. So. as a

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
quite summary of what I just said. this is what we're going to be doing in this video.

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So. remembering this diagram from the

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
last section or the last video. we're going

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to be using the right hand column. the two PC scenario.

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but what we didn't talk about yet is how we're going to get the file

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
from the Host. the Mac. to

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the PC. the Client in my case. You might be using a different

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
combination. of course. you might be using two Macs or two PC's or

21
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
whatever. But we're going to be developing on the Host Machine.

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and then. we need to push a version of the game over to the

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Client. that's exactly the same. so that all of the

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
resources and all of the assets. everything must match.

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Just like when you're playing a multiplayer game with other people. you

26
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
need to make sure you have the same version of the game. So. I'm going to

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
talk about how we're going to do that! I'm opting

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to use DropBox. but as I said

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in the overview. there are other options. You could use Version

30
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Control. such as GIT or SVN. etc.. and then. check

31
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in and check out on the other machine. You could use a shared

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
folder or a network drive. but the important thing is

33
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that you make all your changes on your master. the machine you're coding on.

34
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
which will also be the Host and then that you are

35
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
aware of when those changes propagate over to the Client

36
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Machine. So. I'm going to use DropBox for this. so let's see

37
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
how I do that. So. here in Unity I'm going to quit. make sure

38
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Unity is fully closed. before I go and move it's project folder.

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then. I'm going to go and find it's Project Folder. Now. in my case. that's

40
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in Repos. UnityCourse. 11 Ahoy Matey.

41
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
There it is! OK. and I'm going to move that project folder.

42
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
simply move it into DropBox. So. there it is!

43
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now. it is in DropBox now. Ahoy Matey.

44
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and it is syncing. If we look at the DropBox Sync Client. it says downloading

45
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the files list and various other things.

46
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but you can see that there's a logo here that suggests it's still syncing.

47
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So. before I go over to the PC. I want to

48
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
check a setting. I want you to go into Preferences of DropBox. if you're using DropBox.

49
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and just make sure under Network that LAN Sync is on.

50
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
on both machines both PC's both Macs. both machines.

51
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because that will allow the files to not only

52
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
be sent up to the web but to be synced over the network.

53
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now. I actually have this under Version Control. all this stuff.

54
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
there is a GIT repository here as well. and it's not the best

55
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
idea to have a GIT repository also in DropBox but I've done some testing and

56
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
it seems to work fine. So. we're just using DropBox to get this

57
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
file from the PC here. and the Mac rather. over to the PC.

58
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So here I am. on the PC! Ooh! Hah! Two sets of

59
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Start Menus. let's try and get the PC Start Menu.

60
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It's going to be tricky. this is going to be fun! OK. so there we

61
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
go! Maybe I'll put the PC's Menu along the side of the screen. for

62
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
future videos. You can see on the PC that the DropBox is still

63
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
syncing. Remember on your PC to check

64
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the DropBox settings. to make sure that you actually have your

65
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
LAN Sync enabled on the PC as well.

66
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So. that would be over here on a PC. if you're using DropBox

67
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Preferences. and I'm not sure

68
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
where. Probably Band Width and then Enable LAN

69
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Sync. There you go. that's the PC! Perfect! So. once this

70
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
is finished. we can have the project

71
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
open on both machines. So. I'm going to go to the Mac and just open

72
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it on the Mac first. I've got a Game.unity file.

73
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So you. as a minimum. need to just have an empty scene with

74
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
the name and that's what I want you to sync across.

75
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So. I've got this thing called Game here.

76
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And what I'm going to do is wait over on the PC for the DropBox

77
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
sync to finish. it shouldn't be very long. Then. open the project.

78
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
There you go. it's finished! Assets. Game.

79
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and here comes Unity. opening up obediently

80
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for us. and we see the same thing! Great!

81
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So. we have the same file

82
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
on both machines. the same Unity Project. Let's try just adding something.

83
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You don't necessarily need to follow along with this right now.

84
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
by the way. you can just watch me. I'm going to give you a challenge to do

85
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
all this. in just a moment or to catch up. So.

86
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm going to put a cube at the origin. quite simply. in my

87
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
project over on my Host my Mac. I'm going to save it to the disk.

88
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the little dot has gone away. I'm going to go back

89
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
to the PC and see what happens.

90
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So. Unity is quite good at detecting

91
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
changes in the File System and actually updating the project.

92
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So. if we watch over here in DropBox.

93
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
we should find that this syncs through

94
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and changes. Let's see how DropBox is doing. OK.

95
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
there you go! Unity says "The open scene has been modified"

96
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
reload. And that's fine. there's our cube! You see

97
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
what I've done there? I've just added a cube on the Mac.. it is saved to the File

98
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
System. DropBox has synced it across. or you could use your shared

99
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
folder or you could make a commit. and here over on the

100
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
PC or my Client version. the cube has

101
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
appeared. So. what I want you to do now is. simply to make sure this is

102
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
all working for you. I want you to get your Client copy working. Setup your Client.

103
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
this can be a build or a different machine.

104
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
If you're going to do a build. then I'll show you that in the solution

105
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
briefly. And then. add a second cube to the scene and check that

106
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
this change propagates to the Client.

107
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So go ahead. pause the video. and make sure you can propagate changes

108
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
to your Client version.

109
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Cool! Welcome back! So. let's just check this. I'm very confident this

110
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
will work. so let's just add another cube. It can

111
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
be maybe at a position of. I don't know. maybe

112
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
two meters away three meters away? That'll do! As long

113
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
as I save to the disk and then go back to the PC and wait.

114
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We're waiting firstly for the Host Machine. the

115
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Mac in my case. to upload to DropBox. Now. it

116
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
doesn't have to get the file entirely to the web. because LAN

117
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Sync is on. Hopefully it will come across the LAN quicker.

118
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And then. in a moment. it'll arrive

119
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
on the PC. then Unity will go hey. something about this file

120
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
has changed. It's important that you don't change anything on the

121
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Client version. we just do testing on the Client.

122
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You do all you're coding over here. on the Host

123
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Machine. that's really important! So there's a one way flow of

124
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
file information and game distribution. if you like. from the

125
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Host to the Client. So.

126
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
is this going to notice the change? It should do it

127
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in a moment.

128
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Try playing. see if that knocks it

129
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
into noticing. No. So. if you're not sure. of course. you can check the

130
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
status of the DropBox sync here.

131
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Here it is! I have ticks. I'm

132
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
not seeing any changes. So. this could... There you go!

133
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So. I don't know whether looking at the file prompted it

134
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to action or whether it was just time. I think it was just time!

135
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Great! So. you may be better off using a shared folder. for example.

136
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Well. that's another option for you. So. we're in sync.

137
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that's fantastic! What's this business about working into a build?

138
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Let's just try that! Let's make a build

139
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and we'd add the current scene and it'd be a Mac PC Standalone.

140
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
for example. And I could make a folder

141
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
called Builds and I could call it Mac.

142
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
just Mac

143
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
or Ahoy Matey

144
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Mac. There you go!

145
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So. in this case. if you're going to be working to a

146
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Local Build. then clearly

147
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
anything that you do when you do the build will

148
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
arrive in the build. right. So anything I've done to this

149
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
scene. after I've said build. will

150
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
go over to the Build Folder and work. So. if I now go and run this

151
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Ahoy Matey Mac. at any resolution.

152
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Then. I need to just get this on a different screen.

153
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
That'll be a second.

154
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Let's try again! Ahoy Matey Mac.

155
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Windowed.

156
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and that allows me to bring this down. "made with Unity".

157
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And of course. there is my scene.

158
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
only in Game View of course. So now. if you were to make

159
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
another change. over in your Host. like say delete this cube.

160
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
which I'm going to do anyways. so go ahead and delete your second

161
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
cube. Then. of course the way that

162
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
you get that to your Client. if you're using this way of working. is

163
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
simply Build & Run again. and then. you create

164
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
a new Client. without the cube.

165
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Alright. which stands to reason. So then. your build goes away.

166
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and when you rerun it

167
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
of course. the cube isn't there. which is

168
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
fairly obvious that if you rebuild the game without the cube. I just

169
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
want to make you realize that these two things are equivalent . I'm going

170
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
to be working Unity Editor to Unity Editor.

171
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
because that is much quicker and easier than constantly building. so I'll be

172
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
working from here. over to the PC. Talking about the PC is

173
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the final thing. before I go away. I want to make sure that now that I've saved

174
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
this. Have I saved it? I have now! On the

175
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Mac. I want to make sure that change propagates to the PC. without me

176
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
doing anything. I'm just going to take my hands off and let that happen.

177
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
In the mean while. get your environment all setup.

178
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and make sure that you can effectively deploy your game. That's what we're doing

179
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
here. we're just manually deploying our game for testing purposes.

180
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
so that we have the same thing on the Mac and the PC or the Host

181
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and the Client. You may wonder why it matters that we

182
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
have the same thing. The reason is that in a multiplayer

183
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
game. the assets aren't actually pushed over the Network.

184
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
so if you have some complicated animation or music

185
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
or anything like that. they're not pushed over the Network. They need to be

186
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
available in both copies of the game. which is why

187
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
two discs when you buy a PS4 game. for example. have

188
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
you know the same amount of stuff on them. It's not as if you host the

189
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
game and you send all the assets streaming down the network. it doesn't work like that.

190
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
What you do is you send Network ID's. which we'll

191
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
find out about later. streaming down the network.

192
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and those Network ID's tell the Client.

193
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
this thing over here on the PC. what assets to load

194
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
into the game. So. that's why we need to have an

195
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
identical copy of the game on both machines. It

196
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
means that we can send just information about how things are changing. down the

197
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
network. not the whole lot. So. I've talked

198
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
about that for a while. and the Unity over on the PC

199
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
still hasn't updated. so something has

200
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
to kick this into action. by the looks of it. It seems that just

201
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
going to the folder on the PC and just having a look at it.

202
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
seems to kick DropBox or Unity into

203
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
action there. So. maybe you have that quirk as well.

204
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that you just need to go and have a look at the folder. I don't know

205
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
perhaps that's what you need to do. So. that's it! Hopefully you're

206
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
up and running! Share in the comments to say. yep I've got it working.

207
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and I can deploy a version between two machines. And then. we'll crack on

208
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
with actually making behavior work over the network! See you

209
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.200
soon!
