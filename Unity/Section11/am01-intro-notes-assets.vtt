00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Arrr! And welcome to this here

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
pirate infested Multiplayer Networking section!

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And for those of you, who don't speak English, arrr

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and welcome to this here pirate infested Multiplayer Networking

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
section. So, Ben here! Of course firstly, I

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
have the beard, just to set the pirate culture for

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
this multiplayer section. So congratulations

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
on getting this far in the course, is the first thing to say! You're

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
one of very few who have actually made it through all 50 odd

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
hours, to this point. It shows how committed you are, so press

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
on and well done. Seriously! That's a lot

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of work, and I'm really impressed. So, I want to tell you what we are

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and what are not going to be covering in this section. It's another very

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
simple cut down section, like Twin Stick. The idea is that I

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
give you the nucleus of knowledge that you need to

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
go off and make a game. If I was to build this into a full game, not

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
only would I use a huge amount of your time, but

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I would be repeating a lot of what you've already learned in the

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
rest of this course. So, what I'm doing is showing you

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the essence of what you need to do, in order to make

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Multiplayer Networking. You can do this with just

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
one PC. I'm doing it on two, I'm using a Mac

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and then I'm using a PC next door. But there's  a couple of ways you can do it

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
on one computer. At firstly, you can just operate to a

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
local build, so build yourself a Mac or PC

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
standalone version and then do multiplayer

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
against that. I've done that in the course and it works just fine.

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The other thing that you could do is use a Virtual Machine,

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and run Windows or run a different machine inside a Virtual Machine,

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for example. Or you can just have a

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
separate physical computer or you can go to a mobile device, so

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
lots of options. We'll be using Unity Networking

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
throughout, all the Unity 5. Unity 5.2

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
actually, I'm using but anything

35
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Unity 5.2 or above will work just fine.

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We'll be in local Multiplayer Networking only. It's a relatively

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
simple job, to read the docs and workout how to go beyond that,

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
into Online Multiplayer Networking, using Unity Accounts,

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but we'll keep it simple and keep you away from needing to do

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that in this section. What else to say? Attached to this

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
video are the section notes. That's a .pdf, please

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
take those and annotate them in a .pdf reader or print

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
them out, if you must. And also attached are some fantastic assets.

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now look, thank you to Marco Veil, one of our students, for creating

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
this ship. He's created it, he's textured it,

46
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
he's rigged it, he's created animations for you, and he's even

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
provided you with an optional sea surface texture, with a very clever way

48
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of making it shimmer. So that's it, dive into the section!

49
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I think you're going to enjoy it! There's some fascinating and interesting things

50
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that we have to solve with Multiplayer Networking, and I'll see you soon!
