00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys welcome back! So. in this video we're going to make

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
our own Start Host Button. something like this.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And that is going to be wired through. to our own methods against Network

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Manager and allow us to start the host and get a log

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the Console. without needing the ugly

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
default HUD Component. that kind of works

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
magically without us knowing what it does. So. that's what we're

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
going to be doing. We'll also have a quick look at the API documentation

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of a couple of methods. OK. so that's

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
what we do. So the reason we want to

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
replace this default HUD is. because we don't really know what it

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is doing. We click a button and stuff happens. but

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that's not great. How about if we want our own User Interface.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
how are we going to get behind the skin of that button? If we try and inspect the button.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
then there's no information really.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and you can do some offsetting on it. You can say GUI

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Vertical and Horizontal offset and some other runtime

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
controls. which are just a repeat of these buttons. like LAN

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and Host. etc. But it's really not very

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
helpful. and if you try and search to see if we've got a HUD script

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
we can inspect. we haven't even got a HUD Script we can

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
inspect. So look. we need to get under the skin of this guy and start

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
creating our own functionality.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Initially. for this video. just getting the Start Host Button working.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and then from there. its an easy job to add other buttons as

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
we need to. So. what we want to do is just

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
create a button to start with. so I'm just going to add a UI Button.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and that will bring all the normal stuff with it. the Event System and the

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Canvas. of course. And I'm just going to call that button Start Host.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And give it a label

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of Start Host. of course. which is in the Text Element. all standard stuff

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
alright. We'll leave it a screen space for the moment.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The idea is that we just have a button. I will get it as

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
2D. pop into the UI Control.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
zoom to the Canvas. and then. move the button into the

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Canvas carefully. up there

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
on the top right to differentiate it. So now. if we click play.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
obviously our Start Host does nothing. because it's not wired to

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to do anything. So. the question comes. how do we even begin to find out what

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
methods to call to start this host. Well. I think a good old

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Google search will be good again: "unity network manager start host".

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and this is looking pretty promising. NetworkManager.StartHost

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
there. Alright. so that

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is what we are dealing with. the NetworkManager.StartHost.

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I am going to suggest a slight

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
architectural addition. and then. I'm going to challenge you actually

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
get the host starting. from the button. So. the thing that I want

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to do to make that possible is.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to have a script of my

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
own. my own NetworkManager. which is going to allow

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
me to actually make a

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
call from this button. Remember how buttons work. if we go to the button.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
come down here. and say On Click (). it's going to want an

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
instantiated object to call alright. So

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
we can talk to the NetworkManager here. but you'll find that if

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you look at NetworkManager and

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
inspect it. you don't have Start

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Host. it's just not an option. You've got Stop Host but not

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Start Host. so you can't even call the existing

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
NetworkManager. because for some reason they haven't publicly exposed the

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Start Host method. Now. that may change in the future. but that's how it is right

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
now. It's not available by the Network HUD either.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
so we need to create ourselves an interface

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
in between the two. So. back at the NetworkManager.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
instead of using a NetworkManager HUD Script. I want you to remove

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the NetworkManager HUB Component off your NetworkManager.

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Alright. so we've just got a NetworkManager on there.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
so this thing is really of type NetworkManger now.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
among other types like transform. Now.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
what I want to do is just make my own MyNetwork

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Manager or MyHUD for now

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Let's just call it my HUD. So. create a script called MyHUD.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Alright. and that's attached to the NetworkManager

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and let's pop into that script.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And I'm going to set you a challenge. of course. because

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I think that you can manage this bit.

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So. what I want you to do is make the button start the Host.

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
in MyStartHost() method in

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that script we just created. Start the Host and log to the Console.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
with a meaningful time stamp. OK so. you're going to click the

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
button. wire it up. call my start. call the appropriate

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
method. which I showed you in Unity's docs earlier. the NetworkManager.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
StartHost. and then make sure the Host actually starts from your button.

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The more experienced among you. may have noticed that we are

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
inheriting. in our script. from MonoBehavior by default.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and maybe that's not what we want to do but for now. just leave

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it inheriting from MonoBehaviour. Follow along with me. just for this video.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and in the next video I'm going to talk about override and

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
other things that are going to get the structure of this right. I just want to

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
take people down the path they're likely to go down. on their

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
own to start with. So. go ahead. pause the video. and

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
do that now!

93
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Welcome back guys! So. let's have a look at how

94
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we're going to do this! We have a my HUD Script.

95
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
which is just loading up in Mono now. Here it comes.

96
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
on the other screen. Fantastic! So. the first thing we're going to need to do is go and

97
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
find ourselves the NetworkManager. I want to do this privately. I

98
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
don't want to drag it in. This is something we don't want the designer doing. so

99
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
we have a private NetworkManager.

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Now. it's not there! The name space you're going to need to import

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is UnityEngine.

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Networking; now. you'll have a Network

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Manager.

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
There we go! So. private Network

105
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Manager networkManager; OK. and then the

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
standard old stuff. for us to go find it. So. networkManager

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
= GetComponent.

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Now. we can just GetComponent. in this point

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
because it's on the same GameObject right. We are

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
sitting here. MyHUD Script. it's

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
on the same GameObject. If we want our HUD Controller.

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
for some reason. to go on a different GameObject. which we might do later. we'd use a different

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
find method. we'd find object of type. If we're going to GetComponent

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of type <NetworkManager>

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and that's it! Now.

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I'm going to provide a method. I said in the challenge that we want

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
a method called void.

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
oops! MyStartHost

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
returning nothing. What's it going to do? Well. it's

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
just going to go NetworkManager the instance dot start

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Host. Now you see that's the

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
autocomplete. on my system at least. here in Mono. It may be

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
different in Visual Studio for you and it may be different in the future. but look. if I go start

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
it's not there. So. you have to confidently continue to

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
startHost. Alright. that's great!

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And then. what I want to do is Debug.Log

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
("Starting

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
host at...

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I'll put a capital H. why not. ...Host at " and then

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I'm going to concatenate it in Time.time since level load.

131
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Fantastic! And then. there's also

132
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
a method or message rather that is passed.

133
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
when the Host actually starts. Let's go to the docs and have a look.

134
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So. you've got StartHost. If we go back up to Network

135
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Manager. script reference NetworkManager.

136
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
let's see what we've got under Host. We've got a whole

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Host. excuse the thing there the pun. there

138
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
of things mentioning Host here. and then. we have OnStart

139
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Host hook or message. So. I'm going to just

140
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
intercept that OnStartHost. void OnStart

141
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Host. Normally. you'd cut and paste those. be very careful that you

142
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
spell it right. If you're not sure. just cut and paste from the docs.

143
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
because message is no error. but be careful of your syntax.

144
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And we're just going to Debug.

145
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Log ("Host

146
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
started at " and then

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
just put in this Time.timeSinceLevelLoad):

148
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
OK. let's see how all that works! Let's go into

149
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Unity. let's play. and when we

150
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
play. of course. there's not heads up display on the left anymore. because we

151
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
disabled the component. If we click Start Host and

152
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
look in the Console. what happens? Nothing! Why not?

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Simply because I haven't wired this button to any method. So.

154
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
the object I want to operate on is the NetworkManager.

155
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
but the function I want to find is MyHUD

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and then Start Host. Now. it's not there!

157
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Final rookie error. of course. is that this needs to be

158
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
public void Start Host. Save that script. back in

159
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
here. Now. when we inspect through

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
to here. we've got MyStartHost.

161
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Now. why did I call it MyStartHost?

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
That's OK! The reason I called it

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
MyStartHost was to differentiate it from the built in method.

164
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
so that we're clear that it's me then going on to call

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
the Start Host. Fantastic! So. we're looking

166
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
at the NetworkManager. this instance here. We're looking through

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the NetworkManager to the MyHUD Component.

168
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and then. we're calling MyStartHost. with no parameters. See

169
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
if it works! Ah hah! "Starting Host at

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
1" second .3333. You'll notice that we

171
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
are not seeing our other log entry.

172
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
which if we pop back into MonoDevelop. If I can

173
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
find it. somewhere along here. This On

174
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
StartHost has not worked. Now. that's going to be the

175
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
subject of the next lecture. because for the first time we're needing to do

176
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
something called an override. So. we'll talk about what overriding

177
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
is in the next lecture. So congratulations if you got this far! At

178
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
least you've got your Host starting. with your own button! And we will explore

179
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
what we need to do next!
