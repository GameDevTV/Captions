00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey! So, this is Game Design Document Creation!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this video, we're going to create a simple G.D.D.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
live, together. We're going to write

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a paragraph, explaining the game concept.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We will list the major game rules,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
define the asset requirements, and then

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
finally think about how we might monetize the game.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hey guys! So, I want to show you how I

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
actually come up with concept rules and requirements, live as we go. So,

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you're actually watching me edit the slides, that will end up

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in the Slide Deck here. So, this is the same section

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
notes or section slides, as you all have downloaded off

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the previous video, off the first video in the section.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So, the concept, what is a game concept?

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well, it's just a paragraph describing what it is. Try firstly,

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and sum it up in 5 words. So, in this case, it could be a

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
point and click. We're going to leave the word

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
A out, because it's a bit wasteful of my 5 words.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
A ship game. OK, well that doesn't tell you much, but it gets you off the ground.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It helps people silo it in their mind. It's a point and click ship

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
game. So, we're going to be

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
an isometric, which is the view,

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
multi-

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
player, including

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
a cross platform...

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And something like

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the idea is

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to become

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
king of the seas,

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
by defeating enemy

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
pirate ships or something like that. Nice and simple! Let's

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
move on for now, that's enough. You've jotted down the concept, you're going to refine

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
this later, as you go in your game, so I just want you to jot something

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
down. So, what are the rules? Well, this is where you start to flesh out

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
how it may actually work. So, we could say that

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
"You start with 100 health."

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
...

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the shooting... "Getting shot

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
reduces health."

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Simple stuff. And then, you might want to say something like

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
hitting a land

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
mass kills you instantly.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But think about that. If it's a point

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and click game and the AI

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
pathfinding is going to make us path-find around land masses,

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
then hitting a land mass and killing you is something the you don't

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
have control or agency over, so you actually don't want to make

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that part of this game. So, I'm going to reduce that

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
requirement, and then, I'm going to say something like

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
"Move...

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
"Move in range of

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
other ships, to shoot them."

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
"No win condition,

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
...

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Well, better say what happens if you... So, "You score

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
for killing

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the enemy." You could say

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
"You lose score

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
for being killed."

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
OK

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
sounding a bit boring. So, perhaps we

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
want to introduce a requirement that the guns can

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
only fire sideways. So, "Guns can only

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
fire in 90 degree

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
arc, either side of ship."

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Now, you need to position yourself, side on to the other ship,

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and approach in such a way that you'll side on. That sounds

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a little bit better. So, there are some rough rules that could

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
lead to a fun game. So, what are the asset requirements?

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We will need an Animated Ship Asset, so

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
let's just put that down.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We seem to be missing a bullet here, so

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
it doesn't matter I'll let them in, in a minute.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
An animated ship. We're going to need the terrain,

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
with scattered

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
islands, mainly water.

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We're going to need sound effects for the

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
gun, for the hit,

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
maybe for sinking? And we're going to need background

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
music, and then, thinking to

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the beginning of the game, we're going to need a splash screen

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
image. And that's it for now!

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
That's all I can think of for now. And then you've got some idea of

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
who may be creating what. Is all you? Is it an artist whatever?

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Then, monetization! So, a million ways to monetize a game.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
In this case, we're not going to monetize it, so

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
this will be a free game,

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
designed to play with

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
our friends to learn

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
more about networking.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So, the only purpose of putting this down, is to give you some idea

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that you want to start thinking about monetization, in the long run.

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So, that's it! It's literally a question of a simple concept, some simple

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
rules, and some requirements, and

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
some notes on how you're going to do monetization. All of this would

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
obviously be expanded, as you build the game, but you just want to get

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
cracking with a very early prototype, that you can start to

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
show to people and see what the interest is.

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
That's it! In the next video, we will actually start building the project

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.700
and getting networking working!
