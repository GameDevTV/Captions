00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey. welcome back! So. in this video. we're going to use something called

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a Network Transform on our cube.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
one of these things. and it's going to allow us to actually send

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the movement of the cube across from the Host

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to the Client. So. I'm going to explain what a Network Transform does

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for us. I'm going to tell you about this network

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
identity thing that comes along. We're going to make movements travel over the Network.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
test it over the LAN. also. with

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a local build and optionally you can go off and try

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it to a mobile. on your network as well.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
OK. so to make this work. we're going to need something called a

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Network Transform. so go to your Cube on your

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Host Machine. in the primary version of the game. and then

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
look for a Network Transform.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
When you do that. it'll also add a Network Identity. so

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the Network Identity is an ID that allows

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the system. at either end of the game

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or any of the Clients. to access a particular

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
asset. in this case a cube by an ID.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So for example. you're playing Grand Theft

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Auto. and suddenly a brand new car you've never seen before

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
appears on the horizon. What's going on there is. that car asset

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
of course. is already on your game disc or in your game download. and

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it's an ID that is being passed over the network. to say that this

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
asset needs to be pulled from the Assets and

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
spawned. So. that's what the Network Identifier does; it allows you to

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
uniquely identify particular assets. So. adding it to the

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
cube here of course means. it will also be added over on the

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Client version. when it all updates.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Alright! And the other thing we're going to add is a Network Transform.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And what that does is. according to this rate that you set here...

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm going to set this to 10. so 10 times a second is going to send the

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
transform of this cube over the network to the

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Clients. Alright. so let's see if we can

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
make that work. By the way. I warn you that the player not having a material

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
on it is probably going to cause an error. but let's

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
let that error come up and solve it. when it comes up. Then. you'll have the experience

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to recognize that type of error. because it's not particularly

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
clear. when it does come up. So. let's go for it! Let's

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
add to the Cube. this Network Transform.

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
which will come with an identity. which is a dependency.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Save it. go over to our Client...

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I need to look at my Dropbox folders

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and make it sync. for some reason. which forces a reloading

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Unity. OK now. back to the Host!

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Let's get the Host up and running. so Start Host.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In fact. hang on stop! I am fed up with typing

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this network address. so in my very Network Manager.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
under Network Address. I'm just going to put the address

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of the Host. for myself. OK.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Over here. Network Manager. under

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Network Info. Just put it. save it again.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and then. let your client version refresh.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and then. in Network Manager you'll see that there's

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
a default address there. which means that when we start

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the Client. we will get

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that as a default address. So. I've started the Host.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Let's go over to the Client; you can click LAN

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Client now. and it'll have the address defaulted.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
OK. Now. the Client

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is connected. so the machines are talking to each other. What we need to do now is click

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Client Ready. OK. this means the Client is finished loading all its

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
assets and it's ready to go. There you go! So. you're seeing both the ugly player.

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
with no material. and the Cube. Let's move back over

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to the Host. We're going to go to Scene View and

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm going to try just translating that Cube.

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
OK. I can see that that's working. but you probably don't believe

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
me. so let me show you that's working. by doing a

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Split Screen. So. I'm going to make Team Viewer. rather than Full Screen.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm going to make it somewhat smaller. I will

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
make just the Game View visible.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
By the way. this machine is called Bertie. because I couldn't think of a better name when

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Windows surprised me. by asking me for a name. so

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
just in case you're wondering why you're seeing Bertie. So. what I have on the left

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is my Unity. On the

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Host. which is on a Mac. and on the right. we're Team Viewing into a

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
separate computer. a PC over on the network. Watch this!

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Wow! It's amazing. it's a miracle. it moves. and if we grab

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the Rotation Tool. then it's a little slow.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but Rotation works as well. So. that

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
is great news! We actually have movements

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
working over the network. which is really cool!

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So. I haven't actually seen

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
this error yet. so I'm going to leave that ugly

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
material-less player. until we see an error. but

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
at some point we'll probably get a complaint. about something not

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
being initialized or some prefab not being

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
available or something like that. And at that point. we can be on our guard

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to just give this player a material.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
OK cool! So. that's working! Now. what I want to do is try

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
doing it to a local build. so I'm going to leave that to you as a challenge.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And what I want you to do is test to a local build. Creat

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
a local build of your game. run this build as a Client.

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
ensure that movement works between the two on the same machine.

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and as a bonus. you can create a mobile build and try

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
building to that. as well. You can simultaneously have your cubes moving around

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
both. on the same machine. and another machine and

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
a mobile if you want. if you really want to go crazy. Have a go

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and I'll see you on the other side.

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Cool! Welcome back! So. let's make this

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
happen! It's simply a question of going to Build Settings.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
making sure that the scene is in there. building for Mac

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and Linux. and let's just build and run. Ahoy Matey Mac. I've

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
already built before. so I'm going to replace the Ahoy Matey Mac Build.

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
In your case. you may be on PC or Linux. Now. you probably

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
want to run it windowed and then just play. The resolution is

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
pretty irrelevant. Here it comes!

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So. what I want to do is run this as a Client. but not yet. let's get the

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Host going first. So. I'm going to make my

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
windows a little bit smaller so we can see what's going

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
on. And

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
let's run over here. It's setup as a

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Host. that's fine.

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I'm going to go to Scene View. with my cube selected.

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now. let's go back over here. set this guy up as a Client.

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and say Client ready. OK. so on the right hand side. you're seeing the local

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
build. On the left hand side. you're seeing the Host in the Unity Editor. Let's

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
move the cube and it works! Great! So. that's

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
challenge one done! How about if we wanted to continue

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to talk to the Client machine. over here on the

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
network. Let's try spooling that up. at the same time!

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
See if we can get two Clients coming in. at the same time. Let's launch a

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Client and say that we're ready. OK.

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Now. again I'm going to have to do some jiggery pokery. as

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
we call it. with the windows here. So.

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
what you've got now is. let's just maximize on

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the PC. on the Client. There you go! So. you have

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
PC down on the bottom right. you have a Local

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Native Mac Build. at the top

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
right of the screen. and on the left

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
hand side. we have the editor. Let's see if this works.

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Can't really see can we. because I've go too much stuff.

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Here you go. look at that! So. we now

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
have two Clients receiving the same information. one across the network.

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
one on the same machine. Pretty nifty hey! So. this

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
is what we covered in the video. and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
when we continue to build out our multiplayer game.
