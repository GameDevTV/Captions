
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey guys! So, in this video, we're going to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
talk through Unity's Network System concepts,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ask ourselves what's not fun about the current game, you can't even really call it

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a game at this stage, and then, I'm going to challenge you to make a basic game

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
from here. So, let's start off by having a

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
recap of what we're doing with the Network System concepts. So, you click that link,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you come to this page. So firstly,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we covered the concept of a Server and Host.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, remember that your Host contains the

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Local Client and the Server. Now, you could make a single

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
player game like this. If you're going to have a game that's both multiplayer

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and single player, this architecture of just running the

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Server locally is just fine, there's not too much of a performance

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
overhead of this. So, you can structure your

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
whole game like this, that you always have a Server running.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, that's what happens when we spin up a Host. And then,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we've also had a couple of remote clients haven't we? One was my

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
PC, over the Local Area Network, and the other was a

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
local build on the same computer, all

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
plugging into the Host, actually really plugging into the Server.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, there's that, hopefully that was clear for you.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And there's a lot more information on this page, obviously, I'm not going to

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
read it out to you, you can look for yourself. So, then

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the next concept was about Local Player Authority and players.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So, there's a box kind of

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
drawn around by the Client 1 and the Server, which together,

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
as per here, make the Host. So, Server and Local

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Client, in this diagram, relate to Server and Client 1.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, Player 1's transform changes are

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
sent up to the Server and then propagate down to

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Client 2. And then of course for Client 2,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Player 2 is set as the local player, and it

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
has authority, which means that changes made on Client 2 get

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
sent to the Server and then back down. We also had in our

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
scene a cube, which represents an enemy and

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that doesn't have any Local Player Authority, and all

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that happens there is that when the Server moves this

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Enemy, or the cube, then the transform

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
component, the Network Transform Component,

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
pushes that change down to both of the Clients.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So, hopefully this diagram now is a little bit clearer in as

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to who controls what. So, Player 1 has Local Player Authority,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
here, Player 2 here, and the Enemy up on the Server.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Again, some good information on this page. Don't let

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
yourselves get too confused by it, but reading through Unity's

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Networking over High Level API is a good idea,

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
in conjunction with doing the course, because it's going to help you.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
understand. So, where can we go from here with this

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
game and this section. Well, one of our students,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Marco Vale, has very kindly provided us with this

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
fantastic ship! Look he's created this, modeled it,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and animated it, and there are also several animation states.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, I left the cube in the just for posterity, but what I've

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
done here, as just an example for you, is I've grabbed a Sky-

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
box from the Assets Store. I've just said

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Skybox, and I've gone to Assets Store and looked

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
for a free Skybox.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Maybe you need one word, and I think the one I'm using

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
is WispySkybox, over here. So, I've imported a

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
free Skybox, which makes things look prettier. Now, I'm

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
for water using the same water as we used in Zombie Runner, which is the

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Water Pro Daytime Asset, from the Standard Environmental Pack.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And then, that gives you reflection and refraction, not that there's

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
anything to refract from under the water. And then,

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we have an Animation Machine, we have a Skybox,

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and then, you can decide what are you going to do with the game from here. Are we going to have a

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Top-Down Perspective, like this? And maybe be

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
right up in the sky and point and click around, to make these ships

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
move, or do you want more of a First Person Perspective? So,

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
before I go any further, and indeed if I go any

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
further, I want you to have a good go at using all of the knowledge you have,

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
from the courses so far, to now go and make

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
this work, because really this is the end of the course and you

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
are very able to produce a

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
huge amount yourself, and I want you to get confidence in that. So, we've

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
broken the back of the difficulties of Multi-Player,

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and you can see the process by which you go through and

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
work out, well how do I get the next thing working,

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you know? You're going to find that when you go to your

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
player and you start typing network in here,

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
some of these things are deprecated and it will say so if they are,

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and some of them aren't, like Network Animator, for example.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, you're going to need to use a few

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
more components, to transmit things like Animations

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
State, and if you want to do things like

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
match making, which we're not going to cover in

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
this course, because it's too advanced, then you're going to need a

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Network Matchmaking System, which is against the Network Manager

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but again, too much for this course. So,

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
most of what you need is there. You will run across other multi player

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
challenges. My challenge to you really is to

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
make a basic game, use everything you've learned in the course so

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
far. Incorporate some player assets, use Marco's

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
please credit him, say thanks to him on Twitter.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now, the name of his Twitter Handle by the way, you go to

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the video at the start of this section,

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the first video the Intro Assets and Notes, and then, you download

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
his package and what you'll end up with is

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
this thing called Ship and Sea here.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And if you double click Ship and Sea, you'll have a folder

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that opens up, because we need a subfolder anyway, called Thanks to @MarcoVale

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Kaz. Please thank him on Twitter for providing it. And then you can go

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
in there and open the Ship and Sea package, as usual.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now, there's nothing particularly unusual inside that

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
asset pack. Let's just have a quick look at it,

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
it has animations, it has

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
prefabs for the sea and the ship now. I

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
would prefer to use Unity's Standard Assets

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
for the water, just because it's a little prettier and it's reflective, but

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Marco has a very great and high performing solution in there, as well, just by

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
scrolling some textures. So, you've got that, you've got an Animation Control,

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you've got serious animation states. So, you

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
should be able to put all that together, create some simple game play.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Again, you've learned kind of point and click type game play,

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
from Glitch Garden;

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you've learned, I think all the basics you need. See what

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
multiplayer challenges you've face, share the challenges that you face

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
in making your game, in the discussion. And when there's

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
a reasonable amount of challenges built up, and I've got a picture of

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
what you're struggling with, that will tell me what the gap in this course is,

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and of course, I'm committed to the long term development of this course, as you've

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
seen I have to constantly revise it. So, as I start to see people's

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
challenges build up and players make it... uh players! [Laughs] ...students make

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
it through to the end of the course, I will start to consider making

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
further content to help you solve those issues, but I want to

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
be solving the real issues you're having. So, go ahead and make a basic game,

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
share what you can, get stuck when you get stuck, tell us in the

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
discussions, and let's move onwards and upwards! So,

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
see you soon guys!
