
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey welcome back! So, in this video

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
what we're going to be doing is adding a camera

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
as a child of the player, so that we can move around,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
like this and do an over the shoulder view. We are

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
going to find out that we have an issue, when we try doing that

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and that we have a camera conflict problem. We'll find a simple

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
way of solving it, and then, I will show you

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that ultimately we can make this work. We can actually have a

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
camera on two different objects, and they can both move around and

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
even on the Client we can see a different perspective to the

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Host. So, that's what we want and it will scale three ways, as well. We'll also look at

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
building this to a Local Build. So, that's

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
what we're going to be doing in this video, it's going to be fun! By the end of it, you'll really feel like you're making some

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
multiplayer progress! Let's crack on!

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So to make this work, our player is going

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to need a camera, of course, as a child.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, I'm going to get rid of, boldly, the Main Camera in the scene.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If we play now, we're going to get a warning, that there are

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
no full screen cameras. That's OK, we are actually just in a menu system

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
here. By the way, while we're here, I'm also going to temporarily disable

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
my own Start Host Button. We know now that we

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
can reach in and do anything that this does, but I may as well use the test button,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for now, rather than doing two things at once. So, I'm just going to go to Canvas,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Button. I'm just going to call it My Start

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Host Button but then disable it like that,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
so when we play we've got a very simple

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
UI, like that. I may, even while I'm here,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
on the Network Manager Component

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
remember what is creating this. What is creating

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
this UI here. Well, it's the Network Manager

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
HUD OK, and then, you can use the vertical and horizontal,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
offsets there. Now, if you're ever not sure

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
whether a change is going to propagate, once you leave play mode, of course

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
remember you can copy the component. And if we leave Play Mode

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and then re-enter it and find it's forgotten what we've

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
done, then we can paste component

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
values, OK. And that's a way of getting changes from

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Play Mode out, so there you go, I've moved it slightly and it has remembered it. So, a little

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
hint for you. Alright, so where do we

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
want this camera to be? Well, let's put a player in the

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
scene, our prefab, there he is. And let's stick

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
a camera, as

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
a child, to the player.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Alright, so I've childed the camera to the player.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The problem with the way I've just done it, of course, is look at the distance. You've got the player

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
player here and the camera up there. So, we need to just Reset

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the transform. Now, the camera is right on the player.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We zoom to the player, the camera is right in the player. Now,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't really want that. For now, I want to be able to see the player,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
so I'm just going to move the camera back a little bit so we can see the player's head.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Alright, so let's try that firstly, but

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
of course, the Player Prefab I've just modified. Look at the Player

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Prefab, down here. It's not updated,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
so of course, you click player and apply. Now, it's got a camera

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and we don't need an instantiated player yet.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So now, the game has a cube,

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
which is just representing an enemy or something,

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and it has no player, which is normal. We launch the Host, nothing happens. We make the

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Client. Ah hah! Now, it instantiates a player, with a camera

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
childed to it, and I can actually move

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
this player around and that cube just provides some sort of reference in our scene.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Alright, so there's our player, and let's look at that in

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Scene View. There's our player, with the camera

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
attached to it. If we move the camera, the player goes with it. Cool!

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Alright, now let's see what happens if

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
we propagate this change over to the Client, and see whether all is

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
hunky dory. I bet you can guess that all is not quite

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
as we'd hope it would be. Our

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
challenge is before us! So, let me just save over

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
here. Skipitty beepy dee! Let it sync

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to the Client copy. It's like distributing version

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
53 of our multiplayer game. Reload!

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
the smoking gun will be that there is a camera charted

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to the player over here. Cool! Now, let's just go!

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Launch a Host, make the Client, go over here!

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Launch a Client, make it ready!

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Client Ready! Cool! OK, so firstly let's look on the Client Machine. What happens

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
when I move around? Well, it's OK!

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's fine! I am the Client, I can see the other

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
player, the Host Player there, sitting under the cube. OK now, let's go

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
back to the Host. Now, let's try moving. Oh,

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
what's going on there! Well, if you're not sure, click

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
on the player, and look at it's transform up at the top right

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
here, in the Inspector. And you can see that what's happening, when you're

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
clicked clicked into the Game View, of course, is that I am moving

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the correct player, because of

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
course the keyboard commands are being sent to all the player objects, but the Player

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Script, if you remember is doing that cleaver thing where

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it says, if it's not a Local Player then get out of here.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So, that's all working, but the problem is there are two cameras in the scene.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In fact, also because there are two cameras, if you look at this warning down at the bottom

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
here, there are also two audio listeners in the scene.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What's happening, if we look in the Scene View, is that if I

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
move say the Client here, it's

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
moving with its camera, but the camera that is being

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
rendered to the Game View is the camera of this other player,

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
of the Client player. So basically, we don't want two

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
cameras in the scene. What we need to do, and what you're challenge is going to be is to

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
make sure we only ever have one Client in the scene, regardless

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
of how many players we have. So, I want you to

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
disable all but the player's camera. I suggest you do something

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
inside Player.cs. I suggest you use OnStart

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
LocalPlayer() method. Care with it's signature,

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
it's an override again, and have a go, see if you can make this work!

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Remember that you can enable and disable things in the Editor,

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
by default on the prefab, and have a go, this is quite a simple

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
solution to this. And I'll see you on the other side, once you've had a

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
good go!

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That was me clinking my pen against my tea! So I'm back!

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's see if we can make this work! So, remember

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
what we're trying to achieve here, we are trying to get only one

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
camera. So, one simple way is to go to the player and

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
into its camera, and you could consider disabling the Camera

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Component, Camera Object, altogether. The problem with that

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is you then can't find it, because it doesn't exist. So, I'm

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
going to disable the Camera Component of the Camera Object,

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
just by disabling it in the Editor.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah. Then, in the Player script, let's

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
intercept a new message. There's actually a message

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
called OnStartLocal

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Player. Now, if I just go to the docs for that, Command and Control

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and apostrophe and then, bring the new doc window in,

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
let's see if it's going to come and tell us.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There you go! NetworkBehavior, which is what we are,

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
remember that our player is a NetworkBehavior.On

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
StartLocalPlayer, and it's called when the LocalPlayer Object has

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
been setup. But it is a public

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
void signature type, but also

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
we're overwriting the inherited OnStartLocalPlayer,

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
because we've already inherited an OnStartLocalPlayer method from

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
player. So, we want to go public,

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
because we need to match the accessibility, void because...

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Sorry, public override void I believe.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let me see what I've wrote before. Yes of course, that way around, so

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
public override void

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
OnStartLocalPlayer(). Alright, and then we are matching

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the accessibility, we are matching the return type, but we're

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
overriding. Now the question is, what do we do?

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, we can GetComponent in children,

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
of type Camera. Now, let's see

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
what we're doing there, before we go any further. Get

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Component of children in type Camera. We're on the Player,

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
we're looking into the Player's children camera, and we're finding

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
this guy here. This is the component

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
of type Camera on

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the child. And then, what we want to simply do

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
is enabled = true;

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So by default, any player that is created will come with

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
a disableed camera, and then that script should enable it, only for the

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Local Player. Let's check that it works. Actually, let me just save, so

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
DropBox can be syncing. OK, so we play,

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we launch a Host, and we create a Client. Let's have a look at the one player

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
that's in here. It has a camera and it is enabled,

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and it's enabled because this script that we just wrote

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
has enabled it. Let's see if

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
that's true! Let's have a look on the Host over here,

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
on Client rather, on the other machine. Let me let DropBox

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
sync, come back

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
in, let it reload, check

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
our Player script, so you can click on the Player script

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and just look here. Yep, that code has come through!

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's play, launch a Client, and go Client Ready.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Now, from the Client's perspective, let's have a look at these two players. We have this

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
player, which is the Host, and it's camera is

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
disabled, because on the prefab it's disabled. And this

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Player, which is us, it's camera is enabled because our script

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
enabled it. Wicked! So does it work? That's the

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
question. Well, let's move around and have a look. So I as the

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Client here, on the machine that I have on the network,

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
have stood back from the Host Player, and the

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Host Player is sitting under the cube. Now, let's go to the Host,

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
go back into Unity,

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and let's use my local keyboard to move around. Ah hah! Now,

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you see I have the correct perspective. I am now the Host standing back

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
from the Client, who was looking at me under the cube. [Laughs] You get the idea!

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And then, if I reach over to the other keybaord that's it,

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we have First Person Perspective,

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
or of course, for this game it's going to be eventually a third person. We

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
actually have a Third Person Perspective. What's the difference? Well of course, it just depends how

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
far away you are. Is this first or third, well this is over the shoulder,

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
so it's kind of half way in between but you get the

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
idea. So that's it! That's pretty cool! Right now, I want

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
to just give you a couple of warning signs, before we carry on.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That is, you may in your exploration have found this little guy

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
here, which is view, Network View component.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you add that, you'll find it's deprecated. It'll still be

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
in the docs, it'll still be all over the web, when you do these searches, just don't use it.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's deprecated, deprecated means don't use me, because I'm

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
going out of fashion, a bit like tie-dyed

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
clothing or something. I hope I haven't offended anybody. I think I've worn

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that at some point. So that's that!

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't think there's anything else particularly to tell you about that. I think we've achieved

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
all of our objectives for this video.

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So just to reiterate as well, be careful that you disable

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the Camera Component, not the

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Camera itself. If you disable the Camera itself, let's just see

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
what happens. When you

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
launch your Client, you're going to get an "Object reference not

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
set to an instance of an object." And if we look at that,

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that's on line 24

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
which is here, and that's because it can't

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
find a component in the children of type Camera, because

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the child is completely disabled,

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
so the GetComponent won't reach into it. And that

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is why, on my prefab, I disable not

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
the Camera Object alltogether but the

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
camera itself, the component.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Alright, so that is a way of getting it working! You know what I'd like to do before

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
we just move on finally, is I'd like to run this three

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
ways. So, let's make a Local Build and just convince

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ourselves that this works three ways, and then, I think after that

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
it's going to be a question of identifying our players, because it's getting

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
confusing now, to me at least. So, let's make a Mac

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
OS Build. Ahoy Matey

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Mac, I'm going to replace my exising build.

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm going to Allow network access and make a

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
windowed version of it, at a reasonable resolution. Here it is!

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, this is my Local Build! Alright, so before we get too

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
excited, let's get the Host up and running. So, the Host is my Editor

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
version, in this case. LAN Host, Client Ready,

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
good to go. Now, let's tab over to our

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Local Build. Let's make a Local Client to Local Host.

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You could probably use the IP Address, as well.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Client Ready. OK, so let's move this Client around. This guy

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
is working, so I'm going to stand off and to the right, with my Local

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Build. Now, let's come back. Can I see

227
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the other player? I can. Cool! Now,

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
let's go over to the PC version, the Client

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
version on the network. Launch another Client, get it ready,

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and then, view it from here. Ahh look! Three different

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
people, all of which have their own perspectives

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
on the game, and this is good, because this proves

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that we can scale our solution now and here's the

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
third one, which is my Local Build. Fantastic! So, it's a

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
simple scalable solution to getting them all talking to

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
each other and all the camera's independent. So contratulations on

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
getting this far! I will leave you on the screen, with the

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
code that we have just generated. It was simply this

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
overriding the OnStartLocalPlayer behavior

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
of our player, to enable the camera, whcih we've

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
left disabled by default. Much better than going through and looking for all

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the cameras in the scene or in the game and disabling them all

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
or something. Why not just enable? Opt in is better than opt out,

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we know that from e-mails. [Laughs] OK guys, see you soon!
