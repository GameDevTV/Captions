
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey guys! So, in this video I'm going to give you an overview of

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the development process. I'm going to talk about all the different

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ways that we can do it, and then, we're going to go ahead

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and ask you to decide how you want to take this section.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, we'll build a diagram, looking something like this,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which will show you the options, and then, I will give you a

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
challenge. So, let's take a look at our

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
options for developing an multiplayer game, whether

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
or not you have one or two machines.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm going to draw two scenarios. This is if we only have

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
one PC available, and this is if we have

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
two PC's available. Now, I'm only talking about PC's here

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to speed up the development. Of course, you can be testing to

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the mobiles, as well. So, in one

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
PC, then what do we have as an option? So, here's your PC

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
sitting there, and let's just draw some little

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
triangly bits. There we go! And of course, one thing to remember is

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that this, key see, has a keyboard,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
keys, and a mouse. Let's just draw a little mouse

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
here, with a little cable going off into the PC.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
OK. So, in this PC

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we can of course run the Unity editor.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's one thing we can run. And what can

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we test? What could we test that against? Well,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we could actually test it against a build, that we've spat

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
out, a B for build, and then, you could have a stand alone

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
app, running on your PC, and then, you can have a two way

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
game between the build and Unity.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, I hope that makes sense. What I'm talking about is, you literally

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
have the Unity Editor open, with your project.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, I'm just going to open Ahoy Matey here, which has nothing

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
in it yet, because well we've done nothing.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And in one instance, you'd be playing in here and

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
in the other instance you'd have gone to build, and you'd

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
actually built yourself a stand alone version and that would run in another window.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now, that works but hey it's not very convincing, because

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you don't really know anything that's going over

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
the network, it's just going to something called local host. And secondly,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the major challenge is that the mouse and the keyboard are

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
plugged into the same machine, so

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
any movement you make of one character moves to the other. Indeed,

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
even if you want to go through the menu systems of one

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
of these games, the other will respond, and that creates us a real pain.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So, it's possible to do it that way, if you're really stuck for PC's,

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but why not team up with a mate and go for the second

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
option, which is my two PC's option here. This is the one I'm going

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
to go for. I'm going to put it in green, to signify that it's

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that I prefer. So, there are two different

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
machines; I'm going to be working on a Mac on

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the left hand side. That's where I record the course and that we have

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
PC on my local area network,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
on my LAN like that. OK, so they're connected together.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And then, of course, each one then has its own

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
mouse and let's say track pad, in the case of the Mac,

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
because they're super sophisticated, and in the case of clunky old

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
PC's then we have a horrible only fashioned mouse.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
OK. I'm just being prejudice just for fun.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
OK fantastic! So then, we have

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
a simpler, much simpler, way of doing things, but of course you need a

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
second computer, but it has the benefit that we have separate

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
control mouse and keyboard plugged into

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
each. Now, I'm actually going to use a remote control software, so I stay

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
on the Mac and I remote control the PC. What I'll be

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
doing is swiping across, like this, into a Windows environment.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, this is Windows, remote controlled from

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
my Mac. You'll notice it's a bit fuzzy and

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that's simply because the resolution of the screen over on the

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
PC is 720 p, and it's about as good as I can get

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
it. But it doesn't matter, it'll be actually a very easy way for you to

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
tell that I'm on the PC there and I'm on the Mac here.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
OK, so that's the architecture, that's how we're going to be doing

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
things. You will be able to follow along, if you decide to

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
go to local builds. The only thing that you're going to need to notice,

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that's going to be a little bit different, is that in the case

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
of a local build, when we talk about IP addresses,

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
let me just show you what happens. So, over here with a local

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
build, you address something called Local Host,

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and you use that instead of

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the IP address of the PC or the Mac.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So, when I'm doing things, my Mac for example,

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
will have an IP address of something like 192

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
.168.0.44 maybe.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And the PC may have an address of

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
192.168.0.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
something else, OK. And they will need to be

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
setup inside Unity, so that you know what's

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the Host or the Server and

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
what is the Client. We'll talk about the difference between a Host and a Server and a

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Client, in a moment. But generally,

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the PC will be set up as the client, as the person

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
playing the game, and the Mac will be set up, typically, as

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
a Host. Now, what a host is,

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
is basically, is if this is a box... Let me just give

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you a different color to keep things a little bit separate. The

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
idea with the host is that it's both a Server and a Client, in the

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
same machine. So, if this is a Host here,

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
then it has both a Server

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and a Client in it. So,

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
that means I can play the game on the Mac, and the Host Server runs on the

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mac, and then, the PC is acting purely as a Client.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now, this is how you often play, when you do a multiplayer game with your friends.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You often setup as the Host, and that means you play the game

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
but you also host the game. So, that's the typical environment

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we're going to be working in. And if you are going to

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
be doing things from different machines, instead of using Local Host,

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you're going to be using the appropriate IP address, which would

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
depend on your machine, and I'll show you how to find all that out,

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
just in case you don't know. So, there's a brief overview

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
of how we're going to be doing things. We'll go through the course in the right hand

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
scenario, so that we don't have these Control System issues. If you've got just

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
one machine, then you're going to have to test against a Local

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Build or possibly a Mobile Build.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So, here's another final option for you,

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is you could go against a mobile of some

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
sort, so I'll just represent that like that. You

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
could go over Wifi, which I'll represent like

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that, it's like a little Wifi symbol, to a

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
mobile, that is possible, it's still via the LAN.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
OK. But I'm not going to be showing you all how to do this. I'm

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
going to assume that if you've got this far in the course, and you're pretty serious,

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that you're going to be able to get hold of a second machine or you're going to be able to

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
team up with a friend or even go into the

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
course discussions and ask another student, if they

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
want to team up with you. And you could talk to them over Skype,

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
at the time of your arrangement, and actually arrange to

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
develop this together and to through the section together, possibly. So,

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that is my challenge of you, in this video.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So, I want you to arrange your environment. See if you can

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
access a second machine locally. That's ideal! If not, ask in the

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
discussions for somebody to work with, and include your time zone

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and some times that you could work. If not that, then consider building

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
to mobile, but I won't be showing you in detail how to do that. It just

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
slows the development down a little, and the worse case is, you build to a PC, Mac,

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Linux stand alone, on the same machine, and you just have

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
to deal with the control system differences. Perhaps using W,

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
S, A, D, for one play, and I don't know I, J, K, L,

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
for another. So that's it! Arrange your environment, get in the

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
discussions, and tell us how you're going to be taking this multiplayer

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
section. Ask for other students, if you need to.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture, where we'll crack on and

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
start making things work!
