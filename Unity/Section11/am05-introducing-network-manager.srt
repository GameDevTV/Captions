00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey. welcome back guys!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So. in this video I'm going to introduce you to the concept of a

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
stack of API's in networking. We will

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
have a quick look at Unity's Network Stack. find out where to get

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
started with networking. and by the end we will have a very simple Network

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Manager. in our scene. and an ugly Player prefab

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we will be able to start playing and actually launch a

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
host and have our player spawn. So. that's the objective of this video!

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So. as with a lot of things in life. a good place to

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
start is with a simple Google search. So. here we go!

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I've searched for Unity Networking. Oh. by the way. you can use

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
whatever search engine you choose. I'm not particularly partial to Google.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You could use one to of the other major search engines. [Laughs]

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Anyway. so here you go. "Unity - Manual: Multiplayer

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Networking". So quick overview basically suggests

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that you can do it on multiple platforms. which is one of its strengths.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we then dive into Networking Overview. at this

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
URL up here. UNetOverview.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you'll see "Users making a Multiplayer game"... "should start with NetworkManager

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and the High Level API." Alright. well there's a couple of hints there.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's open those two up. NetworkManager and High Level API.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So. NetworkManager has got a lot of information

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
about it. and it's a component you can add and we'll look at that in a moment.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And then. the High Level API. I just want to

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
show you this diagram. So. I want to explain the concept of a

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
stack. What's happening here is all these different layers. from the physical

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
kind of transport layer. at the very bottom. as to how

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the packets are sent and received through. The network.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
all the way through Connection and Clients and Identities and scenes. right

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
up to NetworkTransform. which allows you to

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
lock the transform of two different itmes in the game and move them together

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and to sync animations over the network. etc.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
There's a whole load of different layers that all talk

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to each other. so that's a stack. a stack of layers. And we'll actually be

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
diving in at various different levels of this stack. We won't be

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
concerning ourselves with this bottom layer here or even really too much

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
with the connection layer. but we will be talking about NetworkIdentity and

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
NetworkManager and a few others. So. there's an

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
overview of how it all stacks together. The question

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is. back in Unity. how do we even start? Well. I want

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
you to have a go at starting. now that I've given you a very strong hint as to

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
where to start. I want you to do the following. Add

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
an empty game object. positioned anywhere.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Add a Network Manager component. Also. add a Network

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Manager HUD component. temporarily. And

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
then take a look around those components and see if you can get the game

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to run. without errors. You will have to do one or two things. just

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
be guided by the errors until you can get the game to just run.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It wouldn't do anything. it would just be able to keep sitting there. but see if you can get it to run without

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
errors. So. pause the video and have a go at doing this early bit

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
yourself now.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So welcome back! I'm going to

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
crack on with exactly that! So. an empty GameObject goes into the

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
scene. I'm going to put it at Y = 100. just to get it

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
well up in the air. out of the way. so that the transform gizmo.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
these little arrows. don't get in my way.

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Fantastic! So now. it actually turns out that if you put a NetworkManager

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
HUD on that it has a dependency of a Network

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Manager. Let's collapse those down. So. I've added the HUD

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and you'll see what that does. in a moment. And that has a dependency of a NetworkManager.

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So. let me just show you what the HUD does. so you're not wondering. If we

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
play. I think it's actually using the old UI

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
or GUI methods to draw these pretty ugly

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
buttons. and we're not going to use these for long. because

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I want you to know how to make these method calls yourself.

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
because if you don't then well you're stuck with these ugly buttons. which we don't want.

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So. that's what the HUD does if we

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
disable the HUD. Then. when you play. you just get nothing whatsoever

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
it's just as if nothing exists.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Alright! So. if you play the game. then

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
it works fine and you may not have had any errors. Now.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
if you'd have gone and said. I want to be a LAN Host.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
which means that you are both being a player and a

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Server. then you will bet these errors. The Player prefab is

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
empty. on the NetworkManager. Please setup a Player Prefab

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Object. OK cool. so let's do that! Firstly. I'm going to

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
name

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Network Manager to Network

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Manager. and then. I'm going to create another empty object.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'm going to call it Player.

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and it really has to have

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
nothing on it at the moment. it just needs to be a

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
prefab. So. let's move the Player just

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
a little bit. say in Z. just so it's in a different position.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And I think just for

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
simplicity I will add. from scratch. a

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Cylinder. so I need a Mesh Filter.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and then. I'm going to make a Cylinder Mesh on it. This is

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
a slightly strange way to build up a Cylinder. I'm just showing you that you can do it from

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
scratch like this. And a Mesh Renderer.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
OK. and then. we've got a basic Player there. He's

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
orange. he's ugly. that's fine! So. the point

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that we needed is we needed a Player prefab. so of course. you

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
prefab that Player and now we have a Player prefab. So

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
finally. let's go look at the NetworkManager. briefly! Don't

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
destroy on load. that means it'll persist through to another scene. It's running

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
in the background. That's what we want! Well. I won't go through the details of the

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
rest of these. for the moment. Bear in mind. that we are going to need to change

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Network Address later. when we come to talk to another machine. You'll leave it as Local

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Host. if you're running against a build. and you will change it

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to the IP Address of the other machine. if you're doing it that way.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So. what we do need though is a Player prefab. to stop that error

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
message. So now. when you try and drag the Player

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
prefab. what do we get? We get "playerPrefab must have

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
a Networkidentity." So. this is where we bring in the

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
concept of Network Identity. So. the Network Manager

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
must have a Player to spawn. when the game starts. right.

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and all objects that we're going to use

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in the multiplayer game. that are going to communicate over the network. must have a Network

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Identity. And if we add

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that component. we won't worry about what

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the options are. for the moment. but that gives this thing an ID.

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
that the Networking System can use. alright. Now of course.

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I've added it to the instance. I haven't applied it back to the prefab. So

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
now. I have applied it back to the prefab. and we can check that in the

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Prefab. So. what we're doing is just adding a

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
simple object. that must have at least a Network Identity

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
on it. to the Player prefab.

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Ah hah! And this is an old error. let's try running!

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Here we go but we don't know that it's working yet. because

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
we haven't tried to create a Server or a Host. So. I'm going to make a Host.

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
There you go! Now. what's happened here

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
is it's actually made a new Player at

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
the central position. So. we have our Player prefab. that we left in the scene. and

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
a new one right over the cube

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
there. So. because the Player is going to be spawned

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
for us. when we start playing. we don't actually need

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the Player instance to be in

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the scene. from the beginning. So. we can remove that now. so

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
all we've got is a scene that has a cube in it. just so that it's got something

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
in it. and NetworkManager.

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
which is going to sit there and persist and provide us with some

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Heads Up Display HUD. to control it.

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And then. a Player prefab is linked into

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that. so that when we play the game. then

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
you launch a Host. the Player gets spawned.

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Also. if you play the game and launch as a

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Server. the Player does not get spawned. because servers don't

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
have any players in them right. they are just pure Servers.

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And if we launch as a Client.

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
then what's going to happen? Nothing! So. we'll

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
see later. why when you try and launch as a Client.

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
we don't get a Player appearing. OK. we're only

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
going to get a Player appearing when there's a Host. because

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
in simple terms. you can't have the Player or the Client without

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
a server. So. a Host is a Server plus a

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Client. these two together. So. that's why the only thing

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that currently works is clicking Host. Server comes up.

149
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the Player gets spawned. and we're good to go.

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Alright. so that's fantastic! In the next video I'm going to show you how

151
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to make the API calls that these

152
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
buttons make. yourself OK. so that we don't rely on this

153
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
hidden functionality. Let's start breaking down how this stuff works!
