1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Multiple players with local authority! So, in this video

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we'll be adding a Network Transform to our player

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and making sure that this type of movement works. So, this is going

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to be the end result, is that I can

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
move this character from two places. So, in Game View,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for example, I have my hand on the keyboard of the Client, and the right

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
hand character is moving and on the Host the left hand. So, we

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
can actually kind of have a little fight, that looks more like a multiplayer game.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
OK. [Laughs] So, that's what we're going to do in this video.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, just before we solve this problem, let's see what the

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
problem really is. So, I'm going to play the game, launch a

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Host, and get my Local Client ready, which I can merely

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
move around the screen, I'll move it to the left. Now, let's hop

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
over to the Client Machine, launch a Client

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
instance and get its Client ready, and move it to

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the right. OK, so

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
what issue are we having. Well, if

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I go back to the Host, and move my thing

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
even further to the left, you see the Client

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
hasn't noticed that that's happened.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We're missing a Network Transform, of course and the same the other way around.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If on the Client I move, the

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Host doesn't see the move. OK, so it's simply

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a question of using Network Transform. There is a subtlety to it

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but for now I want you to just use the Network Transform

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that we've talked about before, to get

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the player movement syncing. Use the NetworkTransform component,

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
read about Local Player Authority,

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then, as a bonus, discover the effect of setting this setting.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You'll actually find that just the Network Transform will fix the problem,

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but Local Player Authority still does something.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So, see if you can have a play around in Scene View, and

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
see if you can work out what Local Player Authority

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
does. And ideally post the result of what you find

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
in the discussions, before you finish the challenge, and then, you've really kind

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
kind of finished it and committed an answer. Even if it's wrong it doesn't

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
matter, the idea is that you've explored. So, go ahead, pause the video,

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and see if you can get this Local Player Authority working!

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Well, welcome back!

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So, let's have a look! What do we need to do to make it work?

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Well, it's simply go to the Player Prefab and add ourselves

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a new component, which is the Network Transform Component, that we saw

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
before. I'm actually going to move this up, because I just want it to

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
be right next to identity. I want to look down this and go, what is this thing? It's

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a transform, a cylinder, it's got a renderer. I don't really care about the

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
rendering, for the moment, but I do care that it's got a network identity,

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
with Local Player Authority or without. We'll see

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the difference in a moment, and then, a Network Transform is the key. Let's just

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
make sure that works. So again, we slightly

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
laboriously have to go to our Client, let it sync,

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
come back in here, just check that this

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Player Prefab has now received

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
its Transform Component, which it hasn't yet which means the

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
dropbox hasn't quite finished syncing. It's a little clunky doing it this way, but I've found it's

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the fastest way to get the version of the game across. Now, a common

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
mistake, if it hasn't gone across to see you haven't saved over here. I

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
have saved but it's worth checking. And then, in

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
a moment, we should find that we get a Network Transform.

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Ah slightly frustrating. Again, in a more

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
serious environment, you would probably be using version control here,

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but we're trying to iterate so fast, that we want to make sure

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
we can as quickly as possible get this change propagated. So, let's just try

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
once more. So, the problem

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I'm having here is just distributing my game, if you like. Here you

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
go, the Network Transform has arrived on the Client! So, let's play!

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Get the Host going, get the Client ready on the

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Host, over to the Pure Client Machine.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Launch Client, Client ready! OK, so I moved to

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the right, on the PC on the Client, and back here

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm going to move to the left. And you can see it's working.

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In fact, look from here I can see the other player. I've got my hand on

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the keyboard of the other machine. Awesome! And again I can get another

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Client Machine, and I can

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
see myself moving on here. So, it's all working. That's fantastic!

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The question is, what does this Local Player Authority checkbox actually

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
do for us. So, stop the game, and you need to actually

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
turn off the Local Player Authority, before you start. It seems to

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
remember once it's playing, so you can't do this in Play Mode.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So, I'm going to just let this change propagate,

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
so the player now no longer has a Local Player Authority

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
on it. Let's go and make sure that's gone over to the

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Client Machine, it probably hasn't.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It seems to be refreshing. There you go perfect!

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Now, let's run it with the Local Player Authority setting turned

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
off. So, get the Host and its Client ready, Make sure we can move around, we can.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Put it to the left again. Over to the Client,

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
enable the Client, get it's Client ready, reach over to the other

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
keyboard, and move over to the right. OK, so it looks

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
like, back on the Host, that these transform

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
changes aren't actually being sent, now.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So, if from the Client I start moving now,

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
without Local Player Authority on, then

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
we do not have a movement being received

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
back on the host. So, it does actually break

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
things, because the Client Network Transform

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is not being told to send the Transform change

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
up, it's all coming from the Host. In fact, if we're on the Host

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and we select this right hand guy and move him out and then look

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
at the Client, it will move. Let's test that by say moving it off the ground.

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
There it goes! So, all the transform changes

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
are coming from

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
this side, from the Server side,

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
on the Host and being sent across to the

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Client, which is obviously backward. It's the wrong way.

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So, we need to leave the

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Local Player Authority turned on.

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And it has another consequence, the Local Player Authority, which

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
is, let me just show you this. So, I'm going to just slightly, naughtily

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
set it on the client, because the sync is a single check

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
box. Generally, you want to make all your changes here and let them sync over DropBox, but when

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
it's a boolean on/off like that, and it's the only thing you're changing

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
then I think you can probably get away with it. Don't tell anybody.

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So, we're back on now, with Local Player

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Authority on, and let's just confirm it works.

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Here we are on the Client, so let's

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
move and then let's look at the Client, from the Host and that works

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and vise versa. The host is moving left and right, and if I move

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
left, if I look on the Host and the Client... The Host

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the Client, you get the idea! It's working! The point is that with this

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Local Player Authority on, watch what happens if I go into

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Scene View, on the Host and say move the right hand

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
player, the Client Player up into the air. It doesn't move,

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
hasn't moved, and the moment that I move

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
on the Client Machine, it'll snap back to that place.

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You see that again! I move it up because we have

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Local Player Authority on, on this

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
player, the bottom player, which is the player from the Host,

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and this is not the Local Player, it knows

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it's not the Local Player. Remember our script even accesses

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
if is not local player leave; the very

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
thing that's filtering the input, the very reason why in game,

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
if I go left and right arrows, only the left hand one moves.

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It's because the system knows this is not the Local Player, which

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
means that the Network

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Transform and Network Identity Components, who talk to each other,

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
know that this is not the Local Player. So,

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
we have no authority over this player. It looks like we're

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
moving it in Scene View, which of course you couldn't do at run time, but

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
over on the Client it's not moving, and the moment I touch a key

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
on the Client, boom, it snaps to the

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
new position. So, it is exactly what it says! The Local Player,

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
i.e. on the Client Machine, has authority over

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the transform of this Game Object.

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So, that's the point! What we need to next, of course, is get

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
cameras working, which of course comes with it's own challenge in multi-

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
player. But that's fine, we're here to solve the challenges, and I'll see you in

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.833
the next video!
