
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome back!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this video, we're going to be looking at how to

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
add text to our scene. So, this is something we've seen,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you might have seen before, but in our video we're going to

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
be looking at how to add the text elements. We're going

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to be looking a little bit more in depth as to how we can scale and

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
position the text and what the tools are to do so. And we're

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
going to be using the UI mode, the

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
specific UI mode in Unity, to

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
postion our elements and to see the diference between a normal

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Move Mode and the UI Mode. So, let's get

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
started. So, right now I've got a bunch of

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
scenes, in my Unity game. I'm going to start with

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the Start Scene, and you're gonig to see as soon as I double click it

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the name of my scene appears at the top of my

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
window, on the Title Bar. So, now I'm in the Start Scene,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to add some text. And how do

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I add some text? Well, you've probably done it before, in a previous section,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but let's go over it again. You go to Game Object,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
UI, and Text, and

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that will bring in quite a few things to your game. And you can

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
see it straight away. In your Hierarchy, you'll see there

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is a Canvas, a Text Element that is

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
inside the Canvas, and an Event System. So, it'll bring you

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
three things, so there are three different things brought

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in for adding some text. So,

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
now let's go over them, one by one, and take

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
a look at what they mean. So firstly, we take a look at the Canvas.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I just double click my Canvas, and we can see it appear on

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
screen and this is my Canvas right here. Now,

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you'll notice that there's a quite big difference between the Canvas

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and the Main Camera. If I click on the Main Camera and

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we look at the Inspector, on the right hand side, we can see it has

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
a Transform Component, which has a Position, a

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Rotation, and a Scale, pretty standard stuff. And then, some camera specific

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
things. But if I

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
click on my Canvas, you will see that the Canvas has

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
some Canvas specific things like the Renderer and the

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Scaler, etc., but it also has a different type of

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Transform. It has what's called a Rect Transform.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The best part of this UI System is that

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
the UI System has a different type of Transform,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that allows us much more control over the positioning of our

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
elements, in a UI System, in a menu,

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
or in a physical UI in the world space.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, that's the first thing we need to notice. The second thing we to

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
notice is that the Canvas has what's called a Render Mode.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, the Render Mode is about how

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the Canvas is Rendered on the scene.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And right now, we've got it at Screen Space-Overlay, so

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
if you look at the Inspector, you've got the Canvas component,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it has a Screen Space - Render Mode Property

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
or attribute, and it will have Screen Space - Overlay,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Screen Space Camera, and World Space. Right now, we're not going to

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
worry too much about what they mean. We can keep it in Screen Space Overlay,

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and that basically, Screen Space Overlay, means the

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Canvas will be rendered on top of everything just before the

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
screen is shown to the user, so when

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the engine renders the scene,

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
it'll start rendering all the objects within the scene, etc., etc.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then, in the very final step, it'll render the Canvas,

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
on top of that, as an overlay on the

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
screen and not on the scene and then that will be shown to the

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
user. So, we don't worry too much about that for now, but just remember

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that's where you find the Render Mode

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
for a Canvas, it's in the Inspector. And

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
finally, once we've got the Canvas

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you'll have inside of it a Text Element. So, that's

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the Text Element, the element that actually

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
has the text in it. Now, you can move it around

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
with your mouse, as you would a normal object,

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and you see it has the normal handles, with the

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
two arrows to show its position and some text in there.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's zoom in a little bit to show you the text. So, if we zoom

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
in here, we can see that there's a new text. It's all black, it's quite

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
small. Now, you'll notice here that the

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Rect Transform has now become active, and this is what's quite Important

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
about UI Elements, is their Rect Transform.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now, you've got Standard Position, Width, and Height, etc.,

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but it also has things like the Anchor and the Pivot,

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
which are different concepts kept

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
for UI Elements. And there's quite a few options,

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
so if you click this little target area here,

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
of the Rect Transform, you can see quite a few different options

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
about where it'll be anchored in

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the scene. And really, to see what that means

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
we need to enter UI Mode, and UI Mode

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
is entered by selecting the 5th button,

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
on the top left hand corner of the Unity Editor,

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
or pressing the T Key. So, if I press the

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
T Key or if I click this button I will now enter a different

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
mode, that let's me view what my Canvas is doing.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, now we've got this element, and you'll see that

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
it's appearance has actually changed, quite a bit, it now

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
has a full blue

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
dots on the outside, and a blue dot

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
in the middle, and you'll see the blue dot in the middle is the Pivot.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's where you're going to be scaling from.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then, it has those four blue dots, so you can

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
change its size and width, etc. You'll also notice

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that if you drag it around, it'll snap

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
to the center line of your containing

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Canvas. Alright, so if I move it around, it'll snap to the

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
center line of the containing Canvas with a blue line,

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
when it is centered. So, that's the Pivot.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And then, the second thing that you'll see in the middle, when I've got my

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
element select, is the Anchor. That's how

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the element is anchored, and right now, it's anchored to the center

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
of my screen. Now, what that means is if we re-scale

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
the Canvas outside, this element will remain

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
in its position, relative

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to the center of the screen. Now, there are other options

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
for example, I could have it at the bottom, and you could see how that is.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
By clicking on the Anchor Preset, I've anchored it to the bottom, so

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
it'll remain at this distance, from the bottom, or I

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
could have it to the side but I'm going to keep it in the center.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You also have the option of stretching it,

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
so by clicking the Stretch Option, on the

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Anchor Selection Screen, what this actually means

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
is if my Canvas stretches out,

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
in the Horizontal direction, then so

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
will my text. My text will remain in that proportion, compared

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to the Canvas, that it will actually scale with the

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Canvas. Whereas, if it's anchored in the middle, without stretching,

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
it'll remain with the same dimensions, it'll simply

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
keep it's position relative to the center.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Alright, that's a lot of stuff, and there's also quite a few

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
other options. You can use Shift to select the Pivot, change the

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Pivot as you move it, or to set the position.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, there's quite a lot of things you can do. You can see that

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
when I select different keys, the actual appearance

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
has changed quite a lot, and you can do quite a lot of things.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What I would advise you to do is, spend some time playing

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
around with this, playing around with all of the pre-sets and all the settings,

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
to get familiar with what they mean and how they

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
behave and what happens when you rescale the Canvas, when you change

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
its appearance, with the different

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
settings. So cool! Now, we've gone over this! It's time for you

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to play around with it a little bit, but first let's

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
get this new text looking a little bit better.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So right now, I want it to be in the middle. I do

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
want it to be anchored to the center, and I'm going to

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
change the text to be a welcome message, so

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
we're going to call it "Welcome to

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Number Wizard". Let's put

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
some capitals. [Typing Sound]

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And I'm going to

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
call my player, "Puny Human",

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because I like that. Cool! So,

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
"Welcome to Number Wizard, Puny Human!". Now, we can't really see it

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
here, it's not really big enough. So, what am I going to do? I'm going

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to change the Width, the Height, sorry the Font

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Size, and I can do that by clicking and dragging and you can see it

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
going up and down. I'm aslo going to change the color. I think that

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
color isn't great. I'm just going to pick a white,

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
so that it's very bold and bright. You can choose whatever color you want.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I can change the size of my text,

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to make it fit on the screen properly. Here we go!

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And center it and there

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
we go. Maybe stretch it a little bit more. There

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
we go. "Welcome to Number Wizard, Puny Human!"

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Note that I can add a new line, if

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I want to, in my text,

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
so... Oops, Control Z. If I

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
want to add a new line, I can.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So, let's do that now, here we go. "Welcome to

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Number Wizard, Puny Human!" That sounds great,

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and that will do for my title.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So cool! That is how you add text and how

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
you scale it and move it around in Unity.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, it is your turn! I want

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you to, in the same manner as we did just now,

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
add a subtitle, prompting the user to make a choice

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
of number, and that's up to

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you. So, just pause the video now and add your subtitle.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
OK

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
then! How, did it go? This is what I'm going to do,

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
the very same thing, and to add my subtitle

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm going to select the Canvas first, because I want to add it to my

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Canvas. I'm going to go Game Object, UI,

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Text, and you'll notice that the second Text component

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
only adds the text, because we already have a Canvas we're adding to,

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and an Event System and you'll only need one of each.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We'll go over the Event System in just a little bit, and I'm going to center this text.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Also, make

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
it, maybe a little orange,

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
maybe something like that. That looks more like it.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
There we go, something like

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
orange. Maybe not

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
that much. Here we go and that's great!

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, now I've got some new text. I'm going to increase the font size.

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That looks fine.

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Stretch it out. That's a bit too big, I don't want it bigger than

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
my title, so how about

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that. That looks fine! And my prompt is

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
going to be "Choose a number

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
[Typing Sound]

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
[Laughs] Not a nummer but a number.

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
...between

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
1 and 1,000

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
if you dare".

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Here we go! Now, I'm

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
going to change that, and notice that if

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I want to re-scale here, you'll see that I'm re-scaling

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and my Pivot point is moving, because I'm re-scaling

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
not relative to my Pivot Point, but just re-scaling

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
relative to the opposite corner. Now, if I press

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
the Alt Key, I will be re-scaling

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
relative to my Pivot Point, so that's quite a nice trick.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If I've got my Alt Key

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
pressed, you'll see that the re-scaling, that will be here is quite different.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So, that looks good.

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Let's center the text. Here we

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
go! And that is how we finish

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
our introduction to adding text to Unity.

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Now, we have a front screen, let's play it and see what it looks like.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Here we go! Pretty much what we

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
expected. I'm going to change the background color of my Main

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Camera. I think I would much prefer to have a black background.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So, let's set it to black.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Play it again,

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and we get what we expect. Great!

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Now also, what we'll notice... Let's pause the

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
game again. What we'll notice is the third and final

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
thing that's been added, when we created our first Text Element, and that's

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
the Event System. Now, the Event System is compulsary.

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You have to have an Event System for

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
UI events to work, so if your UI isn't working,

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
double check you've got an Event System in your scene, and make sure

230
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
you've not renamed it to something else. So, that's the Event System

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and it's useful, because it's basically handling all the events

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that will be thrown by the UI and triggering

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the right handlers, depending on the

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
actions that occure. So for example, let's say you're on a tablet,

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the Event System will appropriately detect and

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
pass through multi-touch events

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
so that you can know what to do in your game.

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So, that's why we've got the Event System, and really the complexity of the Event System

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
is something you don't really have to deal with but

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
if you want to get a little bit more stuff done with it,

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and for example look at Touch

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Input or change different types of input, for example

243
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
using the controller; that's when you'll start worrying about

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
the Event System but not for now. For now, we'll just leave it as it is

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and know that it's compulsary for events to work

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
in our game. So, now you'll

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
notice, in a lot of cercumstances,

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
if you're looking online for tutorials about UI, you'll

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
find this on Unity. This Unity

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
GUI called OnGUI () function, that you have to use,

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and that's the old legacy

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
UI Framework. So, that's the Legacy User Interface Framework,

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
where you have to define everything we just had to do in the Editor,

254
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
but instead of doing it by hand in the Editor,

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
with all the handles that make it really easy, you have to do

256
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
everything in code and you have to draw every

257
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
element of your UI

258
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
from your code. So, that's the old way of creating

259
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
GUIs. And you don't really want to use this way anymore,

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
so just a heads up, a

261
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
word of warning, if you find some tutorials online that

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
use that kind of OnGUI method or OnGUI

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
function or the GUI.Button or GUI.Box or rectangle

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
functions, then you don't want

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
to use those, you want to use the new UI System.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So, that's pretty much it, for now. We're pretty much

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
done with our video. I hope it's

268
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
been useful and interesting, and I hope you've had a chance to play around

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
with the different positioning and scaling modes,

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
for UI Elements. I will see you

271
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
very shotly, in the next video! Bye for now!
