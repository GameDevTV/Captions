Hello. and

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
welcome back! In this video. we're going to be looking at finishing Number

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Wizard. In particular. we're goingt to be using Random.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Range. to make sure that our guests feel a lot

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
more natural. when we play the game. So. let's get

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
started. So. I'm here in the game

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we have a game that starts. pretty simply. Let's

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
play through it to see what it looks like. I press

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Start. I pick a number. if it's my number.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
etc.. etc. The problem I've got right now. with this

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
game is that the guesses just don't look

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
natural. Every time we start a new game.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it's always the same guess. and the first couple

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
look very artificial. You know you've got to divide by 2.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so the numbers are pretty obvious

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
before you even start. really. So. you want to change that.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We want to change that. so that the numbers are not so obvious.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
when you start the game. So. how are we going to do that? Well. let's take a

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
look at the Number Wizard code.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to see what we can do about that. So. in

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the Number Wizard code. we've got a StartGame ().

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and right now. the algorithm for the first guess

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is. really take the max and min and

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
divide by 2. And what we want to do is change

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
from max + min over 2. to a different

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
guess. to a random guess within the

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
range. between max and min. And to do that. we're going to use

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the Random.Range function.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And in fact. I'm not going to use the Random.Range function.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
you are. You're going to have to go and look at the Random.Range function.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the Unity API documentation. and I

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
want you to use it to pick a number

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
randomly between the minimum and the maximum

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
of our guess. our possible guesses.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So. pause the video now and give it a shot!

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Using the API documentation. for Random

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
.Range. to see whether you can guess a random number instead of

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
picking the halfway point. I'll see you soon!

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[Temporary Silence]

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So. how did it go? Let's

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
take a look at how we would do that. Here we are in

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
our next guess function. and we are a

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
number here. in the halfway point. between

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
max and min. And I want to stop that happening. I want instead

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to take a number. which is Random.

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Range. and that's not going to be... It is going to

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
be Random.Range. and we're going to pick a number between the

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
minimum. which is going to be min

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and the maximum. which is going to be max.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
However. Random.Range.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
if you look at the documentation carefully. it'll say it picks

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
between minimum inclusive and maximum exclusive.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
when it picks it's first number. Now. we want to pick a

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
random number. that could include the maximum. so we're going to have to

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
do max + 1. Just like

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
we did here. when we were doing the algorithm manually.

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but now. we're actually doing it in Random.Range. The

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Random.Range needs to have a number

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
or the maximum to be one more than the one we

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
potentially want. so we're adding 1 to max.

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and we no longer need to do it here. We no longer

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
need to do it here. So. we've got this going now. and

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
if we play the game now and jump in let's

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
get started. let's jump into our game.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
press play. and

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
press Start. And now. it still starts at 500.

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Now. the guesses are random. once I do that.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
That's a much better guess. but it still starts at 500.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so what I want to do is. start my first guess

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
as soon as I launch. So. instead of

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
waiting and having a predefined guess. instead of using

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
guess = 500. what I want to do is

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to go and run my next guess here.

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
That way. my first guess will be the first

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
thing I do. I'll guess first. change the number to

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
a random one. between 1 and a 1.000. and this is going to

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
be 1.001. because we want the player to be able to pick

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
1.000 because we already do

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the max + 1 here. So. that's going to be between 1 and 1.000

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and I run my next guess. So. I'm going to save that.

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
jump back into my game. and see what it looks like.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So. if I press Play now. press Start you'll

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
see there's already a number picked. and that's 888.

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So. let's say I pick 324. So. I

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
324. not bad! That was pretty

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
quick. for the computer. It randomly gets 324 pretty quickly.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So now. we have a game that does not

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
look artificial anymore. We're not picking 500 every time

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
or 750. they look like pretty round

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
artificial numbers. Now. we're picking randomly. it

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
still works as we would expect it to.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So. that is great! We have now a game that looks

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
pretty normal. and we've also managed to. in one

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
shot. not only use Random.Range. but also

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
change the computer's guess at the start of the game. so that we show

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the right value. when we start. So. we've got an

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
existing guess. So. here we are and that's it for

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
this lecture. it was pretty short and pretty simple. but now you've got

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Random.Range. That's a pretty useful tool. to do lots of things.

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
including randomly selecting between

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
items in an array. For example. let's say you want to randomly spawn

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
an enemy in future games. you can use Random.Range

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to pick a random index into that array and spawn that

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
enemy and lots of other things. So. that

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is it. for this lecture. Congratulations on

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
finishing Number Wizard UI! You now have a Number

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Wizard game. that reflects the very first game you created in

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the Console. but now is visual and

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
you can share it with your friend on Game Bucket

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
or otherwise. So. that's it for now! I'll see you in another

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
lecture! Bye!
