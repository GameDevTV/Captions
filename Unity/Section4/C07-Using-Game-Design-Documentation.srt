00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello. and welcome back!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this video. we're going to be talking about how to use a Game Design

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Document and what a Game Design Document is.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So. let's take a look at what a Game Design Document is.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's a tool that we use to communicate between members of our team. so it's

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a communication aid. It's for example. when you're going to

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
be talking to a team member. you're going to be pulling out

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a napkin and a big felt tip pen and drawing a

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
diagram on that napkin. to just show him something you're talking about.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well. that diagram probably ought to go in the Game

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Design Document. Anything that's used to illustrate the point to

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
help your communication. say refer back to that diagram.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it's this element in that diagram. that probably belongs in your

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
GDD. So. that's every member of your team. right.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So. that could be the artists. that could be the developers. and the designers.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and everybody else who communicates. Let's say your marketing strategies.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
etc.. etc. And the idea is. you

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are collecting this data. so you can talk about common

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
reference points. Every game. every major game. every

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
game that's significantly large.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
will have its own glossary. It will have

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
its own set of words. that have meanings specific to

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
this project. and that really ought to be in the

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
GDD. for example. It's also a place to record your decisions

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
you're going to be making. about what's in and what's out of

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
your game. And what's out is actually really important. it's really

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
easy to define what's in and then. have the scope

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
creep up on you. while you're developing. It's really useful.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
at the beginning. when you decide we're not going to be doing this.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to write it down and set it in stone. so that nobody gets tempted afterwards.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to add a feature that doesn't really add value

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to your game. or maybe you want to keep something for

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
another game or for a downloadable content pack. whatever

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
you want to do. That's why you record your decisions

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
in the GDD. And that's both before

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you actually start development and also during your development.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The GDD is actually a living

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
document. it's something that's going to be changed and modified

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
according to what happens. according to the new things you learn. so

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
let's say you want to create a new diagram

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to explain the new system you've built.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
of the code so that the designer can use it. Well. that's

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
halfway through development. and that also goes in your GDD.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And it's not a plan. it's not something you use to plan your work. it's something you use

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to communicate and to record your decisions. and it's really useful

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
even if you're on your own and your not talking to someone else. because

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
a lot of the time. you're communicating to your future self.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You want to be able to make a decision

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
or think of a system and say. hey future self. me

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in six months time is actually another person. and that's really useful

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to have a place to record these kind of things. you're thinking.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
final decisions. so that you can use it in the future.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So. how are we going to be using a GDD. in this game?

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Well. let's take a look at our GDD

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
for Number Wizard UI.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So. we've got it kept. it's very simple right. it's a very very

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
simple GDD. We've got it kept in Google Docs and

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that's because we want to be able to share it and

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
work on it separately. and when we're working remotely

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
when we're making games for this course. And the idea

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is we've got this simple flow diagram. which shows how the scenes

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
are hanged together and how they communicate and how

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the player goes through scenes. as well as some

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
sample mock-up scenes. which we have underneath.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And those are pretty simple. you can see it's only two pages. there's

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
three pages rather. but there's very little in there and that's

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
because Number Wizard UI is a really simple game. so it doesn't need all that

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
much stuff. We could add a little bit about the rules of Number Wizard.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but really. the rules for Number Wizard are actually encoded already.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the previous GDD we made for

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Number Wizard Console. So. we don't really need to worry too

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
much about that. because those are pretty well defined. What we do want to

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
worry about. however. is this scene diagram. So. this

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Scene Diagram shows all the four scenes of the game

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and they also show how the player moves through them. And that's a

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
really useful diagram to have. if you have many scenes. so you understand what

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
kind of transition you should be expecting. And for

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
example right now. we have a Start Menu to Game transition. when you click

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Start. but we also have a game to Start Menu transition.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and we can see. just by looking at this diagram. that we're not going

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to need this transition. for very long. We're not going to be...

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It's only a temporary transition. to get used to making them.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But really the game ought to exit to a Win Screen

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
or a lose screen. and then. those ought to go to

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Start Menu. start again. So cool! So. what

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
does that mean for us and our game right now? Well. if we take a look

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
at our Unity Editor. we can see that we have

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
four scenes. however. they're not wired together yet. We only have

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
the Start Scene and the Game Scene. and they're not

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
even wired correctly. So. what's the purpose of this video? It's to

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
use the GDD to refer back to the GDD to get

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
those things wired up. in the way the final game will

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
eventually be wired up. So that way. when we get to

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
grab the code from out previous Number Wizard game. we can simply

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
slot it into our Game Scene. and everything else will already be done.

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Without further adieu. let us get started.

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The first thing I want to do is look at the Win Scene

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and create the Win Scene.

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
as we would expect it to. So. I'm going to go into my

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Start Scene alright. and I'm going to copy everything.

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and go into my Win Scene.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
delete the camera I already have. and then.

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
paste all of the things I've already got from

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
my Start Scene. I'm not going to need all of them. I'm just

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
going to change the text on a few. I'm only going to need one button.

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and I'm going to remove the

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Quit Button. change where the

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Start Button is going to go to the Start

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Scene. change the Text on a few things.

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
For example. I want to change this guy to

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
say. start again

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
or return to Start Menu or

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
"Return to Start".

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And  you'll notice that I'm going to have to change a few things. For example.

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
here the size of the box isn't

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
big enough. Note I'm

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
using Shift and rather Alt to

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
scale from the center. Here we go! I don't need a

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
subtitle here. and we are in our Win Scene.

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so let me delete this guy. And for my title.

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I'm just going to go "Congratulations. you have defeated

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
me. but I will rise again". So. this is

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
the Win Scene. so this is the Congratulatory Scene for the player.

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
[Hums] And I

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
need to spell this right. Here we go! "Congratulations.

you have defeated me

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000

Alright!

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Cool! So. now I've got this

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
new scene. that goes back to Start. We can

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
try it out. press play. click.

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and it does go back to the Start. And

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
now. what's going to happen next

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
is your going to do the rest of the scenes.

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
You're going to use this GDD to create a

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
bunch of buttons. on the Lose Screen.

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the Game Screen. to create the rest of the game. So

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that way I want the transitions to

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
look like those on this diagram. rather than to be

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the ones they have already. So. we've created this arrow.

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
between the Win Screen and the Start Menu. We've also created

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
an arrow between the Start Menu and the Game Scene.

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It's now up to you to create all the other arrows using

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
buttons. in your game. So. I'll see you when you're done all

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that and we will carry on and see what we

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
can make. out of this game. See you soon.

OK. have you

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
got a button. that does everything like that? Have we got all the buttons

151
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
sorted? Well. let's take a look at what I would do.

152
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Now. we're back in Unity. we've got this Win

153
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Scene sorted. we save it.

154
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
we jump into our Lose Scene.

155
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and we do pretty much the same thing. We

156
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
can just create another scene.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And we can do the same for the Game Scene. So now.

171
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
we've got this guy sorted. we've got the Lose

172
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Scene sorted. Let's take a look at the Win. let's change the color of

173
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
this guy a little bit.

174
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Looks good. that way we can very

175
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
easily distinguish the two scenes. and go

176
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
back to our Game Scene. So now. instead of back. I'm going to change that

177
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to Lose and Succeed.

178
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So. I'm going to

179
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
create a Lose Button. for now.

180
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And I'm going

181
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
to clone this guy. for a Succeed Button.

182
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
[Temporary Silence]

183
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Temporary Silence]

184
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Cool! So now. I just need

185
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to wire those guys up. instead of back to the Start Menu. I want them to

186
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
go to the Win and Lose.

187
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
[Typing Sound]

188
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And now. if I go back to my Start

189
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Scene. saving everything as I go and press

190
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
the Play Button. we should see that the game hangs together

191
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
as you'd expect.

192
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And that's exactly what we want. That's what we want out of this

193
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
video. is to get the flow of the game

194
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
going between all

195
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
the scenes. And you'll notice. I've really mocked the...

196
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I've created a mock scene. really. it's a fake

197
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
scene. I'm not playing a game at all here. I'm just saying I'm losing

198
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and I'm winning. and I'm creating the buttons here as a temporary

199
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
thing. to check that we can flow through the

200
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
entire Scene Diagram.

201
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And everything is wired up as we'd expect it. So. right now there's no

202
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
game. I haven't added the game yet. and we'll do that in another video.

203
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but I know now that I've got all those buttons to take

204
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
me from scene to scene. that it's all hanging together.

205
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and that we can create a cohesive game. And then. when we'll add

206
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
the game mechanic in another video. And that's pretty much it for this video.

207
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope you see the benefits of using a

208
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Game Design Document. and how we can really really use

209
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
a Game Design Document. when we're developing. to help us draw

210
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
a rough outline of the game like I've just done here.

211
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and to record all the decisions we're making. So cool!

212
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.733
I'll see you in another video! Bye for now!
