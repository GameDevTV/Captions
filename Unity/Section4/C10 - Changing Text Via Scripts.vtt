00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700


2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:13.700
We're going to change User Interface text using a script.

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:23.700
We want to do this

4
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:33.700
so we can change the ??? guess

5
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:43.700
We can can currently only play through the console

6
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:53.700
We're going to change the ??? text

7
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.100
NumberWizard.cs doesn't "know about" the text yet

8
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:09.100
There is no text element here

9
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:19.100
Add a public Text

10
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:29.100
public Text guessText;

11
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:39.100
This is defining a field (variable) in our class called guessText

12
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:49.100
Now Text is red because is a new element

13
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:59.100
that's being introduced with Unity 4.6

14
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:09.100
it's only available in the UnityEngine.UI "namespace".

15
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:19.100
Add using UnityEngine.UI at the top.

16
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:29.100
You see it auto-complete

17
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:39.100
You'll see the word Text turns blue

18
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.500


19
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.500
The Text object has a text property we can change

20
00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:03.500
Scroll to NextGuess()

21
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:13.500
add this code

22
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:23.500
use the . to auto-complete

23
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:33.500
set the text to guess (a numerical value) dot ToString (to convert to a string)

24
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:43.500
The UI text will be set to current guess

25
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:53.500
We also need to set the guess at the start

26
00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:03.500
add this code

27
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:13.500
again with .ToString() to convert int to string

28
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:23.500
The UI text will now update. How do we connect

29
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.266
this public guessText in the Editor?

30
00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:39.266
When we inspect NumberWizard, there's another item

31
00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:49.266
called Guess Text of type Text

32
00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:59.266
Simply drag the Guess object to this box

33
00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:09.266
Now the connection has been made.

34
00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:19.266
The guess now appears. Think of 725

35
00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:29.266
play the game

36
00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:39.266
We need to modify the behaviour when we press Equal

37
00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:49.266
we want to move to the Win Screen. We'll do that in another video.

38
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:55.032
Well done, you've got the text object dynamically updating!
