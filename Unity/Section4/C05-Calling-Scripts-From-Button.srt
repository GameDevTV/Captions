
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, and welcome back!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this video, we're going to be calling scripts

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
from buttons. So, we have our buttons in the scene

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
already, but we need them to act upon our

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
scene, to cause something, and to do that we'll need

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to write some scripts to handle our button

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
presses. So, we're going to create a bunch of new

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
scripts, we're going to add a bunch of functions to it to handle

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the different cases, and for us it's only going to be

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
a new level or rather load the game

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
than quit the game. And we're going to

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
call those functions from the buttons. And then,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we'll check that everything works out OK, by looking at the

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Console. So, let's get started! So, now

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we jump back into Unity, and the first thing we'll notice we'll have those two buttons,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the Start Button and the Quite Button, in our

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hierarchy. We can grab the Start Button,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
go down to the Button component in the Inspector,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and find the On Click () list, at the bottom. And it says list

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is empty. So, by default it doesn't do anything

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
whenever the button is clicked. We want to change that. So, how do we

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
change that? Well, what's the logical thing to do? We just click +

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and we can see three things come up. We have

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the Runtime Only, Editor And Runtime, and Off. That just

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
means when the button is active, when you can actually use it.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to keep it at Runtime Only. Then, we have the

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
None Object, and that's what object the

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
function is going to be called from or on. And then, we

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
have the function drop-down itself. Right now, because we have

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
no object, the function dropped down. You'll notice it... Oops!

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You'll notice it has no...

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It deactivated, now we want to drop in an

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
object here, a GameObject, and then, we can call functions on

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it. Now, we have no GameObject right now, to

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
manipulate the scenes and to quit the game. So,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think it's time we create our new object, so we create

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
an empty object, by right clicking the Hierarchy, and we

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
are going to call this new object a Level Manager.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
[Typing Sound]

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And our Level Manager is going to be

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
at position 0. I'm resetting the position,

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
because objects like this that have no

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
purpose, other than to have scripts attached to them, by

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
convention we add them at position 0 to make life easier

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
for ourselves. We don't want them to be all over the place in our

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
game space. So, we have a Level

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Manager, and then, now it's time to add a script to it.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, there are many ways you can do that. I'm just going to click the

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Add Component and click

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
on New Script and give it a new name. And the new name

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
of our script is also going to be Level Manager.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, that might be a little bit confusing, but the point

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
is this Level Manager Script is a component of the Level Manager

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Object right. So, here we go.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and it'll make sense when you start calling it

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
in your code, because it'll be nice and neat to

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
see the Level Manager start to do something. So, now we have this Level

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Manager, and we can see that the script has actually been created in

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
our Assets as well. If we look at the Project

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Folder, the Project Pane, we can see in our Assets we have a Level

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Manager C# script. So, that's great! We

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
can then start to edit the script, to add the

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
behavior we want. So, if I double click on this Level Manager script,

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
we can see two functions have been pre-created for us,

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the Start and the Update function. We don't want either of

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
those. We don't really want to use those. What we want to do is load the

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
new level. Basically, we want this Level Manager to be able to say

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
load the new level, so that when we click on the Start Button, we can

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
load the game level. That's the idea right, that's the aim

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
of the exercise. The aim of what we're doing right now is when we

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
are in this game, when we click play and press on the Start Buttton

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
we load the Game Scene. Right now, we're in the Start Scene,

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
which you can check by looking at the Title Bar, and we want to load

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the Game Scene, whenever we press the Start Button.  So,

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
let's jump back into our code and creat a new function. So, this

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
function is going to return absolutely nothing, and we're

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
going to call it Load Level. So, this

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
LoadLevel function has the job of loading a level. How

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
does it know which level to load? Well, we're going

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to give it a (string name), which is going

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to be the name of the level to load. And what do we want to

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
do with this name? Well, we want to do nothing, right now. We're just going to try

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and log it out to the Console, to make

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
sure that the function has been called properly. That's all we're going

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to do, and we're going to write a little message on our Console,

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
saying something like

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
("Level load requested

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
for: " and then,

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
+ the name. And now,

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
if we go back into our Unity Editor, we have

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the script, we have the script attached to a Level Manager Object,

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and now, we can drag this Level Manger Object

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
into our Start Button. So, we have a Start Button here.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We grab the Level Manager Object, from our Hierarchy

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and we drop it

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
into the slot that says None Object.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And now, you'll see immediately that the function drop-down

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
has become active. We can now click it

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and we can try and find our function, the LoadLevel

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
in our LevelManager function drop-down. Now, you'll

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
see a bunch of other things, including the Game Object the Transform, etc.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We don't care about all those functions, those are default functions or

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
default attributes, that have been created by Unity, for other

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
reasons but we only care about LoadLevel. So, why

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
is LoadLevel not coming up in our drop-down. Well, the reason

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
LoadLevel isn't coming up in our drop-down is, if we jump back

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
in, it's actually currently not public.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now, every function need to be

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
public, if it's going to be accessed outside of the class it's

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
in. So, if I put public here, as a

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
key word, before my function definition, that means

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
that will tell the compiler, I want this function to

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
be accessible to absolutely anyone that wants to

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
call it. This is public, everyone who wants to call Load

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Level can do so. Now, we can jump back into our

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Editor, and then now when we try the drop-down function,

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
we should see LoadLevel as a string coming

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
up in our drop-down. And once we've selected this

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
LoadLevel selected, we now can type

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
which level we want to load,

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
in the box that's created. And I've selected

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the Game Level, because I want to load the game

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
from my Start Button. Now, if I press play

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and select the Console and I

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
click on Start, we should see that some debug

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
code, the debug comes up

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
in the Console, to show us that the button has

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
actually been clicked properly.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, let's pause that, and now it is your turn.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Your turn to do exactly what I did, but instead of doing

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
it for the Start Button, do it for the Quit

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Button. And we're going to be using the same

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
LevelManager, but instead of calling the LoadLevel function,

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the Quit Button should call the quit request

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
function. So, the idea is that we have a quit request function

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
that is called, by the quit button, when you

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
press it. So, good luck and

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I will see you when you're done. See you very soon.

139

[Temporary Silence]

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, how did it go? Let

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
me take a look at what I would do

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to get that working. Firstly,

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I want to add the quit request

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
function into my class, you know I want to be able to

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
call quit request. I'm making sure I

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
make it public. I go Quit

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Request (), and it takes in

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
no arguments, because we don't need to say which

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
level we're quitting to, because quitting implies quitting the game.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So, now we go Debug.Log

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and we will...

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
...leave

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
a little message, write a little message to

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
the Console. Ah, let's call it

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
("I want to quit!");

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Here we go. And that will now

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
tell us that the Quit Button has been properly wired

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to the right place. If we jump back into our Editor,

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
we can then click on our Quit Button

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and we can then drag

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the new handler to our On Click (), drag our

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Level Manager into the open slot,

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
select the right function, and we want to select

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Quit Request, on the Level Manager.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now, why is Quit Request not here? Did I make a syntax

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
error in the code? Yes, I did! What did I

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
forget? I forgot the return type, which is void. I'm

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
returning nothing from my Quit Request.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So, now I should be able to call it.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And indeed, it does show up

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
in the drop-down. So, now I've got my Quit Request

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
sorted. Let's test it and see whether it works.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll press Start and we can see a

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
message come up in the Console. I press Quit and

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
a message comes up in the Console. And this

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
concludes our video on how to get

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
buttons to call functions

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
in scripts. I hope you learned something.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I hope you found it useful, and I will see you in another video!

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,866
Bye for now!
