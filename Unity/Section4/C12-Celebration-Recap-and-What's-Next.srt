00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So hi! Welcome to the

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
end of Number Wizard UI and congratulations for getting here! Well.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
well done on completing the Number Wizard. and

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
let's recap on what you've learned this section alright.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because you've learned quite a bit. So to start off with. you've created your

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
first menus. your first scenes. You've actually learned

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
about how to load scenes via your scripts.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You've also started learning about the User Interface.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
creating your own buttons. creating your own text. You've dug into

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
understanding the principles behind the User Interface. how

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the Canvas and the Event System and the actual items relate

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to each other. so lots and lots of learning. And you've

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
actually really built a really valuable asset. You're Menu System now is

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
actually something we're going to take on and develop of the course of the.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of the course. And in the next video.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we'll be reusing it and expanding it to do something

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
else. So. well done for getting this far. and

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
hope you've enjoyed it. Yeah. and also. you've done a load of dragging objects

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
into the Inspector. so you've been publicly exposing

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
things and then dragging into the Inspector. That's one

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
of two ways that you can find one GameObject from

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
another. The other is to do it directly within code. We've chosen

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
here to do it through the Inspector. Sometimes it make sense to do it there. sometimes

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it makes sense to do it in code. Now. remember the challenge structure here.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Remember that if you thought that you could do this on your own.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I hope you finished it and that you've just used this video.

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
at the end. to check that it's done and that you've complied with the Game Design Document.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Remember that you need to be doing the mini challenges! That's super

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
important. that's really where you're going to learn! And there's lots of

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
things actually you can do now. with this. Well. you have a Menu System.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
let's take it further. do something else with it. You've got a really

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
simple game. so make a more complex game. Make a logic game.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
make a logic puzzle. for example. or a series

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
about a game that asks Sphinx

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
riddles. asks riddles and asks for an answer to a given riddle.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You could build that. and you could also extend your Menu System

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to make it more exciting. make it more colorful.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Add images. trying that as a mini challenge. add images to your

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
menu. a background image or something like that.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Absolutely cool! What else? Game Design Document!

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
For the first time. the Game Design Document hopefully was useful here.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We started to get just complicated enough that. when I was coding

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it. I felt I needed to draw a little picture. So. that's the idea with the

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Game Design Document. I want you to start thinking away from it

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
being something we give that you follow and more towards the

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
idea that it's something you create for yourself. while you're making

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the game. Starting with just an outline and some sketches.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
as to what the idea is. And then. as you go. when you get to a

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
bit you think. well this is a bit complex how am I going to do it? That's

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
when you draw yourself a sketch in the Game Design Document.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
That's the purpose of that. It's a support. it's a live document

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to support you and help you. as a game developer. to build the product you

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
really want. so yeah. Absolutely! And that's it really.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Again. if you have any technical issues ask against the actual lecture.

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
on Udemy in the discussions. and we'll be sure to answer.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Or you'll find that one of your fellow students may have answered before

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
we do. And please. you are a fellow student. so if you

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
see somebody asking a question you know the answer to. just dive

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
in and help them. It really helps us and it really helps you create

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
a sense of community and support. So. well done

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and I'll see you in the next section! See you soon!
