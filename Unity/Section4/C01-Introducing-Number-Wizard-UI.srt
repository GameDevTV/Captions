00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, Hi and welcome to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Number Wizard UI! So, in this game, we're going to take what

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we did last time, which is the Number Wizard game, a number guessing game,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and turn it into UI. Get it to be visual, get it to be

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
interesting for the player. And it's the first time you're going to be meeting

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the Unity Editor. So far, we've only stayed in the Console,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but now, we're going to dig into the actual visual

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
editor, create scenes, and create menus for your game,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which is going to be quite fun! And for the first time, you're going to see all those other

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
bits of Unity: The Scene Tab, the Game Tab, the Hierarchy,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the Assets Tab, the Inspector.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, we've hidden that before. We literally put

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
MonoDevelop over the top of it, so we didn't scare you off. Now,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
we're going to start making use of that stuff! You're going to build your first UI

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or User Interface. You're going to have menu buttons, etc. We're going to run

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
all those forward, through the future sections, so we're going to start to build a reusable

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Menu System now, which we're going to want to use for every game. By the way,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we want you to... Pretty much the first thing you do when you

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
make a game is, let's get you making the menu system,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and make the navigation around the game from the Start Screen

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to a place holder game screen, to a Lose or a Win

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Screen. Let's get that in place first, because that's a thing, at the

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
end of the project... It's such a common excuse,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
for not shipping right. Yeah, you'll really want to get that

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
working straight away, so that you can't have an excuse of oh

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I could finish this game, if only I had a menu. Well, add the menu

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
at the beginning, that way when you get to that point you've got a finished game, which is really

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
very important actually. Absolutely, and it gives you a really nice kind of context

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and structure. It makes you think about the flow of your game,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
from the beginning. So, it's like doing a jigsaw, by doing all the pieces around the outside

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
first, which makes sense. So, let's get the Menu Systems in place, start getting

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
confident with that, and it's going to get great! It's going to be a great section!

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
By the way, the learning curve in this course,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it starts off very very shallow, so you might find it really easy in the beginning.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you do, just watch out because it's going to get steeper

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and steeper, as we introduce more and more concepts, so stay with it.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If it's a little bit slow for you, just go through it fast. If it's too hard, go back

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
a little bit or just take it slow, but you're going to be fine. It's going to be

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
a good section and we'll see you soon. Good luck and have fun doing this section!

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
See you soon!
