00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.733
Hello and welcome back! In this video

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:11.733
we're going to look at how to change User Interface text

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.700
directly. using a script. So that's you changing the text

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.666
on our scene. using a script. And we've got our Number

6
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.666
Wizard game here. and the reason we want to do this

7
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:27.666
is. so that we can change the guess on our

8
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:31.666
game page to reflect what Number Wizard is doing. Right now.

9
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.633
we can play it through the Console but we're not seeing it in the scene. so you still need the Console

10
00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:39.633
to play the game. So we're going to change that by getting this number we're

11
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:43.633
selecting. this number we're guessing. so say 121 to appear

12
00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:47.633
in the scene itself next to the choices

13
00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:51.666
we can make. So how are we going to do this? Well the first thing

14
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:55.700
we need to do is to get Number Wizard to change the text.

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.100
but Number Wizard doesn't know about the text. If we ever look at the script.

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.133
the Number Wizard script doesn't have a text element

17
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:07.133
in it at all. It doesn't talk about text or anything like that. so what we're going to do is

18
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:11.166
we're going to add one. We're going to add

19
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:15.200
a public

20
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.200
TEXT...

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.233
Not Texture but Text.

22
00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:27.200
A public Text guessText.

23
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.233
So what. what this is saying is.

24
00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:35.200
we have a field in our class that is a

25
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.200
text item. which we're going to call guessText.

26
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.233
And now it's coming up red. and the reason it's coming up red. and you can definitely see it if

27
00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:47.266
you're say trying to build the project. it'll give you an error.

28
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:51.266
Because text is a new element that is being introduced with Unity

29
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:55.233
4.6. it's not a Text Mesh as before in 4.5. It's

30
00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:59.200
a new type of object and it's only available

31
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.233
in the UnityEngine.UI

32
00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:07.233
namespace. So how are we going to get that? Well to introduce a

33
00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:11.233
new namespace into our program we go at the top of the program and

34
00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:15.233
go using UnityEngine

35
00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:19.266
.UI.

36
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:23.266
And you see it'll come up in the autocomplete. to show you that. in fact.

37
00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:27.300
UI is one of the possible options you have. And when you do that and

38
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.333
try and build again or just leave it. you'll see immediately the text becomes

39
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:35.300
blue again. to show you that the text is now defined within

40
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.300
this code. So now we have this public Text object.

41
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.500
so how are we going to change that Text object? Well

42
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.533
we're going to change it by changing its

43
00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:51.500
Text property. So the Text object has a Text property.

44
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.500
which we can change. So let's go. Where should we change

45
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.533
it? Well we should really change the guess whenever the guess is updated. whenever the

46
00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:03.533
guesses change which is really the next guess method. So in the

47
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:07.566
next guess method. once we've finished our guess. we go

48
00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:11.600
guessText and it'll give

49
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.633
you the field in the autocomplete. dot. and it'll

50
00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:19.600
let you find text. And then. we can simply set

51
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.633
the text to whatever we want. and right now we'll set it to

52
00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:27.633
the guess. which is a numerical value. dot

53
00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:31.600
ToString() and this will convert the numerical value to a string.

54
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.600
So now we have the guessText. which represents the

55
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.600
User Interface text being set to the current guess we

56
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.600
have in our Number Wizard. Number Wizard also needs

57
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600
to set the text. when it gets started. So in every new game.

58
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.633
we should definitely start with it setting the text. so let's

59
00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:55.666
do that straight away in the StartGame () function. Let's do

60
00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:59.666
guessText

61
00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:03.700
.text is my guess ToString().

62
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.700
Here we go! So

63
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.666
now. if we pass in a Text object to our Number Wizard.

64
00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:15.633
it'll update the Text object to reflect to the guess

65
00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:19.666
that we're making. at any one time. So how would this

66
00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:23.700
work in the Editor? How do we connect this public Text property

67
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.266
of the NumberWizard object in our Editor? Well let's take a look!

68
00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:33.266
In the Editor. when we inspect the Number Wizard now.

69
00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:37.233
you see that the script has another item in the Inspector.

70
00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:41.233
So if you have a look in the Inspector. the Number Wizard script or the Number Wizard object

71
00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:45.200
now has a new item called Guess Text. and it's telling you there is

72
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.166
no current item selected but it's of type (Text). So we simply need to

73
00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:53.166
drag and drop a Text object into that

74
00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:57.200
box. So we can grab our guess and drag

75
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.233
it into our box. and now you see. there's a (Text)

76
00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:05.200
object in our box. it's Guess. It's called Guess.

77
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.166
it is a (Text) type. And now. if we play the game.

78
00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:13.166
click play. the guess now appears!

79
00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:17.133
And it should be reflected that whenever we change higher or lower. Let's

80
00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:21.100
pick 725. Higher. Lower.

81
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.100
Higher. Higher. and it indeed does reflect the

82
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.066
current guess. and when you

83
00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:33.066
press Equal it restarts. Now. the behavior when you

84
00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:37.033
press Equal is not the current behavior we want. we want to change that. When you press Equal. you should be

85
00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:41.066
moved to the next scene. to the winning scene the Win Screen.

86
00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:45.066
but that's the topic of another video. Right now. you've managed.

87
00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:49.100
so far. to get a Text object updated dynamically

88
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.100
via script in your scene. So well done. and I'll see

89
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.033
you in the next video!

in the scene itself next to the choices

13
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:51,666
we can make. So how are we going to do this? Well the first thing

00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,100

a public

TEXT...

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,233
Not Texture but Text.

22
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:27,200
A public Text guessText.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,233
So what, what this is saying is,

24
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:35,200
we have a field in our class that is a

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
text item, which we're going to call guessText.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,233
And now it's coming up red, and the reason it's coming up red, and you can definitely see it if

27
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:47,266
you're say trying to build the project, it'll give you an error.

28
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:51,266
Because text is a new element that is being introduced with Unity

29
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:55,233
4.6, it's not a Text Mesh as before in 4.5. It's

30
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:59,200
a new type of object and it's only available

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,233
in the UnityEngine.UI

32
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:07,233
namespace. So how are we going to get that? Well to introduce a

33
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:11,233
new namespace into our program we go at the top of the program and

34
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:15,233
go using UnityEngine

35
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:19,266
.UI.

36
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:23,266
And you see it'll come up in the autocomplete, to show you that, in fact,

blue again, to show you that the text is now defined within

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,300
this code. So now we have this public Text object,

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,500
so how are we going to change that Text object? Well

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,533
we're going to change it by changing its

43
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,500
Text property. So the Text object has a Text property,

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
which we can change. So let's go. Where should we change

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,533
it? Well we should really change the guess whenever the guess is updated, whenever the

46
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:03,533
guesses change which is really the next guess method. So in the

47
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:07,566
next guess method, once we've finished our guess, we go

48
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:11,600
guessText and it'll give

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,633
you the field in the autocomplete, dot, and it'll

50
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,600
let you find text. And then, we can simply set

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,633
the text to whatever we want, and right now we'll set it to

52
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:27,633
the guess, which is a numerical value, dot

53
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:31,600
ToString() and this will convert the numerical value to a string.

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
So now we have the guessText, which represents the

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
User Interface text being set to the current guess we

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
have in our Number Wizard. Number Wizard also needs

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
to set the text, when it gets started. So in every new game,

58
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,633
we should definitely start with it setting the text, so let's

59
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:55,666
do that straight away in the StartGame () function. Let's do

60
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,666
guessText

61
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,700
.text is my guess ToString().

62
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Here we go! So

63
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,666
now, if we pass in a Text object to our Number Wizard,

64
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,633
it'll update the Text object to reflect to the guess

65
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:19,666
that we're making, at any one time. So how would this

66
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,700
work in the Editor? How do we connect this public Text property

67
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,266
of the NumberWizard object in our Editor? Well let's take a look!

68
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:33,266
In the Editor, when we inspect the Number Wizard now,

69
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:37,233
you see that the script has another item in the Inspector.

70
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:41,233
So if you have a look in the Inspector, the Number Wizard script or the Number Wizard object

71
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:45,200
now has a new item called Guess Text, and it's telling you there is

72
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,166
no current item selected but it's of type (Text). So we simply need to

73
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:53,166
drag and drop a Text object into that

74
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:57,200
box. So we can grab our guess and drag

75
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,233
it into our box, and now you see, there's a (Text)

76
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:05,200
object in our box, it's Guess. It's called Guess,

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,166
it is a (Text) type. And now, if we play the game,

78
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:13,166
click play, the guess now appears!

79
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:17,133
And it should be reflected that whenever we change higher or lower. Let's

80
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:21,100
pick 725. Higher, Lower,

81
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Higher, Higher, and it indeed does reflect the

82
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,066
current guess, and when you

83
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:33,066
press Equal it restarts. Now, the behavior when you

84
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,033
press Equal is not the current behavior we want, we want to change that. When you press Equal, you should be

85
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:41,066
moved to the next scene, to the winning scene the Win Screen,

86
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:45,066
but that's the topic of another video. Right now, you've managed,

87
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:49,100
so far, to get a Text object updated dynamically

88
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,100
via script in your scene. So well done, and I'll see

89
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,033
you in the next video!
