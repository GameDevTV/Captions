00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi and welcome to this video!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this video, we're going to be looking at how to

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
add a Start Button to our scene and make it respond

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to our mouse click. In particular, we want to

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
have the button change color, when we

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
hover over it with the mouse, and we want to

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
have the button change color, whenever it's clicked.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, we're going to use a Text Element as a button, to do that.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, let's get started. So, I'll

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
jump straight into Unity, and here we have our scene.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Right now, it's missing two buttons, a Start and

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
a Quit button, so that's what we're going to add now. To do that, the first thing

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to do is, I'm going to change the name of these Text Elements. These Text

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Elements are not really named very well, so I'm just

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
going to rename them, to know what they are. I'm going to call this

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
one Title and the one underneath Subtitle.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't forget to

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
press Return. If you don't press Return, this change won't take effect.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And finally, I'm going to add a new

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
UI object text, from my Game

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Object Menu, and you'll see the text come up.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going to drag it underneath, and I'm going to rename

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
this one Start Button.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
[Typing Sound]

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So, I've got this Start Button here, I'm going to change

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the text to Start,

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
as you'd expect. Change the color

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to white, by default.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I'm going to also

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
make it a little bit bigger and center it. So, centering it

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
first, and then, make the Font Size a bit bigger.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How's that? That looks good!

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's now positioned and we have

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
what will become our button. So, right now it's

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
just text. So, how do I turn it into a button? Well, I can

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
click Add Component, and if I look at my

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Component Hierarcy I can go to UI and then,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
there will be a Button component.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, I can click the Button Component, and here we

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
have a interactable button attached

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to... Oops, that's not attched to the right thing, that's attached to our Canvas.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Look we've got the Canvas selected

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and I've added a Button Script to it. [Laughs] Not quite what I

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
wanted to do! So, let me remove that component and select the right thing, which

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
is my Start Button, which I've miss-spelled. That's not

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Strart, it's just Start Button. [Laughs] I think that's a much better name for it.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, now I want to add a component to my Start

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Button. So, UI Button

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to my Start Button, and now everything in there, it'll automatically

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
find the right target graphic, it'll find the buttons.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And we've got a bunch of stuff, and then, it'll have this box of,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
this OnClick () box, which will let it carry

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
our actions, whenever it's clicked. Now, if I press Play,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
if I move my mouse over this button,

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
absolutely nothing happens. Can you see that? Nothing at

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
all happens. We want to change that, so what we're going to be doing is we're going

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
to use the Transition Attribute of our button

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
script, and we're going to select the color tint. So, now there's

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
three options or four.  None, which means nothing happens, Color

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Tint, which means you change the color overlay slightly,

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and then, Sprite Swap, which means you change the actual sprite,

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
underlying the button, and finally, Animation, which let's you play an

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
animation, whenever one of those states is triggered. We're going to use

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Color Tint, because it's very simple. No more color is going to remain

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
white. Highlighted color, I'm going to give it a

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
nice bright green, to make it very clear,

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that we've highlighted it, and then, press Color. I'm going to

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
choose a deep orange. In fact, I'm going to go

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
more towards the red than usual, because remember

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
this is a tint, so it's on top of the existing color,

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
rather than as a replacement.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So, now if I press play, and go into my game,

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I hover over it, and it goes green.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I click it and it goes orange, and that's the kind of behavior I

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
am looking for. Now, it is somewhat buggy

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
sometimes, depending on which version of Unity you are in, and

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
sometimes, when you click, you'll see here that the hover color

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
remains. This is a known bug with Unity.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't worry too much, it doesn't effect

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
too many versions, but that is something to keep in

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
mind, and there are work-arounds if you need them.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But for now, that's sufficiently good for us. We have a Start Button,

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and now it is your turn.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is what I want you to do now. I want you to add a quick

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
button. Same as the Start Button, but instead of having a Start

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Button called Start Button, I want a Quit Button

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
called Quit Button, that has the same kind of behavior as my

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Start Button. I'll see you very soon, when you've sorted that out.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
[Temporary Silence]

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So, I'm going to cheat a little bit to add my Quit

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Button. I'm going to go back into my Unity,

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and instead of actually creating

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
a Quit Button, I'm going to duplicate my Start Button!

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
My shortcut for duplicating on a Mac is Command D.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not quite sure what it is on Windows, but you can also

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I believe, use the menu and use

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Duplicate, when you have it on the right

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
click, for your menu. Now, I've got two Start Buttons, I don't want

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
that many. Bring the second one down, let me rename

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
it to Quit Button.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And I've got a Quit Button now.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't forget you need to press

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Return, once you have renamed,

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
renamed your entity. And I'm going to change

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
change this to Quit. And now,

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
if I go back to my page, and I play the game

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
we now have two buttons that respond to mouse hover,

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
respond to clicks, and

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
change their

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
colors. And that is it for this video! We

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
have now created buttons. We know how to create menu...

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
at least text buttons, and we'll be looking at other

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
types of buttons in future videos, but for now, that

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is sufficiently good for us to create our

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Number Wizard UI game. So, I'll see you in the next video.
