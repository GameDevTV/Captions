Hello and welcome back! In this video we're
going to be looking at creating new scenes

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:16,850
and levels in Unity. So, what do I mean by
that? Well, Unity has the concept of scenes

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,630
and you'll often hear it used interchangeably
with the word level, so levels and scenes

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,880
in Unity essentially mean the same. And we're
going to creating some levels and scenes,

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,400
to show you how to structure your game. So,
let me give you a couple examples of how scenes

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,219
and level could be used in your game. Let's
say you have a side scroller and you have

00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:41,590
the dangerous castle, that could be an independent
level. And then, you could have the dangerous

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,820
plains, that would be a different level. Those
are how you would structure your game, you'd

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,120
have one scene for each of those levels. And
you might have scenes fort things like the Start Menu or the Splash

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,590
Screen or also the Options Menu. So, you can
basically use scenes to structure the game in

00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,370
that way. So, here's what we're going to do
together. We're first going to create a 2D

00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,799
project. In fact, you're going to be doing
that right now, so create a new 2D project

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,670
in Unity, and you should end up having something
like this, in front of you. So, let's take

00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,119
a look. Firstly, I want to draw your attention
to the very top of that window, which is the

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,670
title bar, so you'll see Untitled - some name,
and that's going to be the name of your project,

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,659
or at least the name of the folder, where
you save your project. Then, a dash then PC,

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,229
Mac, Linux stand alone or some other build
option. So, let me give you a little bit of

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:40,509
the structure of what you're seeing here.
The first thing, before the first dash, that's

00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:45,920
the name of the scene you're currently editing.
Between the two dashes, that's the name of

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,990
the project or the folder your project is
saved in, and then, after the last dash, that's

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,960
the name of the build setting you have, so
I'm currently setup to build for PC, Mac,

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,369
and Linux, as a stand alone build. So, now
we've got this going. How do we create a new

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:10,110
scene? Well, it's quite simple, we go into
Unity, we select File, and we create New Scene,

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,599
and that will bring us to a completely new
scene that's untitled and to actually save

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,480
that scene as a file we go, File, Save Scene,
and notice that you can also use the shortcuts

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,640
that will appear on the right of the menu
items. So, you click on Save Scene and it'll

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,500
bring up the Save Scene Menu, where you can
type the name of the scene. We're going to

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,170
start with a start scene, quite originally,
and now you can see that the scene has now

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:42,140
appeared in your Assets Pane, at the bottom
of your screen, as a Unity icon in the Assets

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,280
Pane. And you'll also notice that the Title
Bar has changed, once you've saved the scene.

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,140
The scene name now appears in the Title Bar,
with a little Unity icon as well. So, that's

00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:01,170
pretty simple, that's how we create scenes
in Unity, and now it is your turn. We want

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,470
you to create three new scenes, in the same
manner, so you're going to pause this video

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,510
and you're going to create three new scenes
called Game, Lose, and Win. And we will see

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:21,900
each other once you're done, so see you very soon. So, hi and welcome back! How

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,129
did you get on? Did you manage to create your
three new scenes? Let's get going and see

00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:33,610
how we do that. I will just go File, New Scene,
and then, I'm going to use my shortcut, which

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:43,620
is Command Save and that would go Game. And
I can create a new scene. I can use Command

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,819
N and then Command Save, that's going to be
Lose. Command New and you'll see that the

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,950
Title Bar changes, Save and then finally the
Win Scene. And now you'll see you in my Console

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,019
in the Assets in my Project Pane, all four
scenes I want to create, and then, finally

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,909
I'm going to go File, Save Project, to save
my entire project  to disk. And that's

00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:18,040
how you create new scenes and levels in Unity.
I hope it was very clear and you now can create

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,370
new scenes for yourselves, and I will see
you very shortly in the next video! Bye for

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:22,710
now!
