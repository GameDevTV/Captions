00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello. and welcome

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
back! In this video. we're going to be looking at how

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to load scenes and to quit the game.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We're going to be using some new functions. that we've not met before. that's the Application

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
.LoadLevel() and Application.Quit()

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
functions. to load new levels and to quit the game

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in our script. So. we've already got a script in the

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
game. that gets triggered whenever we press a button. and we want to

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
make that. actually not just log to the Console. but actually

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
carry out the actions we want. And once we've done that

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we'll look a litttle bit more about the limitations of Application

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
.Quit. because it doesn't quite work in

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
all contexts. If we use Application.Quit.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
say in the web. it's not going to have any effect. and we'll see that

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we'll list all the things that Application.Quit can't do

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and where it doesn't quite work the way we expect. So.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
let's go straight to the game and

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
jump in. So. we've got our Unity

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Editor right here and we've got our game. and right now

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I've got a Start Game. which I'm in right now. and some

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
empty games elsewhere. And what I want to do is.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
for my Start Button. so when I click it

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
instead of logging something out to the Console. as it does... Now. let's take a look.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I press play. I open my Console.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I press Start. and we should see that

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
something gets logged out to the Console. and

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that's all it does right now. Instead. of doing that. I want my Start Button

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to take me to my next scene. And we already

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
have a LevelManager. that gets called.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
whenever we actually

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
press the button. and the only thing it does right now is to

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
log something right. And we've got it

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
loading a request for game. and we set that.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The thing we want to do is to turn the

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
click that clicks on the Start Button.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
instead of going to a logging to actually

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
do something. Well. how do we do that? Welll. we can just use the

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Application.LoadLevel. So. the

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Application.LoadLevel. you'll see it being auto completed.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's actually right here. LoadLevel is a method.

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and we can pass in the name of the level.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we want to load. So. by just adding this line.

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
this Application.LoadLevel new name. and give it

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the name. that will then take our

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Start Button. whenever we press it. and it will take us to

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
our Game Scene. So. let's take a look at that in action.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I jump back into Unity. I press Play.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and then. if I click Start

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
LoadLevel Game -1 could not

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
be loaded. because it has not been added to the Build Settings.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I don't know whether you can see that through the Play Tint. so let me pause the game.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You can see this big bright red arrow with a

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
exclamation mark. Something went wrong! So. what went wrong?

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Well. what's actually going on is we started to play a game

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and we tried to LoadLevel but it wasn't prepared. We

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
need to tell Unity. these are the levels that you prepare

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and these are the levels that you should be ready to jump to. Right click doesn't

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
know. So. how do we do that? Well. that's in our Build Settings.

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So. we can go File. Build Settings. or we can

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
use the shortcut shown in the menu. So. if we go to the File

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Menu and go Build Settings. we'll have this window pop-up and open.

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And we can see a bunch of options in the Platform.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you can see all the builds of Unity. everything from Windows

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Phone to the web. And really we don't really care about

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
this right now. we're going to stick with the PC. Mac. and Linux

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Standalone Build. which is what we're currently on. but what we can

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
notice is that the Scenes in Build list

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
is actually completely empty. So. you can see the scene here.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the scenes in Build. That's empty and that's a problem.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Basically. what we're saying here is. no scenes should be put together

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
when you build a game. which is not what we mean. So.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
how do we add scenes in Build? Well. we go to our projects. we

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
select the scenes. and I'm going to select all of them at once.

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and then. I can drag my scenes into

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
my scene list. And the order matters

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
here. because the order is actually relevant. The first

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
one in the order will be the first one to be run. So.

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
when we've got an order. right now. we can then select

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the Start Scene. for example. Click it.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and then. we can drag it to the top. And I'm just

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
moving stuff around until the Start Scene is at the top.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Now. in any build I make. the Start Scene will be the

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
first to be loaded. and then. my Start Scene will continue

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
as normal. So. now I've got this; I don't need to build. I don't need to

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
buld and run. I can just close this window. once I've created

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
my scene list. and then press play again.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And when I click Start. we should see that we now jump to a different

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
scene. And obviously. this is an empty scene. there's not distinguishing

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
feature between my Game. Lose. and Win Scene.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Right now. the only scene that has anything in it is the Start Scene.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We can see the Start Button has actually done its job to

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
jump us to another scene. So.

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
awesome! It is now your turn!

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
What I want you to do is... Now. we can jump to the Start Scene.

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We are not going to worry about Quit right now. but what I want

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
you to do is. create a button

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
to return to the Start Scene. from the Game Scene.

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now. we can jump from the Start Scene. to the Game Scene. I want

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
us to be able to jump backwards. from the Game to the Start Scene.

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and I want you to create a new button. that's going to do that for us.

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So. use what you've learned already. use the

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
code that's already there. You don't need to rewrite the LevelManager.

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
you don't need to rewrite the LevelManager Object. or the Level

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Manager Script. You can just use Control

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
C or Command C to copy them. and then.

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
paste them in the new scene. So. you'll need to grab the existing

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
LevelManager. and copy that across to your

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
new scene. And then. also create a new button

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in your new scene. that takes us back. and that's just going to be a little

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
little Debug Button. as an exercise for us. so we can jump

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
back and forth between those two scenes. So. I'll see you very soon.

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
[Temporary Silence]

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
[Temporary Silence]

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So. how did it go? Did you manage to get a button that jumps back from

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the Game Scene to the Start scene? Let's see

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
how we would do that. So. I'm now in my

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Unity Editor. and I've got my Start

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
scene here. What I want to copy is my LevelManager

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and my Start Button. So. I will not worry about the Start Button too much for

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
now. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to grab the LevelManager.

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
copy it. and then open my Game scene.

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and then paste it in. So. I click again on the Hierarchy.

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
paste it in. and I can see the LevelManager turning up in my

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Hierarchy. in the Game scene. as well.

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Now. I need a button. I need a button in my scene right now. So. how do

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I do that? Well. I can either do a

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
create a new button. by going Game Object.

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
UI. and then. create a text. and then to all the

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
button addition and stuff like that again. or

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I can cheat again. I copy my button across. So. I'm going

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to save my game. jump back into my Start Scene.

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
grab my button and my

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Event System. because remember. we need an Event System.

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and my Canvas. Copy them across

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to my Game Scene

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and paste them in. Here we go. now

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I've got a Canvas and I've got all sorts of stuff in there. The only thing I

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
actually want is one of the buttons. I'm going to remove everything

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
else. delete them.

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and use my Quit Button. rename it to

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Back Button.

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And change the text

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and then. go

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
to my handler. and now it's missing. because we've

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
copied them separately. So. I'm going to grab my LevelManager

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and put it

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
in my Back Button. So. I get my LevelManager. drag it

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
into my On Click () Handler. for my Back Button. if

149
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
it lets me. Here we go! And then. select the

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
right function. which is LevelManager. LoadLevel.

151
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and this time instead of loading Game. I'm obviously going to

152
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
be loading a diferent one. which is Start. So. now if I

153
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
press the game. I go back to my Start scene. Don't forget

154
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
to save your changes to the Game scene.

155
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I press play. and then I click on Start.

156
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I've got my Game scene right here. and then. I press back and

157
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I'm back on my Start scene. And that's kind of what we were expecting.

158
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
how to go back and forth. using buttons and Load

159
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Level. So. that's awesome! What's the next thing to do? Well. the next

160
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
thing to do is to get Quit to work and look at

161
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
a bit more about how Quit works and what we can do with Quit.

162
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So. it's pretty simple. in terms of the code. Quit

163
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is just another application function. and we can use Application

164
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
.Quit

165
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and that will do exactly what we expect it to

166
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
generally. So. we've got an Application.Quit();

167
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We can save and then. we can jump back

168
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and try it out in our Editor. and we'll see what the effect

169
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
is. So. now you press Quit.

170
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I've got the request coming up. you can see it in the Console.

171
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
however my application doesn't pause.

172
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Why is that? Well. we've just hit the first limitation of our

173
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Application.Quit. Application.Quit works

174
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
great. if you're making a build. Application

175
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
.Quit works great. if you're making a build for the PC

176
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and the consoles.

177
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
however it is limited on the Web Build

178
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and the Debug

179
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Build. So. this is the debug build. this is kind of the debug in Editor

180
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Build. and Quit will have no effect. in that case. It will

181
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
also have no effect if you're in the web. If you create a web

182
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
plugin and

183
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
you use the web plugin. then you're web build will have no

184
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Application.Quit. Clicking it will have no effect. It's

185
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
also really important to understand that while it will have an effect on

186
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
mobile phone platforms. so if you have iOS.

187
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Android. or Windows. most of those platforms.

188
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
form the guidelines for app

189
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
developers. means that you shouldn't quit your application youself. You should

190
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
have the player and the operating system

191
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
manage the application state. in which case Application.Quit

192
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is actually a bad pattern to fall into.

193
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
It's a bad practice. and if you try and submit an

194
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
application to the app store. with a Quit Button. it'll actaully

195
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
be rejected. for example. on the iOS app store.

196
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So. those are the little limitations of Application.Quit.

197
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
but now. we at least we can try and build a new

198
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
build. So. we go into File. Build.

199
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Build Settings. grab the right one. click

200
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Build and Run. I'll just select

201
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
a random location. I don't really care where it's loaded. I just want to

202
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
show you the example. And I'm

203
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
going to choose a random

204
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
graphics size. and there we go. we've got our app.

205
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Powered by Unity. etc.. etc.

206
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And we should see our first scene. "Welcome to Number Wizard Puny Human!".

207
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And if I press Quit here. it will actually take

208
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
me back to my Desktop. as we expect

209
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
it to. which is great! So. that's just to show you the Application.Quit

210
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Button. working as you'd expect it to.

211
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So. what's next? Well.

212
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
let's take a review of a little bit of how we load the scene.

213
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
how all this is wired together. So. if you remember. we have

214
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
two objects. so those are game level objects. Those are

215
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
the Start Button and the LevelManager; those are the actual things we're moving

216
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
around with. and we can see them in the Editor in

217
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
our Start Scene. For example. this is a LevelManager Object

218
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and this is the Start Button Object. right here

219
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
in the Hierarchy. Now. if we do

220
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
go into those objects. they each have

221
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
a component. The Start Button has a Button Componeent and the LevelManager

222
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
has a LevelManager Componenet. And we can also see this in our

223
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Editor. if we jump back. We can see that when we have the Level

224
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Manager selected. the components all showed in the

225
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Inspector. So. we've got a Transform Component. which is default for all objects.

226
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and then. we have a LevelManager Script Component and that's the

227
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
component we're talking about. Similarly. the Start Button has a

228
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Button Component. and

229
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
inside of its Inspector. We can look at the Inspector here. it has

230
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
several components. including a Transform. a Canvas

231
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Renderer. a Text. etc.. and a Button Script

232
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Component. So. those are the components.

233
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
If we jump back. what the Start Button's

234
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Component also has an On Click () Event Handler.

235
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and that's represented in the Unity Editor.

236
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
At the bottom there's...

237
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
at the bottom of the Button Component. there's an On Click ()

238
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
list. and we can change that and add things to it. So. right now we have

239
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
a reference to the LevelManager Object. which is this

240
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
guy here. in the Hierarchy. and we

241
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
also have a reference to a function

242
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
we want to call. So. tha's the next thing we want to think of.

243
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
is there is now a function in LevelManager.

244
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And what happens is. the On Click Event Handler has

245
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
the reference to that function. and whenever the button is clicked

246
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
it actually calls it. So. that's actually what's happening in the

247
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
game and how things are wired together. in our scene.

248
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
OK awesome! I hope it's been useful.

249
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I hope you can see how to wire things together now. and

250
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
how to create buttons that quit and change scenes.

251
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And you also know a little bit more about the limitations

252
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
of the quit function. in Appliation.Quit.

253
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Hope you've enjoyed this video. and I will see you in another one!

254
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.166
Bye for now!
