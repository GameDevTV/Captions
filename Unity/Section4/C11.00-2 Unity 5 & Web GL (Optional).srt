00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.300
Welcome I'm Sam! You may not have heard my voice before.

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.300
but I'm going to be in this lecture. showing you how to upgrade

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.300
the Number Wizard project to Unity 5. And we're going

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.300
to exploit this. to enable us to upload that as a Web GL

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.300
game. which means that you don't need to install plugins when

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.300
uploading it to Game Bucket. That means your family can try it without installing plugins! How great is that?!

7
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.766
So. let's see how we do that by jumping right in!

8
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.766
So. you'll notice that I have

9
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:40.766
these two versions of Unity again. Unity 4.7.1

10
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:44.766
and Unity 5.3.2. You can do this on

11
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:48.766
a PC or a Mac. just by renaming the folders before installing a new version of Unity.

12
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:52.766
that will ensure that you keep the old version rather than updating it in place.

13
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.766
So. we're going to open up Unity 5. and

14
00:00:56.766 --> 00:01:00.766
use that to import our Number Wizard UI project.

15
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:04.766
So. I already have a bunch of projects open here. but I'm going to open a new

16
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:08.766
one. and I'm going to select the folder and hit Open.

17
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:12.766
Now. you'll notice that it pops up with this dialog box.

18
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:16.766
asking whether we want to upgrade with Unity's cleaver upgrading tool.

19
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:20.766
So. we're going to say yes to the Upgrade.

20
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.766
and let it go through its quick upgrade process.

21
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:28.766
It does some cleaver things. reaches into scripts and even changes the API's there.

22
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:32.766
in order to make your game fully compatible.

23
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:36.766
So. let's check that this works! We'll go into our Game scene

24
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:40.766
and then go and hit the play button.

25
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.766
OK. this does indeed seem to be working. Let me just increase

26
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:48.766
the size here. In fact. I'm just going to maximize this tab.

27
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:52.766
And here we go. we have

28
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:56.766
our UI and our buttons.

29
00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.766
and as you can see. we can indeed

30
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:04.766
play the game as expected.

31
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:08.766
Now. I just want to show you one more thing. which is new in

32
00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:12.766
Unity 5. and that's being able to export this to a Web

33
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:16.766
GL build. So. we're going to do a Build & Run.

34
00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:20.766
and then. we're going to select. as

35
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:24.766
our platform. the WebGL platform.

36
00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:28.766
And let's just hit Build.

37
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:32.766
and we're going to create a build directory here. So. I'm going to create a new

38
00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:36.766
folder. Build like so.

39
00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:40.766
And I'm going to call this Number

40
00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:44.766
WizardUI. like so.

41
00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.766
Hit save and then just let it run

42
00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:52.766
through its build process. which will take about up to 5 minutes. depending

43
00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:56.766
on how fast your machine is. but what this is doing is it's taking all of

44
00:02:56.766 --> 00:03:00.766
the C#. turning it into an intermediate language.

45
00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:04.766
In fact. the intermediate language is C++. and then. it's turning that intermediate

46
00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:08.766
C++ into JavaScript. which is the language that can be run

47
00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:12.766
in your web browser. And it uses all sorts of cool new

48
00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:16.766
HTML 5 API's in your web browser. to allow you

49
00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:20.766
to do 3D graphics without the need for any plugins.

50
00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:24.766
So. you can run this in any browser that supports WebGL. Most modern browsers

51
00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:28.766
do. unfortunately not on mobile. but a lot of modern

52
00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:32.766
browsers on the desktop will. And it allows you to run these games

53
00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:36.766
just by going to a webpage. without having to install the Unity Player plugin.

54
00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:40.766
which can be a barrier for a lot of people who might want to try out your game.

55
00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:44.766
So. this will allow you to share the game with your friends and family.

56
00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:48.766
very very easily. just by uploading it to Game

57
00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:52.766
Bucket and sharing on social media. and they won't have to install any plugins

58
00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:56.766
in order to play your game. And you'll be able to show them

59
00:03:56.766 --> 00:04:00.766
all the cool work you've been doing in this course!

60
00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:04.766
As you can see. we're currently at the compiling

61
00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:08.766
native code to JS. that means JavaScript.

62
00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:12.766
and this is the last stage of the process. After

63
00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:16.766
this is finished. you'll end up with a folder that we can zip and

64
00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:19.666
upload to Game Bucket. So. once again it's

65
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.666
challenge time! We have a

66
00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:27.666
challenge here to share your Web GL build with your

67
00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:31.666
friends. So to do this. you're going to have to first check your game very

68
00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:35.666
thoroughly. to make sure that the Number Wizard is working in exactly the same way you

69
00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:39.666
want it to. Then. I'd like you to make a Web GL

70
00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:43.666
build. just as I've showed you in this video with these instructions. And

71
00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:47.666
finally. share this on Game Bucket and social

72
00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:51.666
media. and I'm going to show you this after the break OK. So pause the video and have

73
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:55.666
a go!

74
00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:59.666
OK. welcome back! Let's dive right back in and show you

75
00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:02.766
how to share this on Game Bucket. if you have forgotten. a quick revision.

76
00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:06.766
So. before the break I had left the build running. and now you can see that

77
00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:10.766
this folder has popped up. my build folder containing my build.

78
00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:14.766
So. all you have to do to upload this to Game Bucket is simply right-

79
00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:18.766
click on this and compress it. On Windows it's a slightly different proceturre. but

80
00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:22.766
what you want to do is create a .zip of this folder. And then.

81
00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:26.766
we simply go over into our favorite web browser

82
00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:30.766
and get our gamebucket.io opened.

83
00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:34.766
and then. we simply want to upload. We can see

84
00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:38.766
these are the simple instructions. We can upload. And we

85
00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:42.766
will find the code that we're looking for.

86
00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:46.766
[Sings] Da da da. da da da da da! That's my finding the code music!

87
00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:50.766
And we select the .zip and hit open. It couldn't be

88
00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:54.766
any more simple than that. We wait for that to upload and do the various

89
00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:58.766
processing that needs to happen. and boom. you get a URL and a

90
00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:02.766
page that looks exactly like this. and it will load.

91
00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:06.766
if maybe a little bit slowly at first. It'll load into your game.

92
00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:10.766
which you should be able to play in a web browser. There we go!

93
00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:14.766
We have Number Wizard. and we can click Start. we can do Higher or Lower. etc.

94
00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:18.766
And it all works as it does in your editor. but the difference

95
00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:22.766
is this is happening without a plugin. You can tell because I'm in Chrome and Chrome doesn't have a

96
00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:26.766
Unity Player plugin. Perfect! We'll see you

97
00:06:26.766 --> 00:06:29.433
in the next video!
