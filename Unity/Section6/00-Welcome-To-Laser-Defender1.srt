00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,740
So hi, and welcome to laser defender. Laser defender is a brilliant new game.

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,640
Ben, what was laser defender all about?

00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,360
So laser defender is a classic old space shooter. You are at the bottom of the screen.

00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,900
The bad guys come in and try and shoot you from above.

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,280
It’s a great great game. It flows really nicely, and there’s a load of new things you are going to learn in there.

00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,840
So, Brice, what are the three or four major new things they’re going to pick up?

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,340
Yes, some really exciting things actually.  It’s the first time you are going to meet the animation framework.

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,560
So Unity’s got this really powerful behind the scene animation framework, that you can do lots of cool stuff with,

00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,800
and it’s the first time we are going to be playing around with it.

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,160
To firstly move stuff about, move stuff around, and things like add effects as well.

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,780
So that’s going to be quite interesting.

00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,200
In addition to that, we’ll be meeting trigger colliders for the first time,

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,540
and we’ve been doing a lot of non-trigger colliders.

00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,240
Just normal colliders before, but now we’ve got a different type of collider.

00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,700
And they give you a little bit more power to do certain things in the code, rather than let the engine resolve it.

00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
And thirdly and lastly, we’re going to be using particle effects, a little bit more,

00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,840
to do some cool stuff with the backgrounds of our game,

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,380
and to make it feel more alive and to give some depth in a 2D setting.

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,160
And of course again, we want you to create your own variations on this, from the start.

00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,600
Even as you’re going through the videos, you don’t have to use the assets Brice is using:

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,000
sound, bit graphics, animations, any of it.

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,720
You can change it for yourself, either at the end, or I suggest as you go through.

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,800
So enjoy the section, it’s going to be fun!

00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,820
You’re going to have a great game and a load of new tools at the end. And We’ll see you soon. Bye.
