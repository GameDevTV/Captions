00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,580
So, hi, and welcome back! In this video,
we're going to be animating the position

00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,389
of incoming enemies. Really, we've got a
game, right now, and the enemies

00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:19,340
kind of just pop into existence, which is really not what we want. So, instead of that,

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,850
we're going to be using the animation
for the first time and getting our

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,470
enemies to animate and to fly in
menacingly and attack the players.

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,960
So, how about we get started. Let's get
going!

00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,059
Where would we start? We've never
seen animation before, so this is the

00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:41,690
first time we've done animations. Where would we get started? Well, the first thing we

00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,840
need to do, we're going to animate the
enemies, so we need an enemy. Right now,

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,940
we have no enemy in our scene. Remember,  they're being generated at runtime, so the

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,149
first thing we want to do, is grab an Enemy
Prefab and drop him in our scene. So, let's

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,910
zoom in and see this guy here, and right now, we can see in the Enemy Prefab, we've got

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,170
the script for the behavior, we've got a
Collider RigidBody, etc. What we don't

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,250
have is anything to do with animation. And
so, how am I going to create an animation

00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,369
on my enemy? Well, I'm going to open up a
brand new pane, which was never seen

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:21,950
before, so I'm right clicking on my pane. Here we go, add a tab, and I'm adding the animation

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,080
tab. So, this is the tab we've not seen before. It looks a little bit complicated at first, but we

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,869
don't have to worry, too, much about that.
We select our enemy and you'll

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,930
see immediately the tab changes, and when we've got nothing selected, whereas when we

00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,680
just selected our enemy the tab changes. Then, we go here, and we're going to create a new

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,820
clip. What does that mean? It pops up with a save window. Well, we're creating an

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,000
animation here; this is the Animation
Tool that lets you create and build

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,320
animations. So, right now, we're creating
a new animation for the enemy, and because we're

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,250
in the context of the enemy already,
because what we've done with the

00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:06,500
folders, we're in the Enemy Folder already. And we're going to save this as Arrival Animation.

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,479
This is the animation where the enemy
swoops in, menacingly, against the player,

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,279
and so, that's what we've got. Now, what actually has happened here?

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,600
Let's take a little bit of a look
around, and see what's going on. So, we've

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,250
got this enemy selected. Let's take a
look at the Inspector. We can see at the

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,040
bottom of the Inspector, something new
has been added here. We've got an animator

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,240
being added, and we have a controller
being added here, the Enemy Controller.

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,960
So, if we take a look at the project, in the Enemy Folder, alongside the Arrival Animation,

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,970
which we just created, we also have an
Enemy Controller here. And if we select it, we

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,709
now have this animation, Animator Window, pop up. This is a brand new

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,450
window, we've not seen it before, so right now, we're not worried too much about that,

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,350
but a bunch of stuff has been going on
in the background, that Unity has put in

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,660
place for us to do animations. So, really we're only going to concentrate on

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,300
the one animation for now, and then, we'll try it. But really remember that Unity, when you've

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,220
created animation on an enemy, has
actually done a whole bunch of work in

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,630
the background for you, specifically to
create things like the Animator, the

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,450
Animator Controller, as well as the
animation itself. But we don't worry

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,720
about that just for now, we'll return to
it very soon. So, how about the animation?

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,870
Let's get our enemy selected and let's
take a look at the animation we've got.

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,030
So, we selected the Arrival Animation, which we've just created, and

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,850
here the animator has not been put on
the prefab. Remember, our enemies are all

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,310
built from prefab, and we haven't got
this applied. And how can I tell? I can

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,540
tell, because this is bold. Bold in the
Inspector, means it hasn't been applied

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,450
to the prefab. So, what am I going to do?
Well, firstly, I'm going to reset this position

00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,540
to 000, right. Let me reset my position

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:07,500
to 000, so that I don't have to change my prefab. And then, I'm going to apply to my prefab, and

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,269
now, you can see this has stopped being bold. All the animator and the Animator

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,040
Controller and all the animation stuff has stopped being bold, because it's now applied to the prefab.

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,140
So, what do I do now? Well,  I'm going to grab my enemy unit, and I'm

00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,190
going to add him to one of the positions of
the formation. That's because I want to

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:32,740
animate relative to the actual... I want to
animate relative to the final position,

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,640
not just an arbitrary position, so it's 000.
So, let's get started with the actual

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,280
animation. So, I click on my animation
pane, and what do I get? What does

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,790
this all mean? Well, this is a dope sheet,
and what this means is it's a timeline.

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,820
Let's actually see what this means in context. Right, what we can do is say, I want to

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,780
animate. Well, what do we want to animate? Let's think about this for a minute.

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,180
I want this guy to swoop in from outside
of the play space. What this means is,

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,300
I want him to change the position, so I'm going to click Add Curve, go to Transform, and select position.

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,520
Click the + button to add the position. So, now we've got some new things coming up

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:18,880
inside the Animation Pane, and you'll
notice if you're very careful, eagle-eyed,

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,830
that you have... this button has just gone
selected, this Record Button, as well as

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,820
the Play, Pause, and Step Button have actually turned red.

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,020
What this means is, we are now in
Animation Record Mode. Whatever we do to

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,080
the object in the scene now changes that
object's position or

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,470
rotational etc. the attributes of that object, for that particular animation

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,060
position in the time series, in the time
frame, right. This key frame here, a 0, is the

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,000
position of the enemy, and after 1
second, the enemy will be at this position

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,380
here. So, now we have two different positions at two different

00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,750
points in time, and we'll change between
the two. So, what does that look like?

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,920
Well, if I press play absolutely nothing happens, because right now if I inspect this... Let me stop the

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,830
play. And you'll notice that the red bar
shows you at what point you're looking at

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:17,160
the variable for, so if I look at the positions,
it's all 000, right. And if I click on the

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,230
Start, it's all 0. If I click on the end, it's all 0. Ok fine, Brice, that's not very helpful!

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:29,600
How about I start at a different
position, I start at X is 2. You can see that has

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,500
just jumped in the frame itself, right. You can see that has just jumped in the scene. It has just jumped by

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,730
2, in the X direction. What happens if I press play, now?

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,960
Well, let's try it. You can see it. It's slowly
moving into position, and so all the work

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,810
of... and you'll notice also the
position itself has turned red in the

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,990
Inspector. That's to show us we're currently animating it, and it's being controlled by the

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,750
animation, not by us. So, let's pause that,
and we can see that in the middle...

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,400
Let's pick an arbitrary point. You'll see that the X position is not 2 and it's not 0.

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,400
That's because Unity has done all the
hard work for us. We've given it two

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,420
keyframes and we've said at time 0, the position is 2; at time 1, the position is 0,

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,380
sort the rest out for me. But we can do more stuff with it, and this is just

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,320
exactly what we're going to do. So, what
do I mean by swooping in? Well, let's zoom out

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,950
a little bit. Not quite like that. Let's zoom out a little bit. And I actually want to

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:37,360
start here, and instead of changing the
position in the Animation Pane itself, I'm actually going

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,560
to change it in the scene view by hand. And you'll notice that,  because I'm in Animation Record Mode,

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,510
when I change this, this will actually change the position in the animation. It will

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,230
not change the position of the object,
when I'm out of Animation Record. Let me

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,310
show you what I mean. I stop the
recording mode, my object immediately jumps back.

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,340
I press recording mode, my object jumps to the beginning of the animation, so what do I actually want

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:08,460
to show as an animation? Well, I want them to swoop in, from the top left-hand side,

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,940
into their position. So, right now, if I press play, what does it look like? Well, it's just

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,550
linearly coming in, that's not quite very
satisfying. So, I'm actually going to change the

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,560
position a little bit. I'm going to add a keyframe. So, I'm going to select a time, and I'm going to

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,940
select a time, about three quarters of the way there. Then, I'm going to move my ship, below its actual

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,980
accepted final destination position. So, what does the animation look like, now? Let's try it.

00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:44,039
I kind of like that swooping effect. So, it comes in... in front of its intended position. Then, it

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,490
slows down and pops back, going backwards into its actual position in the formation.

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,300
I really like that effect, but it's
missing something. I don't quite like...

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,790
Let's zoom in, and we can see it in the game scene. I think... yeah here we go. It's missing something.

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,829
It doesn't feel quite alive, it feels like it's just moving

00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:05,300
arbitrarily. What I actually want is to
add some rotation, so to do that, I'm

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,079
going to stop my animation from playing. I'm going to select the beginning keyframe.

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,360
The beginning keyframe is fine, I don't care, but this keyframe here, I'm going to rotate it

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,820
a little bit. So, I'm going to grab the rotation tool; I'm going to rotate it a little bit.

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,500
So now, it's actually coming forward. It'll have a rotation when it's coming down, and

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,259
it'll change its rotation back, so that when
you're towards the end, it should have a

00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:35,100
rotation of 0. Let's take a look at that, now. At this point here, it has a

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,660
keyframe here and here. We're going to
change the rotation and put 0 here.

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,079
So, that's the final state. This is the intermediate state, about three-quarters of the way

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:49,350
through the animation, and this is the
beginning state, which is out of the

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,949
scene view right now, up here. So, what happens if I press play, now?

00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:59,459
Let's take a look at it, in the game view.
So, it's coming in and it's rotating

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,220
nicely, and all the interpolation is done
by Unity itself. We don't have to do any

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,860
of the hard work. So now, it's your turn!

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,240
Now, it's your turn to mess around with the

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,309
the animation. I want you to create a little animation. It could be like mine, or you

00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,959
could have it sweeping from the side or
coming from the top, up to you. Just animate

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,899
the enemy in a way that looks good, that feels like the enemy is coming in for the fight,

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,369
is getting prepared and ready to engage
your player. And remember, play around

00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:33,369
with the Animation Tool. It's now your turn
to really play around with this. Right

00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:36,889
now, I've only shown what you can
do by animating the transform, but

00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:40,490
actually animations are a lot more
sophisticated than that. You can actually do

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,579
anything you can think of, really. Anything that can be changed in the Inspector,

00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,540
can also be changed in the Animator. The
Animator can change any attribute within

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,309
the inspector, including things to do
with the Animator itself. So, what's

00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:58,230
really interesting is that you can have
the animation animate values into your

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,429
script, which is always really useful. You
can do some really cool stuff with that,

00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:07,189
by saying the size of an object given
its distance or anything else like that.

00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:12,999
So, play around with this. This is now your
time to play around, and try out what you

00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:17,629
can do with the animation. As a little
hint, as well as doing the rotation and

00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:22,049
position, why don't you try and animate
the scale, so that it looks smaller when

00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:26,009
it's further away. And then, animate in so that it's swooping into position,

00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,820
coming closer to the player, so there's a really guttural feel. And don't forget,

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,140
when you're done with your animation to press pause, to stop recording. And

00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:38,029
now, any changes you make will not
affect the animation, but will actually

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:44,349
affect the position of your object in
the game. So, go ahead! Give it a shot!

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:52,510
Play around with the animation! This is your time to go nuts and explore what the animation package can do.

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:57,340
So, how did it go? Did you manage to get your animation looking interesting? Did you manage to get something cool

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,910
going on? I'm going to go with the animation I originally had,

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,830
you know, and I've got this animation here.
And now, it's time to say when should we

00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:13,590
play the animation? So, what happens if I
play the game, now? Something weird is going on here.

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:20,300
They're definitely animating in, and they're
animating in, relative to their position,

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,100
but they keep looping. Not only are they
keeping looping, but also only two of

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,240
them are coming down. So, why only two of them. That's a really interesting question.

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,320
So, let's first stop the looping, and then,
we figure out why two of them only, are

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,450
coming down. So, let's put a stop... And the
looping... If we go and select our... Oh, I forgot

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,100
to remove my enemy from the game,
actually. If you've got this enemy here, it lets

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,460
me remove him from the game. That's just
the enemy I used to build the

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:50,990
animation. I don't need him anymore, actually, I can remove him. So now, I said I want to select

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,970
my enemy prefab, and the enemy prefab should still have all the animator, because we applied

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,160
those to the prefab, remember? And if I click on the animator for the prefab, I

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,360
can see this arrival state. This is the arrival
animation. So Ok, the Arrival Animation is

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,240
going on. So, let me pull this guy out. Let me start the game. Let me pause it and

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,320
select one of the enemy objects. And you'll be able to see what the animation does,

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:24,970
in the Animator Pane, so let me keep playing that game, right. Can you see how it's simply looping over

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,890
the Arrival Animation? So, it's arriving once, and then, it keeps arriving and arriving and arriving and arriving. Not

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,140
very useful, that really. So, what we want
is to stop the game, come back into our

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,290
Animator, and what we want to do is create another state. We've got this in an arrival

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,140
state and we're going to create a second
state. This is just going to be an

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,330
empty state, and instead of calling him new state, I'm going to call him Idle. That

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,380
just means the enemy is, instead of being
animating in, the enemy is in the

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,690
formation doing its stuff, it's not doing anything else. So right now, nothing else will happen,

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,200
right, and you can tell Idle is different
from Arrival. You can see how Arrival

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,600
is orange and Idle is gray, that's because Arrival is a default animation.

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,279
Because we only had one, that was a
default animation, but you can change the

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,139
default animation. Let me do that now, to
change it to the Idle Animation and see

00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,519
what happens. So, I can right click on Idle and go Set as Default, and

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,970
you can see that Idle now turns orange. If
I press the game, what happens? They just

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,410
pop in, and they're a bit dispersed. We'll
see about that in just a second.

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:34,870
But for now, let's go back to the Animator, and turn Arrival in as the default transition...

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,870
the default state. That's the right one. So, Arrival is when we arrive.

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:47,380
As soon as the enemy is created, it should
start in the Arrival and then arrive, and then, it should go into idle.

00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:52,600
And to do that, to tell Unity to do that,
we're going to right click on Arrival, and

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,009
click Make Transition. And this gives
us an arrow, and we're going to attach this

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,480
arrow, by clicking on Idle. And now,
when you press play, they arrive, and then, they

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,480
go into formation. So now, we have two
new issues, right. We have the issues of,

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,540
were missing a lot of our enemies, and
secondly, we are also in the wrong

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,689
position. So, let's first fix the enemies
and then fix the position. So, we go for the

00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,560
enemies. We'll have a look at the scene.

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,050
What's causing only two enemies to come
down? Well, if we think about what we're

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,630
doing here, it'll be pretty obvious
that when we play the game... And let me

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:36,100
pause it and go into the Scene View. I'm going to select the top Shredder, and I'm

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,759
going to carry on playing the game. Let's go
back to the scene, and I have the feeling

00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,130
that they're being created just
underneath the Shredder and then,

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,060
shredded out of existence. So, I'm just
going to stop the game and move my shredder

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,540
upwards, because if they hit the shredder,
they'll immediately be destroyed, won't they.

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,579
So, let me click the shredder and move him
out of the way. So, I'm moving the shredder up a

00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:04,779
little bit. Here we go, and if I press play,
again, they are indeed all coming at once.

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,649
So, why are they dispersed? We've solved the problems of them all disappearing. That

00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,640
was just because they hit the Shredder and
got destroyed. Well, let's inspect the actual

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,670
enemies to see why they are dispersed.
Press pause, rather than

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:25,100
stop, and let's take a look at our
enemies. As you know, the enemy position is

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,050
-2, -1, and 0, when they are in
their Idle state. That's no good, that's

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:36,000
really not what we want. Why are they in that state? That's not really what we want. And the

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,930
reason for that is something is going
wrong with how the animation perceives

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,670
its position, and it's giving, if we have
a look,

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,040
0 0 is in the middle compared to the
formation. And really it's putting them

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:55,890
relative to the 0 0, and then, adding
that on top of their position from their

00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:03,590
position object. So really, something is
off here in our animation, and really the

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,880
animation to blame isn't the Arrival
Animation. At the end of Arrival, they are

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,699
at the right place. So, which animation is to blame? Well, it's this. If we take a look at our Animator,

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,280
in the Idle Animation we can see there's no
animation whatsoever, there's no motion.

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,990
There's no animation being played in Idle, so by default it'll have a relative position,

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,560
rather it'll do the wrong thing with the relative positioning. So, what we

00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,440
need to do is actually create... so we stop
the game. We drag in another enemy,

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,500
not into our Animator, but rather into our scene. And I'm going to create a new animation, to this guy.

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,240
So, I've got the Arrival, I'm going to create
a new animation clip, I'm going to call this

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:51,070
the Idle clip, and I'm going to add a curve for the transform position. And I'm going to

00:17:51,070 --> 00:18:00,460
start at the 0 point, for 0 0, and I'm going to delete the second animation, the keyframe. Delete key, so

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,070
it's always 0 0, there's very little
animation to do, whatsoever. So, I've got this

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,750
saved. I can stop recording now, and if I
jump back into my Animator for my...

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,010
We've got the Idle 0 created automatically.
So, let me remove the old one, Delete, and

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,990
it'll prompt us for deletion.

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,720
Idle 0 and then, I can redo what I did before, which was to make a transition between my Arrival and

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,020
my Idle state. So, let's take a look, now. We've got the idle state with an Idle

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:35,910
position and see what goes on. Brilliant! Now, this little dude in the middle, [Laughs]

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,100
that's the dude that was there when I tried to do the animation, and I just forgot to

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:49,000
delete him. Stop the game, grab the enemy, and delete the dude. And then, we play the game again, and

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,600
all of the enemies now animate, as we want them to. They're quite a tough bunch.

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,460
I've got to say, they're not easy to kill, and they're shooting a lot and they're not easy to kill.

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,620
So, what I want to see is what happens
when I delete, or rather when I destroy,

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:09,870
all of them, and we should see that they are arriving one after the other. And

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:15,679
the effect is quite good.  I quite like
that effect of multiple enemies, coming in one after the other.

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,279
Now, it's your turn, when this video stops, to have a look at the animation,

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,320
and make it your own. Instead of having it coming in from the top left,

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,740
make it come from the top right. Make it come from the side. Make it come from the top, directly.

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,210
Have it, maybe twist around, play around
with the scaling factor, as I mentioned

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,520
earlier, and also see if you can try and
get it to animate and change the sprite.

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,380
Let's see some thruster on that sprite.
I'll definitely be going through a lot more

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,559
about animation in other videos, but for
now, we've got our first introduction.

00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,030
Let's see where we can take it. I'll see
you later, in another video! Bye for now.

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,309
Have fun while you're at it!
