00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920
Are you ready for this! In this video we're
going to be talking about sprite

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.670
rendering order! Oh. my goodness. that sounds exciting! I am so excited. how about you?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.170
Are you psyched about sprite rendering
order? Let's get started! What does that

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.130
mean? Well. let me show you the problem
first. and then. we'll talk about the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.279
solution. So first. let's play our game.
And if you're very careful you'll

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.250
see that the lasers I'm shooting and the lasers the enemy is shooting are

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.710
first rendered above the enemy and
player sprites. That means the laser seems

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.550
to appear directly on top of the enemy
ship. which seems a bit weird really. and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.940
we want to change that and we want to
change that in a nice effective way. So

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.370
how are we going to do that? Let's stop the game. How are we going to change the

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.579
renderings. so that the lasers get rendered below the enemy ships?

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.289
Well. what we're going to do is we're going to change the sprite rendering order. and

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.410
to do that. we're going to be using
sorting layers. And sorting layers are a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.060
tool that we can use to tell the camera
which layer to render first. and the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.189
camera will ignore the Z depth and will go
by sorting layer first. So. even if

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.759
an item that is in a given layer is closer to the camera in the Z dimension.

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.150
it'll still be rendered below. if the
layer is second after the one

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.600
we're rendering. So it's takes priority...
the sorting layers take priority

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.820
over the Z depth. and that's what we're
going to be using to make sure

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.270
everything is rendered at the right
layer. So note that the sorting layers

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.340
are different from the layers we use for
collisions. We already talked about

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.079
collision layers to stop. say the enemy
laser colliding with enemies.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.909
These layers are a different type of layer. So now. we've explored two types

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.579
of layers. the sorting layers and the
physics layers. and they both have a very

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.799
different purpose. So. let's get started.
Let's get started. The first thing I'm going to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.990
do is I'm going to jump into my game. I'm
going to go to my Edit Menu. go to my Project

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.220
Settings. and go to Tags and Layers.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.430
and I'm going to close the Layers drop
down and I'm going to open the Sorting layers drop down.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.190
And right now. we have no layers here. We
have no sorting layers. so I'm

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.910
going to add several sorting layers. and I'll
talk you through what each does and why

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.300
we're using it. So the first sorting layer I want. and I click on the + button to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.090
create a new one. so that the first
sorting later I want is the lowest one.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:48.080
That would be the enemy lasers. so Enemy Projectiles. That's my lower layer; the layer above

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.600
that will be my enemies themselves. and I might have those the wrong way around but that's ok.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.900
because we can always. once you've created the layers. you can always drag and drop them

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.920
around with the mouse. So if we've got this the wrong way around. we can just swap them

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.810
around like that. And thirdly. I'm going to
have another layer. which is going to be my

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:17.470
Player Projectiles layer. and finally. lastly.
the top layer the top dog. the one that's

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.680
going to be rendered last. so it's going to be on top of everything is my player ship.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.430
So I'm going to call that player. So now. we've got four for sorting layers. as well as a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.430
default. So right now. it won't do much.
but if we check our enemy and we have

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.850
the enemy prefab here. we selected the enemy prefab. and you'll notice that the layer

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.650
is Enemies. That's our physics layer in the
inspector. the first one you see. however

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.380
you'll go to the Sprite Renderer. and the
Sprite Renderer will have a Sorting Layer

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.130
drop down. And now here. we can choose
to make our enemies appear in the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.769
Enemies Layer. and then. if we do the same for the Enemy Laser. instead of having the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.930
default layer. we'll make them be in Enemy Projectiles. So let's see whether that's

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.260
made any difference. whatsoever. to our
game whether we've got the projectiles the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.540
right way around. Let's press play and see
whether they fire. And I don't know

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.709
whether you can notice it. but now the
projectiles are no longer being spawned

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.620
on top of... at least they don't appear to be
spawned on top of the enemy ships. but

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.980
they appear to be coming from underneath.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.170
which is exactly the behavior we
wanted. So awesome! Basically. that is the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:35.790
sorting layers.  Not much to it.  but a really useful trick to let you make sure that the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.800
sprites are ordered. in the right way. and
that you have the right things on

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.450
top of each other. So your job is next
and that is to make sure that

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.030
the Player Laser is always drawn below
the ship. and in addition. make sure the

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.490
Player Laser is always drawn above the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.680
enemies' prefabs. So that's your
job.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.470
Make sure that the three layers work well for the different things. So good luck. and I

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:20.210
will see you very shortly. So how did it
go? Did you manage to get the sorting

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.370
layers doing the things that you wanted
them to. The last thing we really needed to

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.910
do was to go into our game and go grab our Player and make sure that the Player Sprite

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.970
Renderer is in the Player Layer and make
sure that the Player Laser Sprite Renderer

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.480
is in the Player Projectiles Layer. And then... we're going to add actually... we're going to

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.630
go back to our layers. and I'm going to add a final layer to all of them. So if I go back

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.280
to my Project Settings. go to my Tags and Layers. and then. go to my Sorting

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.230
Layers. in my Sorting Layers. I'm going to add a final layer. and that's going to be the

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.100
Explosions Layer. And the reason I'm doing the explosion is. anytime there's an

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.050
explosion. that should come on top of
everything. That's kind of like an

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.290
aftereffect. special effect. and that's
going to be my Explosion Layer. So awesome! We

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.800
now. have a bunch of layers. that we can
make sure that all the explosion... all

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.590
the effect... all the sprites are rendered
exactly the way we want them to. and we

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.480
can test that out in the game.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.890
So if I... and look at where the shots are fired. They're firing it from underneath the enemy

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:43.100
ship. and they're fired from underneath the player's ship. Exactly what we wanted! Cool stuff! Now. that's just

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.900
another tool for your toolbox. Sorting
layers. letting you decide which order

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.260
sprites are rendered in. without resorting
to Z depth. So I hope you enjoyed it. Hope

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.160
you like this short video about sorting
layers.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.530
that's what we talk about. when we talk
about them. See you in another video! Bye.
