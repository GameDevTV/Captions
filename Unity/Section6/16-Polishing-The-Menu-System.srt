00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,889
Hello, and welcome back! In this video,
we're going to be polishing our menu

00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:13,759
system. So, right now, we've got our Laser
Defender 2D space shooter; the problem is

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,330
it's sandwiched between two menu systems... menu scenes. Both the Start

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,369
Menu and the End Menu are from a different games, so they've got completely

00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:26,900
the wrong style, and in addition they
just feel wrong for that game. They've got the wrong

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,640
front, they've got the wrong color, and
even the text is wrong, it's referring to

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,120
a different game. And as well as that, we
are not currently passing the score

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,930
that we accumulate, in the game itself.
When we're beating the game,

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,230
we're not passing that score into our End Scene, so we can't tell the player, after he has died: Hey,

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:51,270
dude, you have now earned that many points. So, that's what we're

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,289
going to do. Those are the two things we're going to do. We're going to change the style, and we're

00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:59,420
going to pass the score to the End
Scene. So, let's remind ourselves exactly

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:06,500
what we have, in our game. This is our
game screen our Game Scene. This is

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,060
our Start Menu, which we imported from
Block Breaker. This is our Win Screen,

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,170
which we imported from Block Breaker again. So, what we're going to do, now, and

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:20,460
in fact, what you're going to do now is, I
want you to change all the styles for

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,799
the two menus, for the Start Menu and the End Menu. So, that's your job, now! So, I want

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,560
you to pause the video, once I'm done
talking, and change all the menus, so that

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,360
they look like Laser Defender menus. So,
you know how to do all that and good

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:45,320
luck, and I will see you very shortly to
show you how I'm doing it. See you soon.

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,030
So, here we go, here is how I'm going to change the Menu System, so it looks like Laser

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,040
Defender. So, I'm going to jump back, and I'm going to start with my Start Menu. I'm going to, firstly,

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,010
change all the text. So, I've got the title, it's no longer Block Breaker, it's Laser

00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:12,959
Defender. Not defeender but defender. And my "Smash all the blocks to win" my subtitle is going

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:22,959
to be "Defend the Earth from an Alien
Invasion". So, "Defend the Earth from an

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,770
Alien Invasion". And you'll notice that the text is, too, long for our text box. So, I'm

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,540
going to change the Vertical Overflow,
and I'm going to just change it to Overflow, so

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,200
everything shows up. And next, I'm going to
change all the fonts. I think the

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,420
fonts just aren't suitable for this game.
So, I'm going to pick a bunch of fonts that

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,280
I think look good, and in fact I'm picking  the front that I used for the

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,459
score inside the game scene itself. So,
I'm just changing all the fonts here,

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,870
nothing particularly fancy you've done all
this before.

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,030
Feel free to use a different font. Feel
free to use multiple different fonts. You

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,959
know now how to get new fonts and where 
to get them from, so, don't hesitate to be

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,329
creative with your fonts. So, I've got this thing here, let me go and then, change

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:16,480
the subtitle. I want that to be a little bit
darker, because I think it's too bright.

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,750
It takes away from the title,
and the title, I think yellow is not

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,299
quite the color for this game,

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,549
so I'm going to change it. And I've got a
bunch of preset blues here; I'm going to

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:32,320
change it to a nice blue. And finally, the
buttons, when you move your mouse over

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,540
them, they get to their highlight color,
and right now, their highlight color is

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,230
green. I don't think that's great for
this game either, so I'm going to pick

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,650
a nice light blue. So, here we go! And what
does that menu look like, now?

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:55,150
If I press play, we can see the menu
looks a lot more like Laser Defender.

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:03,510
So, cool! We, also, have the music, and we'll worry about that in a little bit. So, now we've got the start menu

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,319
working. Does it take us to the right
scene? Yes, it does, everything is working as we want it to.

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,420
So, now, let's jump! Let's save our scene, Command S or Control S, and let's take care of

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,799
the Win Screen. Now, the Win Screen is going to be a little bit different.

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:24,979
Firstly, it's no longer a Start Menu, it's an End Menu. Here we go, and let

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:33,440
me capitalize that. Cool! So, I've got the End Menu here, and I've got the Title and the Play

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,570
Again Button. I actually want to show the score here, so I'm going to move myself...

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,150
I'm going to change my mode, my view mode, in the scene to be the UI Mode, UI Editing Mode,

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,509
and I'm going to move my buttons around, so I can leave some space, so that we can

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:52,720
then, add a couple of buttons in the
middle, to do things like well, not a button

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
rather, but some texts in the middle to
show the player's score. So, let's start by

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:05,600
changing all the fonts. I think that's where we should start! Let's select fronts that match the Start Menu.

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,080
That looks better. Let's change the color of the title, so that it's a more Laser Defender color. You

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,340
really can't tell in the scene view, so
I'm going to take a look at it in the game view

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,030
instead. That looks better. And now, I'm going to duplicate the title, and instead of

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,140
calling it title, I'm going to call it label.

00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,100
That's going to be my label for my score, and the label for the score is

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,630
going to have a different text. It's
going to be a different color. So, I'm going to

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,330
change it to a much lighter blue, so it looks different, and I'm going to change this

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,349
position, as well. I'm going to make it
smaller, and I'm going to put it

00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:49,270
a little bit to the left. I'm also going to change the text alignment,

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,180
so it's right align text, and then, I'm
going to duplicate it and put

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,009
a placeholder for my score. I haven't quite
duplicated it, so I'm dragging the original.

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:08,769
Let me duplicate it, and let me move this
one to the other side. Here we go, that looks about right.

00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,900
And then, I'm going to left align that, and that's going to be the score itself and I'm just going to

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:17,009
put some place holder numbers in there. Here we go. So, cool! And then, this is no

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,869
longer the label, that is the actual
score. So cool! So, now, if I play

00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:26,320
this scene, what does it look
like? Well, it looks alright.

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,659
You can do better. I know you can
do better. I know you can spend more time on it

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:33,659
and make it look even more awesome,
but really we still have this green

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,240
highlight, so let's change that. And once
we've changed the green highlight we're

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,370
really done with this menu system, for now anyway. So, I've changed the

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,460
green highlight. All good to go.

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,169
So, that's done for the styling changes. Right, we've done all the changes

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,999
for styling, so what's next?

00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:58,509
Well, next up is passing the score to
the Final Scene. So, what are we going to

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:04,199
do to pass the score to the Final Scene? If you remember, we have a scorekeeper in the

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,459
Game Scene that keeps track of the
score, and we want to show it in the

00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:14,699
Final Scene. And so, what we're going to
do to do that is, we're going to grab the...

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,990
change the score, so that the score is kept in a static variable. So,

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,259
the static variable means that it's kept
in the class and not the object, so we're

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,399
not going to keep it in the scorekeeper
we create, but instead we're going to keep it

00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,509
in the template for scorekeeper objects. And then, we're going to use that score

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:37,919
to display, in the Final Scene with the
addition of a new script, and as

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,979
soon as we display it, we're going to reset it
to zero, so that the next game we play

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:47,120
we start from the score of 0 again. So, let's do that, now. We're going to start in our Game Scene, in

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,169
actually what is the player in the
Game Scene. So, let's jump into the Game

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,830
Scene, save the changes we made to the Final Scene, and in the Game Scene, we're going to

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:04,009
grab the player, and in the PlayerController script... [Sings do do do do do do do]

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,470
The first thing I want to do is, whenever we die we should jump to the End Scene.

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:15,450
So, let's jump back. And we have a Die
function and then, we have in the Die

00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,640
function we just simply destroy the object,
but now, we want to do something else,

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,250
which is jump to the scene. How are we going to do that? Well, we're going to use our Level

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,600
Manager. We've got a Level Manager script that let's us load new levels easily. So, we're going

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,510
to jump back into our game,

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,190
grab one of the prefabs we created in a previous game, call the Level Manager, and

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:40,580
from the PlayerController we're going to
call our Level Manager. So, let's do that, now.

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:53,190
So, I'm dying. I want to find the Level
Manager, and I can do it using the Find

00:08:53,190 --> 00:09:00,000
function. And once I've found the Level Manager object, I need to get the component from

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,020
inside the Level Manager Object, which is
the Level Manager component. So use

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,500
the GetComponent method, and I can use
the type to select exactly which component

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:16,270
I want, and here we are. So, now I've got the Level Manager Object. What I actually want to do is

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:23,260
load a new level. So, let me turn that into
a Level Manager Object, so LevelManager

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:32,120
man, is this thing here, and then I can just do man.LoadLevel(). And I'm going to pass

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,589
in a component, the level I want, which is
going to be the Win Screen. Cool! So,

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,400
brilliant! That's sorted. In fact, we're
not doing much in the Level Manager that we

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,100
wouldn't be able to do by just simply
going Application.LoadLevel, but for now it's

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,360
going to have that level of indirection. So, cool! We've reused that structure. We're loading the new

00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,820
level, when we die. What's left? Well,
what's left? We're already updating the

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,330
score, so, we're already talking to the
scorekeeper, whenever one of the enemies

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,260
dies. Let's take a look at the enemies to remind ourselves. We've got a private ScoreKeeper,

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,720
and we do Find ("score").GetComponent&lt;ScoreKeeper&gt;(); and then, we add

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,850
scores to them. So, let's take a look at
the score keeper. What we want to do is

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,010
pass this score integer, from the Game
Scene, to the Win Screen.

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,630
And to do that, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to change that to be a public

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,890
static int score, and that's it.

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:38,510
In addition to that, I'm going to change
the Reset method to be public static, as

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,780
well. And now, because it's a static method, it can be called without having a myText

00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,780
variable created, so I'm just going to remove that.

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,120
So, that's going to do two things. Let's take a look at what that does. Firstly, it keeps the

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,910
score in the ScoreKeeper, even when
there are no ScoreKeeper objects. Instead

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,830
of saving the score value against an
instance of something, we store it against

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,000
the template, so the template itself keeps
track of the score. That is the class that

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,360
keeps track of the score. And that let's us go back into our game, and from the,

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,070
not the Game Scene anymore, but from the Win Scene, if we jump into a scene... I do want to

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,880
save all the changes. Brilliant! Let's
take a look at the End Menu. Now, I'm going to

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,060
attach a script to my score here, let's
do that, now. Let me select the score.

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:39,010
Let's add a script to the score, and it's
a new script and I'm going to call it

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,510
ScoreDisplay. I've got the Score Display here, let's take a look at what we're going to do. So,

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,400
the Score Display... the only
responsibility of the Score Display is,

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,880
when it starts up, I want to, firstly, grab
hold of the score texts, which is going

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:05,560
to be from UnityEngine.UI. So, using UnityEngine.UI; that let's us

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:13,000
access now, and create the Text myText. And that's the text we're attached to, and we can

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,170
do that to grab hold of it, by using the GetComponent &lt;text&gt;();

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,269
And, now, we've got the text, what we can
do is grab the score from the

00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:32,450
ScoreKeeper and do myText.text. So, that's the actual field... the actual

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,329
string that's going to be displayed is
ScoreKeeper, and notice I use the capital

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:43,089
S. That's ScoreKeeper.score and it'll come up in the auto complete, and then,

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:49,240
.ToString (); And ToString will turn the score, so, this thing here is the score, the

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,019
integer score. And then, I'm going to
change it into a string, before

00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:57,970
displaying it as text. And finally, the
last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,850
ScoreKeeper, notice this is also capital, and I'm not going to destroy it or do anything like

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,519
that with it. What I am going to do is, I'm going to reset the score, and it comes up in

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:15,000
the autocomplete, because it is a static function, as well. So, one thing

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,630
that will break and then, you might
notice it is when we save this. This will be

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,160
fine, it'll set the score here to be
whatever score we've got saved and then,

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,149
delete it so that the next game we play, we start with a score

00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:35,290
of 0. What we have not quite done yet is
that, in the Game Scene... Let's jump back into our

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,250
Game Scene. When we start playing, the score will be 99999. Obviously, as soon

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,079
as we kill an enemy, the score will change,
but we don't really want to

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,180
start with a score of 99999. So, let's change that, now, and that's really easy to change.

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,269
And we just grab the score; put a zero in there. That's a nice cheap and dirty way of getting that

00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:01,019
going and very easy for us to sort out. So, what have we got left? We've got a

00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,190
little bit of tidying up to do. I'm going to
move my Score Display Script to my

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,339
Scripts; the same with the Scorekeeper Script. Here we go,

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,380
done. So, now, I've got a nice clean folder structure. So, what does that give us?

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,639
Does that give us what we were after,
which is to pass the score to the Final

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,990
Scene? Well, let's try it out. We'll
start off in our Game Scene, and we'll

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,220
press play and we'll get a score. Let me get a modest

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:36,930
score, before I get killed. And, now, it's
the trick of deliberately getting shot. Come

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:45,200
on! Come on! Come on! There we go! And then, we jump into our Win Screen, and indeed, the score does

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,080
come up on the page, which is exactly what
we were wanting. So, brilliant! And then, we

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:57,850
can play again, and we press Start and the
score does start at 0, which is exactly what we want. So,

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,210
wow! Cool! That wasn't, too, bad! That wasn't, too, bad at all!

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:08,540
We, now, have replaced the menu style, so that it makes more sense for

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:15,940
Laser Defender, and we have, as well,
passed the score we managed to get, in the

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,650
game itself, to our Win Screen. So, that is it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it, and

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,200
I will see you in the next one! Bye for
now.
