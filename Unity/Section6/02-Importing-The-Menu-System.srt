00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,020
So hi, and welcome back.

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:12,460
In this video, we’re going to be importing our menu system, to set up our Laser Defender game.

00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,020
So what are we going to do?

00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, we’re going to grab a Unity package from either A). another game,

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,720
or B). from the bundle downloads at the beginning of this section,

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,000
and we’re going to create our Laser Defender game, with a menu system.

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,320
To get started and be ready to start developing the game itself.

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,120
So how are we going to do that? Well you have a choice.

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,480
You can either grab the Unity package, the one that we’ve put in the download section,

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,080
or you can  go to one of your old games and grab the menu system from there and export as a package.

00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,480
I’m going to be showing you how to use the one from the downloads.

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,520
Feel free to do exactly the same steps, but with a package you have created yourself.

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,280
So that’s actually exactly what I want you to do now.

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:06,080
I want you to pause this video, and create a Unity package, and import it into a new project called Laser Defender.

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,380
So pause the video now, and import your package into your game, to start your menu system.

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,480
So here's how I'm going to do it.

00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,980
I’m going to open up a new Unity project;

00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,720
create a completely new project.

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,800
I’m going to set the mode to 2D.

00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,560
I’m going to choose my location,

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,780
and you can choose whatever you want and makes sense to you.

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,860
Personally I’m going to call it Laser Defender.

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,880
I have a special folder for all my Unity games,

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,180
and don’t worry about the extension on the folder name.

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,700
And here we go, we’ve got a 2D project.

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,400
I’m creating my project, and here we are.

00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,580
If you haven’t created your project as 2D, don’t worry too much about it,

00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,620
that can always be changed later, so don’t worry at all about that.

00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,140
So now I’m in my project. I can import a package by going to Assets.

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,980
Import Package. I’m going to import a Custom Package.

00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,940
And as you can see, I’ve already navigated to the right place.

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,380
This is the menu package that comes as part of the downloads,

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,540
and if I click this and double click it and select it, I can import everything.

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,920
And Unity will take time to look through all the assets and import them into its library.

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,880
And while it’s doing that. Here good brilliant!

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,300
So now I’ve got a start scene.

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,960
And if I look at the start menu as a whole, we’ve got the…

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,100
well you can probably…

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,740
if you’ve been looking at this course and other sections of this course you have probably seen this before.

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,400
So we’ve got a Start Menu. We’ve got a Win Screen.

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,220
The first thing I’m going to do actually is,

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,900
I’m going to open my Build Settings,

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,460
and I’m going to add my scenes to my Build Settings.

00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,980
I’m selecting my scenes and dragging them into the scenes in build in my Build Settings.

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:08,900
And that’s so that Unity knows that these scenes are actually going to be available while the game is playing.

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,340
So now I’ve got my scenes in. Let’s try and play the start scene and see what we get.

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,560
[Game Music Playing] So as you can tell, the background music is coming on.

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,100
I press start. I go to the end scene.

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,400
I press play again. Brilliant!

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,840
So, now the next step is to add a intermediate scene from that start scene.

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,940
To move into so I’m going to create a new scene,

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,320
and from that I’m going to save it, and I’m going to call it Game.

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,960
And that’s going to be the game scene.

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,020
My game scene is saved into Assets by default.

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,640
I'm just going to move it into my Scenes.

00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,600
My Scenes folder.

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,200
So Brilliant! I’ve got the game scene here.

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,240
Now, there’s nothing in the game scene.

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
I don’t really want anything for now,

00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,920
so I’m just going to jump into my Start Menu and make my Start Menu’s Start Button actually move me to the Game Scene.

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,120
And to do that, I go into the Inspector.

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,120
When I’ve got my Start Button selected,

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,880
I look at the buttons on the Click Handler, and I look at the Level Manager dot load level.

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,840
And instead of  loading the Win Screen, I change the Win Screen in the Inspector to the Game Scene.

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,420
And if I press play now, we should see that when I press start.

00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,200
I can’t load the scene. Why is that?

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, because I forgot to add it into my Build Settings.

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,260
So, File. Build Settings. This seems vaguely familiar.

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,940
Drag your scene into it.

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,900
I’m going to put it up here, into my Build Settings, in the second scene.

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,660
I close my Build Settings, and I try again.

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,700
So now we’ve got a Start Button that takes me to the right scene.

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,640
So great! Brilliant!

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:55,660
We are now set up and all ready to go for the next step of building this game.

00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,520
So thank you for watching, and I will see you very shortly. Bye.
