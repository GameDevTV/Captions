00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello and welcome back! In this video

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we're going to be keeping score and tracking

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
how well the player does, how well the play does in his

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Laser Defender game. So, this is pretty simple, and it's all

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
stuff you've really done before. We're going to be tracking scores

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
through a ScoreKeeper.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We're going to be attaching the score to a Text UI element

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in the scene, so that we can see what we've scored.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And we'll use the find function to grab

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the score object, and

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
get the ScoreKeeper from the EnemyController. So, pretty

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
simple stuff! So really,

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the first task we're going to do is creating the User Interface

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
for the score, and because you've got the experience for the User

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Interface, I'm going to let you do that, let you start by

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
creating a User Interface for the score. What

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
do I mean by User Interface? Well, I just want to

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
create a piece of text, inside my game

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
scene, that will keep my score with a nice

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
font. So, I'll let you pause the video

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and create your UI for the score in the scene, and

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
then together, we'll be wiring it up so that we can keep the

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
scores. See you soon!

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So, let's get started with creating our

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
UI score! We're jumping out, and

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
here I want to create a new

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
new scene. I want a new text,

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and we should see that it comes in with a Canvas and a

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
an Event System, as we expect it to. If we zoom out,

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
we can position the text where we want. So, I want it at the bottom

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
right of my scene, and

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm going to make that a little bigger. Let's pick a

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
cool font! Right now, I don't have

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
a font loaded, any descent font. I've got BMblock, but

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that's not the font I want. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
into www.dafont.com, and I'm going to use the Batman

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Forever font. I mean we've done this before, we've been to Dafont

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and we've grabbed another font before.

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And it's in my

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Finder already, so I don't have to.

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I've downloaded it in advance, it's here!

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So, let me jump into Unity,

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
find it in my Finder, and then, I can drag and drop

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the fonts into my

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Font Folder, and now, we have two Batman Forever fonts!

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Brilliant! So,

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
font that's your font material,

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
all the stuff we need for fonts! So now, I can jump back into

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
my text, change the font.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Ah, let's zoom in a little bit. I'm going to add the Batman

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Forever font, to my text.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So, I've got the text here, I drag and drop the Batman Forever into the font

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
folder, and now we have a font. I'm going to add in

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
some placeholder text, which is just going to be some numbers,

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and I'm going to change the Font Size

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
so it's nice and big. Here we go! Cool!

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That sounds about right! And

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I want to right align the text, so that it

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
grows from the right, so if I

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
have my font grow it grows in a nice way.

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm not going to have a font more than this. I think that's not going

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to be a score more than, so that's going to be a suitable

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
score. Let's keep it like that, that's good!

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We've got a Font Size, we've got the line spacing.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Let's check the color. What does it look like

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in the game space. It looks like that! Well,

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I think it's OK! Maybe make it a little bit

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
brighter,

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
something like that! Maybe a little bit of a more interesting color.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm going to go for blue! I think that's kind of the theme of

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
the game so far, so let's make it a little bit blue

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
like that. I think that looks good!

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So cool! Now, we've got the font in the game! It's time to

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
get it wired up to an actual

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
score. You know, we've got the score in the game.

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
In fact, let's rename it! Let's rename it Score!

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And then, we can find it like that!

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So cool! And now, we've got a score!

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It's your turn again actually

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
it's now your turn to create the ScoreKeeper

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Script. Now, we want a ScoreKeeper Script to keep track of the

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
score, obviously, and we've going to attach it to the score text.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We want two methods, which is Score(int point), so

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
score a number of points and reset. And the only thing it'll

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
do is add an

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
integer number of points to the score field.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You have an integer score field on your

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
ScoreKeeper. Every time you go score some points, it'll add that

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to the field, and Reset () will just set that to 0.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And then, whenever the score is changed, whenever the score method

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
is called, we also want to change the score

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
text. Now, you know how to do all that, if you've

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
been going through the course so far. So,

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
this is now your job. Your job is to create the ScoreKeeper Script, that

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
whenever we call a method Score, it changes the score

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
both internally and on the actual

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
UI object. And when ever you press Reset, it sets it to

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
0 and resets it to 0 in the UI object

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
as well. So, go for it, and I'll see you very

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
soon!

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
How did it go? How did you manage? Now, here's how I'm going

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to do it! I'm going to attach this ScoreKeeper Script

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to the Score UI, and I'm going to use

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
the GameObject.Find("Score").GetComponent&lt;Score

105
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Keeper&gt;() from my enemies

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to call the Score () method. So, let's get

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
started! Let's see what we can do about that! So, the first thing I want

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
to do is, go to my Score, and add a

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
new component. I'm going to add

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
a new script. I'm going to call it ScoreKeeper.

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And this

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
ScoreKeeper is going to be edited.

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I want a public

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
integer

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
field called score, very original.

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I don't want Start and Update methods. The only

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
methods I want are

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
going to be my void

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Score

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Points or...

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
ScorePoints

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and this will take an integer number of points,

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and this will add them to our score.

124
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Alright! And

125
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
then, once we've done that one, once we've got a score method,

126
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
we want the Reset method

127
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and that takes a new argument.

128
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
However, it simply resets the score

129
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to 0, and I'm going to set the default

130
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
value score to be 0, because that's how we should

131
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
start. So, now we've got our ScoreKeeper! That's the barebones of our

132
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
ScoreKeeper, and that's what we're going to use to build on, to

133
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
create our score keeping system.

134
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Right, so now how do we

135
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
keep the scores from the enemies? Well, the enemies

136
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
in the EnemyBehaviour, whenever we create an enemy, we're going to get

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
hold of that ScoreKeeper object,

138
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and then, call it whenever we die to

139
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
score a number of points. So, the first thing the enemy needs is

140
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in the script, a value for the score right. So, how much

141
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
is this enemy worth to my

142
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
player? So, that's going to be a public integer

143
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and scoreValue

144
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And I'm going to set it to about 100 per

145
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
enemy or maybe 150, so the number don't look so round.

146
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And then, I'm going to, in my Start function...

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So, I'm going to have to recreate my Start function.

148
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
In my Start function, I'm going to go

149
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
GameObject.Find

150
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And I'm just really showing you another way of getting hold

151
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
of something dynamically, because we are creating those guys

152
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
at runtime. We don't really have a

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
way of passing the ScoreKeeper in the

154
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Inspector, so we have to instead define it

155
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
dynamically, whenever we create our enemies.

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, it's going to be ("Score").GetComponent

157
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and this GetComponent method is used so I'm actually making

158
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
sure that I'm talking to the ScoreKeeper component.

159
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I don't want to talk to say, the transform. I want to

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
talk to the ScoreKeeper, and that will return an object of Start

161
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
of type ScoreKeeper, which is this thing here.

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
That way my enemies will immediately

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
update my ScoreKeeper. And I've forgotten to do something very important

164
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
here. We've forgotten to update the text,

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
so we'll need to be able to get the component of the text

166
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in the Start function of my ScoreKeeper, and then, update that whenever we

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
change the score. So, let's go and do that now! So, we're in

168
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Start, so let's recreate the Start method.

169
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
That takes in no arguments.

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And inside the Start method, I'm going to go

171
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
GetComponent

172
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and I want the &lt;Text&gt;

173
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
component. And you'll notice, not Texture but

174
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
&lt;Text&gt;, that this will throw an error because we

175
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
need to also include UnityEngine.UI

176
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And now,

177
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
text will be included, and that should work as

178
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
expected. So, of course this GetComponent&lt;Text&gt;()

179
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
will return a text component, which we''ll need to keep hold of.

180
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So, Text

181
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
myText; is...

182
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Save it like that! And that's going to be

183
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
a private, we don't need to talk to the

184
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
public about Text, and then, we simply say

185
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
myText

186
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
is the &lt;Text&gt; component.

187
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So brilliant! And now, when we

188
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
change the score... That's not ScoreKeeper! That just should be

189
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
score! What's going on here? That's score += points;

190
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And we do myText

191
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
=

192
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
.text. So, we're changing the text of myText

193
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and we're doing =

194
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
score

195
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
.ToString(); and that will change an integer into a string.

196
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And we do the same on Reset! We

197
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
really do exactly the same on Reset.

198
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So cool! Will this work? Well,

199
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
let's try that! Let's jump into our game, and let's press play

200
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and see whether we can score anything!

201
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So, the

202
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
first thing you'll notice is, the text is 999999,

203
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
which it suddenly should not be.

204
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So, let's pause the game and see whether we're actually capturing

205
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the ScoreKeeper score. And we're not! You can see in the Score

206
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Keeper Script, the score here is 0.

207
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Nothing is coming up in the Console, so something is going

208
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
off. What is going wrong? We're

209
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
not calling score at all, so let me make sure that that's the case,

210
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
by using my impressive

211
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Debug message functionality

212
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and doing ("Scored

213
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
points");

214
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Save that! And then

215
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
in my EnemyBehavior... [laughs]

216
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
What have we not done in the EnemyBehaviour? Well, we never actually passed the

217
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
score to the &lt;ScoreKeeper&gt; did we? So, let's do that now!

218
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now, let's create a private ScoreKeeper!

219
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And set that, when we retrieve it from the Score object.

220
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
We save it as a private variable.

221
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Then, whenever we are shot,

222
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
which happens in OnTriggerEnter2D,

223
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
we will do scoreKeeper

224
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
dot

225
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Score(scoreValue);

226
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And you'll notice something! Score is red here,

227
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and why is that? Well, my scoreKeeper is not

228
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
public on Score, so I need to make my method public.

229
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I want to call them from another context, so both

230
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Score and Reset will need to be public.

231
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So cool! So, now if I jump back,

232
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
try that again.

233
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Oop, all errors have to be fixed

234
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
before you enter Play Mode. Have I

235
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
forgotten something important here? It looks good to me.

236
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Yes of course! scoreKeeper should have a lower case s.

237
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We're talking about a scoreKeeper instance here. Right!

238
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Let's go! Let's go!

239
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Here we go! Now, I have an updating

240
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
score! Brilliant!

241
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So, what do we need to do now? We've got

242
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the score coming up. Now, it feels like a game right?

243
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Now, it feels like you've got something you're aiming to

244
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
optimize! You've got a score you're aiming to beat!

245
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
This is exactly the beginning of your game, and now the parallax

246
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
effect in the background is giving it a really nice

247
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
feel. So brilliant! We have a score.

248
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
pretty simple stuff. Let's jump back into our code. I

249
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
only want to change one thing, which is I don't want 999999 to

250
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
be the default. I want 0 to be the default. So, instead of

251
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
putting it here I want to use a long number

252
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
in the actual scene, so I can

253
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
see what it looks like when there's a long number, and I can do things like

254
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
alignment, etc. I'm going to jump back into my code,

255
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and in my scoreKeeper I'm just going to reset my

256
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
text, my score, to 0 on Start.

257
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
So, Reset();

258
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Brilliant! And then, jump back, press play,

259
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and we should start on 0

260
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and we do indeed. And now, let's shoot some enemies,

261
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
get a good score,

262
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and die. Awesome!

263
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So, well done for getting this far! Well done for

264
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
actually managing to put the score together!

265
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We've done this before, but it's nice to go over some stuff again.

266
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And we're done! We're keeping the score, we've

267
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
attached it to the UI Element. We

268
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
can move on to some more interesting stuff. I will see you

269
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
in another video very shortly! Bye for now!
