Hi there. it's Sam here again. and I am going to be showing you how to upgrade

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.600
Laser Defender to Unity 5. So. the first thing we need

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.600
to do is obviously fire up Unity 5. You'll notice I have a couple of version here.

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.600
I'm going to go for Unity 5 rather than Unity 4. for obvious reasons.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.600
and then. we'll hit Open and locate our Laser

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Defender project. And what we should be getting here

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.600
is. there we go. an automatic dialog which tells us

8
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.600
that Unity can't upgrade this project without

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.600
changing your script files. That's because the script files are

10
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.600
using some obsolete API's. which now it needs to go ahead and

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.600
update. and it's very cleaver. almost magical. that it does this all for you. And

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.600
we're going to be able to see what those exact changes are. So.

13
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.600
it does ask you to make a backup. so that's a

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.600
very good idea in a larger project where you may or may

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.600
not get the automatic tool to do a good job and you want to

16
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
make sure that you have a backup. and generally. using version control is a

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.600
good idea if you know how to do that. If not. don't worry just go ahead and make

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.600
a .zip of your folder and keep it somewhere. And I have

19
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.600
a backup. so I'm going to go ahead and hit that little blue button

20
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.600
and let Unity work its magic for me. Now. let's just open

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.600
it up on a different desktop but I'll bring it across.

22
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.600
and here we have our Unity screen. or as normal slightly

23
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.600
resized and weird. But we can go ahead and check out

24
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.600
that our game is working as intended. that we

25
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.600
can hit start and we can play and you

26
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.600
can hear all of the music and everything coming through my speakers. That's fine! And

27
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.600
everything seems to be working just fine. But what has changed

28
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.600
here? Let's just take a look at my version control.

29
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.600
I'll bring that over. as well. So. here this

30
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.600
shows us a list of files that have. in fact. changed. Among

31
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.600
all these asset files that we aren't interested in and we've

32
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.600
seen change in other projects. we also have these

33
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.600
.cs files. so C# scripts. that have changed. And as you'll

34
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.600
notice. it's exactly the same as before. We have rigid

35
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.600
body2D has been changed to a more explicit GetComponent

36
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.600
<RigidBody2D> and so on. And we've seen this happen before

37
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.600
when you tried to upgrade Block Breaker. I'll just get it to ignore

38
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.600
the password for now. And so. that's nothing new.

39
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.066
and it works as it did before.

40
00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:44.066
So. you may well have seen this challenge slide coming. I'd like you

41
00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:48.066
to create a Web GL build. using this new upgraded project in

42
00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:52.066
Unity 5. and then. share that with your friends. So. I'd

43
00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:56.066
like you to check your game in Unity 5 first. Make sure everything is

44
00:02:56.066 --> 00:03:00.066
working as it should do. and if not. go and post a question against this lecture

45
00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:04.066
and figure out how to get it working. if you can;t figure it out by yourself of course.

46
00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:08.066
And then. make your Web GL build. and once you've done

47
00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:12.066
that. I'd like you to put it on Game Bucket and then share it with social media.

48
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:16.066
share it in the comments in the Q & A.

49
00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:20.066
And then. when you've done that. with that you can move on

50
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:24.066
to the next video. If you're unsure about how to do any of this. check out some of the

51
00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:28.066
previous upgrading to Unity 5 lectures. where the full instructions on

52
00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:32.066
uploading to Game Bucket are there.
