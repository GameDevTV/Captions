00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
So hi. and welcome back! In this video
we're going to be polishing our menu

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.840
system a little bit further. So.
we've got a menu system for our little

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.730
Laser Defender game. but we have several things that are missing really. that

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.420
would make the game feel a lot better. So
firstly. is that we have no music in the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.990
game that's really suitable. We have
taken a cross weaver.  pulled across the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.710
music from a different game. but it's not
really suitable for this one. And

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.079
secondly. it would be much nicer if we add some texture to the background

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.670
of our many systems. right. When we go... When we start the game. right now we just have

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390
a black screen and it'll be nice to have
something a little bit cooler in the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.239
background. So. let's go and talk about a
little bit more about the music. So..

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.770
we're actually going to be using some
music from www.opengameart.org. by

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.969
an artist called clear side. and he's
licensed his music under Creative

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.059
Commons. which means we are able to use it and share it with you. and in fact

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.030
his four tracks that he's shared are available for free in the Acid Bundle at the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.110
beginning of this section. And what we
really want isn't just to add music to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.299
our scene. we've already done that. so it would be really simple to just replace the music

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.000
file by a different one. but actually we
want to do something a little bit more.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.799
We want to change the music. so that every scene has its own music... it's own

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.330
soundtrack. So how are we going to do that? Well. we're going to use the function called

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.950
OnLevelWasLoaded(). and this OnLevelWasLoaded() function will let you get a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.689
message. whenever a level is loaded and
then. you can start playing

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.500
the appropriate track for that level. So
awesome. let's get started with adding

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.740
some music. So. where do I want to start? I've got the four tracks here. I've got

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.930
my game here. While I'm going to start by
thinking about what would it take for my

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.329
music player to play the right music. So.
we're going to start by removing

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.619
the existing audio clip in our audio source. That's the clip that's playing by default.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.869
I'm going to say none. no clip will be
playing by default. and I'm going to jump

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.979
into my music player and see  how I can get the music files playing. when I want them

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.040
to. Right now. the music player script

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.219
only makes sure that the music player
persists throughout scenes. so that the

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:21.170
music can continuously play. Well. what I'm going to want to do is say. I've got three

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.359
audio clips. Those are my three audio
files. and I can define them as public

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:35.260
AudioClip. And I'm going to go startClip.
and then. I'm going to go for gameClip

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:44.400
and endClip. So those are my three files. my three clip music clips. and I want to be able

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.349
to play those depending on the level. So.
how am I going to decide... firstly. how am I

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.340
going to play any clip whatsoever?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.060
Well. the way to play clips is through an audio source. so I'm also going to need access

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:06.049
to my audio source. So. let's create a
private AudioSource. and I'm going to call

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.010
it music. So now. I need to define what
this music is. Those public audio clips

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.560
I'm going to drag and drop into the Inspector. but what about this music thing... this audio source?

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.199
What I'm going to... define it here. by grabbing the appropriate

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.349
component from the object I'm attached to. So I'm attached to

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.530
the music player object. and this music
player object will have an audio source

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:39.569
and I can simply grab it from my...
self. basically my game object. So. here we go.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.349
now my music is an audio source. and
what I can do next is play some music. So

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.269
if I jump into now this OnLevelWasLoaded function. and lets

00:03:51.269 --> 00:04:00.530
try it now. We go void OnLevelWasLoaded. and it will take in an integer. which

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.960
will be the level that has just been
loaded. So now. we've got this OnLevelWasLoaded function.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.380
The first thing I'm actually going to do is I'm going to Debug.Log..

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.329
and the reason for doing that is if
I've miss typed my function. if I've

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.310
got a problem with... I want to make sure... I want to not have to assume this thing is

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.829
being called. I want to be able to prove
it's being called.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:28.090
and the way to do that is to have a
custom log message and go ("MusicPlayer:

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.340
... spell that right.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:40.830
loaded level " +level); So now.
every time I lower the level my music player will

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.580
say hey. music player. I've received the
message for loading levels. So what do I

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.229
want to do whenever I load a level in the general case? Well. the first thing I want to do

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.909
is stop the music... stop the existing music. We're in a new debt level. so I'm

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:56.319
going to stop the existing music. That's the first thing I'm going to do. Then. I'm going

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.119
to change the audio clip. and the way
to change the audio clip is to go

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.800
music.clip = startClip. For the moment.
I'm just going to go with start clip. whenever we

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.770
changed a level. and once I've done that
I want to do... Most importantly.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.419
don't forget to stop the music from playing again. right. So now. that's the kind of logic

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.129
and then. depending on which level we
have. we're going to load a different audio clip. So

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:28.560
let's put the logic in now. it's very simple.
We can do if (level == 0) then. we load

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:36.370
the startClip. and that's easy enough to
do. And we can copy this logic for the

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.289
different levels. Let's do level 1 and
level 2. which are all the levels we have

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:47.300
in our game. So level 1. what... music should I be playing? Well. thats going to be

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.039
the game music game clip.

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:57.400
What about level 2?  Well. that's going to be the end clip. So now. I've got the clips

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.409
loading and playing. One thing left to do is I'm going to go music.loop is true. and

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.839
that just tells the audio source that I
want to loop this clip forever and ever.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:15.940
until I tell you otherwise. So. let's get started! Let's try this out! This is missing only one thing

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.700
now and that is the sounds. We don't have the sounds. We've got gaping

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.680
gaps in our music player script. which is
missing the sounds that we want to show

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.990
off and show to the player. So. to do that.
I'm going to need to import some sounds.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.300
and I'm going to create a new special
folder. in MySounds. which is going to be

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:41.640
music. which is going to be reserved to only music. And then. I'm going to jump into my

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.350
Finder. grab all the music files. I've already
got them selected here. and those you'll

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.930
find in the bundle... in the asset bundle at the beginning of this section...

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.540
Drag them in. drop them in. and it will take a little bit of time for Unity to load

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:02.220
everything and process all the files. but
it will eventually get there. And done! So now.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.080
we've got all the files loaded. One thing
to do is to convert all of them into 2D

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.780
sounds. I don't want any 3D sounds. 3D sounds are great. when you've got objects in

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.690
the game scene that make some sound. but this is all like. for example. lasers

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.700
and beams and explosions. but that's not
what I want. What I want here is just

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.420
music... is just background music. for the
player to enjoy while he's playing the

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.450
game. to give a little bit of atmosphere.
so I don't want them to be 3D sounds. So.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:37.760
I'm disabling all that and done. And
obviously. disabling 3D will mean that

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.820
Unity has to reprocess the file. which can
once again take a little bit of time. Awesome!

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.570
So now. we've got a bunch of tracks. we've got a music player missing some tracks. and

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.520
obviously. you can choose whichever track you want for whatever... the

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.500
start... the game... the end... And you can also choose your own clips. you don't have to

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.980
use ours. In the same way you don't have
to use our sprites. you can use your own.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:07.580
I'm going to be selecting. below the shift. for my start music.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:18.449
that's the Start Menu Music Simulator for my game clip and Coma for my end clip.

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:22.279
So cool! Now. what happens if I press... Let's start on the Start menu. What

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:29.639
happens if I press play? Nothing! I can't
hear anything. Does it work when I press

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:34.300
Start? Yes. it does! So. what's going on
here? Why is it working for start. but

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.610
then. not working for the first scene? And
then. when we go back to the start. it

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.180
starts sounding again.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:46.660
Well. that's because the first level... never calls OnLevelWasLoaded.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.519
So. let's jump back into our code in
our music player. and what we're going to do is.  we're

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:55.410
going to set a default clip to play.
whenever we get started. and that's going

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:02.660
to be music.clip... is going to be the
startClip. and we're going to set

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:11.930
that to loop. And to do loop. you do loop = true. and then. finally we're going to

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:19.300
get that playing. Awesome! So now. we have our music playing. We should have music

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:26.110
playing. when we press Start. And let's try it now. and we do indeed. The first

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:31.510
moment you press play. you get some music sounding. So. cool! So. we now have music

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:36.050
throughout our game. and every scene.
every level in the game. has a different

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:41.290
soundtrack. which is exactly what we
wanted. So. what's next? Well. next is your turn.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:47.709
Next. is your turn to make...
some texture... give some texture to the

00:09:47.709 --> 00:09:51.769
Start Menu's background. So... I
suggest we add a star field;

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:53.720
I mean. this is a game in space.

00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:59.490
Let's add a star field. and it'll prime
the player to expect a star field in

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.319
the game. as well. and it'll kind of tie all
the different levels together. So.

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:06.399
that's what I would suggest you do. So. pause the video now. add some background

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:11.490
texture to your menus. either an image or
a star field or something else. and feel

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:19.660
free to copy and paste the particle
system that you've got in the game scene.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:27.240
So. how did it go? I'm going to be very
very cheeky and go into my scene. I'm

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.380
not even going to modify my... I'll just make sure I save everything. I'm not even going to

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.200
modify my star fields. I'm going to go grab
them.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.150
copy them is Command and C or control and C. then. jump back into my Start Menu.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:46.750
and paste them in my hierarchy. Great and same for the Win Screen. I'm going to save my

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:51.530
scene. and paste them in the hierarchy
and save my scene again. So what happens now.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:59.340
when I'm on the Start Menu and I press
play? Well. I have a star field in the background.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:07.840
Brilliant stuff. right? And one less thing
we'd like to do is actually change

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:14.760
the text. from You Beat Block Breaker to be You Were Defeated. Make sure the text

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.240
matches the game. right. We don't want to talk about another game. in this text. So. You

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.820
Were Defeated! And so that's great. we've got. You Were Defeated here. and we are done.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.630
We've got the menu systems good to go!

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:31.930
That's it for this video! I hope you
enjoyed it. and I will see you in another one!

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.480
So it's bye for now!
