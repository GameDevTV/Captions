00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.260
Hello. and welcome back! In this video
we're going to be building a spaceship.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.590
So what about our spaceship? Well. we just want a spaceship we can control.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.110
that's going to be our defender. He's going to be moving in the play space from side to side.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.780
and that's what we want to do. So what's the first step in building a spaceship?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.340
Well. the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to grab

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.449
some assets. and I found some brilliant
assets on a place called open game art.org.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.620
and in fact. it's a great website for
your asset needs. In fact. we've bundled

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.070
all of those assets in our download at
the beginning of the section. If you want

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.579
to get ahold of it. Also if you want
to grab them yourself. they're all on this

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.629
website called open game art .org. and
we're talking about the space shooter

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.469
redux. and there's a whole bunch of space
assets and our laser defender is going

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.899
to be our little space ship right here. So
let's do it. Let's jump straight in and

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.380
get that done. We want to add the asset
and we've got it from Unity so I'm

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.200
just going to jump back into Unity. and I'm going to import some assets. so the way

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.600
I'm going to do that. I'm going to find them in my browser. I've got my finder here.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.680
I'm going to go to the right place on my desk and grab the assets. so got laser

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.880
defender and it's going to be in the
bundle. And that's the bundle you download and it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.820
going to be in space shooter redux. Why it's all the way there on the right I have no idea.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.020
So let's take a look and what assets do we want for our spaceship?

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.970
We're talking about the players spaceship. and I kinda like the look of the blue dude.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.450
That blue guy is the one I like. so I'm
going to grab that and I'm going to drag and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.829
drop it into my Unity editor. If I
grab it and drop it on the Asset Pane.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.200
it'll create a sprite. I can actually bring it to

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.380
Assets. Let's jump in there. Let's see? Has
it been imported properly?

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.420
Yep. sprite 2D in the UI.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.830
if it hasn't been imported as a 2D
sprite don't forget you can always

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.800
change that by going to the Inspector
and you've got the actual item selected

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.220
So I don't actually care about this scene
right now. so I'm going to jump back out

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:28.100
into my game. Save whatever changes I've made here. Let's get started with our 2D game. So the first thing we're going

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.080
to do is grab our sprite and drop him in.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.820
So. we've got him in the play space. Let's zoom in a little bit. so we can actually see it.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.690
Have we got a player ship here?

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:55.880
Yes we do. It's not huge. It's fine. We can deal with that. We'll recenter it. to make sure

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.300
it's all at the origin. and if I've got
that right and then I can

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.360
just double-click the ship. and here we are. So that's our player ship. So we've got this player.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.360
He's going to be our little space ship. and our job is actually now to make sure we can

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.760
control him. We can actually get him
moving the way we want to. and in fact.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.530
that is once you've downloaded his assets and imported them to Unity. that's your job.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.769
and that's your next job. I want you to
add a script to your ship so drag and

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.720
drop a script or create a new script onto
your script. Call it PlayController that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.320
script. and get it to move the ship left
and right with the arrow keys. You need

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.060
to make the speed adjustable in the
editor. because that requires a lot of

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.239
tuning. So pause the video now. and add a
controller script to your starship. To your

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.410
little starship sprite to make sure it
can move left and right. based on your

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.450
arrow keys. Now. I know this is a little
bit of a bigger step and challenge than

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.500
we're used to. but don't worry too much
don't stress out take it slow. Remember

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.170
to break it down into smaller problems. So add a script; add a function inside  your

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.799
update. Rather add an if statement inside your update that checks whether the right and left arrow keys

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.489
have been pressing. and if you're not quite
sure how to. Go back and have a look

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.210
at the Text 101 game we made. which uses the keyboard. and you'll need to find out

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.979
the key code for left arrow and right
arrow. And then once you've done that

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.889
it's a simple matter of changing the
transform's position. Modifying the

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:39.599
transform's position. the way we did in
Block Breaker for moving the paddle. so

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.139
take a look at Block Breaker code for 
moving the paddle if you're not sure

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.960
and take a look at the Text 101 code for
grabbing the keyboard input if you're

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:57.280
not sure. And once you've done that.  I will see you and we will go through it together. So see you soon.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.240
So here we are. we have our ship in our editor. How do we get a script on and get it to

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.970
move from side to side

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.860
based on the arrow keys? Well I'm going
to just add a component to my...  I've got

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.900
the ship selected. Actually I'm going to
rename it player ship one blue doesn't

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.080
sound good. so I'm just going to call it Player. Oops not play. but Player. So I've

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.500
got my player. and I'm going to add a component to it. That's going to be a new script.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.860
there's going to be a player controller and that's the script responsible for controlling the player

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:39.860
and I'm going to edit that script now. so
here we are we have mono coming up. and

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.150
let's get this ship moving. So how are we
going to do that? Well you've seen this

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:58.800
before. We just go: if Input.GetKey
and we're going to go left and right arrow.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.280
That's KeyCode with a capital K.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:15.120
KeyCode. And it'll give you left arrow. so
that's moving my ship left. I want my

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:26.950
transformed.position to be  +=
a new. So I'm changing my position

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:34.160
by a vector. so that's X. Y. &amp; Z. And I really want to move it in some distance in the

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.460
X-direction. so I'm going to have. lets
say if I'm moving left I want a negative

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.100
X direction. so that's minus. and
that's going to be my speed of my

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.880
little star ship. And I don't
have this defined just yet but that's

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.120
ok. I don't want to move up. I don't want it
to move down. and I do not want it to

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.710
move in and out of the actual game world. So that's it. Our speed isn't defined. so

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.840
let me to define that now. Publicly expose a speed variable. I've got a public speed

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.889
and that's going to be a float. and I
want to start with a speed of say five.

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:21.590
And don't forget the f if declaring float
variables. And I'm going to do exactly

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:28.080
the same thing for the other direction.
and in fact if you want to pause now and

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:38.919
get that done. feel free to. Really it's
identical. GetKey now on the KeyCode. Now on the right

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:48.790
arrow. and once they've got that key code
sorted. I want to change the position of

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:55.570
my ship. with a positive speed in the

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.260
X-direction this time. So let's save that.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.220
See what happens. so we can remove all the

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.860
stuff we don't need yet. We have an update function.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.720
You move your keys. it'll move your ship
left and right. So we can adjust the

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.100
speed in the editor. and I'll show you a
little trick in just a sec to make that

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.940
speed frame rate independent. So let's
jump back into Unity. We've got a ship.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:26.690
Let's play the game... [Fumbles Words] I did a boo boo here.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:34.620
Yep. what else? Yeah. I forgot my if. it's
else if not just else. So I save that.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.039
jump back into Unity. and try again.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:45.709
And whoa. that's rather fast! Great. so we've now got our ship moving left and right.

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:49.690
We really need to be able to tune that. and
we thankfully have a speed.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:55.290
Let me tune it in RUN Mode. and save that. Go back into my game and it's a lot more

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.020
reasonable. now. So we've got the ship moving left and right.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.140
Let me jump back into my scene. to pause the game.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:08.780
I might move it down a little. so it's at the bottom of my screen. If I go back to my game that's perfect!

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:16.620
If I play again... let's set the
default speed to 1. shall we. So jump back

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.510
into our code. Now. actually I'm going to do a little trick here. I'm actually going to

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.240
multiply my speed. I mentioned that I
would make its frame rate independent by

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.840
Time.deltaTime

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.140
And that means that's the time it
takes between frame updates. That way

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:41.330
if the frame takes longer to
render then. it'll always have a higher

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:46.360
speed. and if it takes less time to
render. it'll move by a lesser increment.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.820
So let's try that to make sure that
we've got the right factor. given that we're multiplying

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:56.840
now by the Delta to the time between
frames. So if we jump back into Unity and press play.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.990
We might find that that's now a little bit
sluggish. In fact. because we're now multiplying

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.540
by a small number.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:08.500
Frames render really quickly. so let's change that default to something a

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:15.150
little bit more friendly for us. We jump
back into MonoDevelop and I'm going to put a

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:25.990
default of maybe say 15. Jump back into
Unity. Let's  test it out. Don't forget that if you

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:32.410
update the default but you've changed it in the editor itself it''ll not update.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:37.640
So you'll need to update it here as well

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:46.240
Alright. ok that seems more reasonable. So let's do a quick recap. We have created a

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.430
player controller script. which controls
our little star ship which we just created.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:56.200
and we've used the key getting and we've changed the transform to move it about

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.960
We've also made sure that
the position and the movement

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.750
speed is independent of the frame rate by
using Time.deltaTime. So we now

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.690
have a player controller script that moves our player about. So well done for

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.360
getting this far. Congrats! Hope you enjoy the video. and I will see you in the next one.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.190
Bye for now.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,260
Hello, and welcome back! In this video
we're going to be building a spaceship.

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,590
So what about our spaceship? Well, we just want a spaceship we can control,

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,110
that's going to be our defender. He's going to be moving in the play space from side to side,

Have we got a player ship here?

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:55,880
Yes we do. It's not huge. It's fine. We can deal with that. We'll recenter it, to make sure

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,300
it's all at the origin, and if I've got

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,760
control him. We can actually get him
moving the way we want to, and in fact,

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,530
that is once you've downloaded his assets and imported them to Unity, that's your job.

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,769
and that's your next job. I want you to
add a script to your ship so drag and

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,720
drop a script or create a new script onto
your script. Call it PlayController that

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,320
script, and get it to move the ship left
and right with the arrow keys. You need

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,060
to make the speed adjustable in the
editor, because that requires a lot of

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,239
tuning. So pause the video now, and add a
controller script to your starship. To your

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,410
little starship sprite to make sure it
can move left and right, based on your

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,450
arrow keys. Now, I know this is a little
bit of a bigger step and challenge than

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,500
we're used to, but don't worry too much
don't stress out take it slow. Remember

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,170
to break it down into smaller problems. So add a script; add a function inside  your

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,799
update. Rather add an if statement inside your update that checks whether the right and left arrow keys

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,489
have been pressing. and if you're not quite
sure how to. Go back and have a look

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:23,210
at the Text 101 game we made, which uses the keyboard, and you'll need to find out

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,979
the key code for left arrow and right
arrow. And then once you've done that

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:31,889
it's a simple matter of changing the
transform's position. Modifying the

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:39,599
transform's position, the way we did in
Block Breaker for moving the paddle, so

00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,139
take a look at Block Breaker code for 
moving the paddle if you're not sure

00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,960
and take a look at the Text 101 code for
grabbing the keyboard input if you're

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:57,280
not sure. And once you've done that,  I will see you and we will go through it together. So see you soon.

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,240
So here we are, we have our ship in our editor. How do we get a script on and get it to

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,970
move from side to side

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,860
based on the arrow keys? Well I'm going
to just add a component to my...  I've got

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,900
the ship selected. Actually I'm going to
rename it player ship one blue doesn't

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:21,080
sound good, so I'm just going to call it Player. Oops not play, but Player. So I've

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,500
got my player, and I'm going to add a component to it. That's going to be a new script.

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,860
there's going to be a player controller and that's the script responsible for controlling the player

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:39,860
and I'm going to edit that script now, so
here we are we have mono coming up, and

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,150
let's get this ship moving. So how are we
going to do that? Well you've seen this

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:58,800
before. We just go: if Input.GetKey
and we're going to go left and right arrow.

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,280
That's KeyCode with a capital K.

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:15,120
KeyCode. And it'll give you left arrow, so
that's moving my ship left. I want my

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:26,950
transformed.position to be  +=
a new. So I'm changing my position

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:34,160
by a vector, so that's X, Y, &amp; Z. And I really want to move it in some distance in the

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,460
X-direction, so I'm going to have, lets
say if I'm moving left I want a negative

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,100
X direction, so that's minus, and
that's going to be my speed of my

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,880
little star ship. And I don't
have this defined just yet but that's

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,120
ok. I don't want to move up. I don't want it
to move down, and I do not want it to

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,710
move in and out of the actual game world. So that's it. Our speed isn't defined, so

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:05,840
let me to define that now. Publicly expose a speed variable. I've got a public speed

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:13,889
and that's going to be a float, and I
want to start with a speed of say five.

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:21,590
And don't forget the f if declaring float
variables. And I'm going to do exactly

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:28,080
the same thing for the other direction,
and in fact if you want to pause now and

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:38,919
get that done, feel free to. Really it's
identical. GetKey now on the KeyCode. Now on the right

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:48,790
arrow, and once they've got that key code
sorted, I want to change the position of

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:55,570
my ship, with a positive speed in the

00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,260
X-direction this time. So let's save that.

00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,220
See what happens, so we can remove all the

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,860
stuff we don't need yet. We have an update function.

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,720
You move your keys, it'll move your ship
left and right. So we can adjust the

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,100
speed in the editor, and I'll show you a
little trick in just a sec to make that

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,940
speed frame rate independent. So let's
jump back into Unity. We've got a ship.

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:26,690
Let's play the game... [Fumbles Words] I did a boo boo here.

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:34,620
Yep, what else? Yeah, I forgot my if, it's
else if not just else. So I save that,

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,039
jump back into Unity, and try again.

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:45,709
And whoa, that's rather fast! Great, so we've now got our ship moving left and right.

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:49,690
We really need to be able to tune that, and
we thankfully have a speed.

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,290
Let me tune it in RUN Mode, and save that. Go back into my game and it's a lot more

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,020
reasonable, now. So we've got the ship moving left and right.

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,140
Let me jump back into my scene, to pause the game.

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:08,780
I might move it down a little, so it's at the bottom of my screen. If I go back to my game that's perfect!

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:16,620
If I play again... let's set the
default speed to 1, shall we. So jump back

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,510
into our code. Now, actually I'm going to do a little trick here. I'm actually going to

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,240
multiply my speed. I mentioned that I
would make its frame rate independent by

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,840
Time.deltaTime

00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,140
And that means that's the time it
takes between frame updates. That way

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:41,330
if the frame takes longer to
render then, it'll always have a higher

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,360
speed, and if it takes less time to
render, it'll move by a lesser increment.

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,820
So let's try that to make sure that
we've got the right factor, given that we're multiplying

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,840
now by the Delta to the time between
frames. So if we jump back into Unity and press play,

00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,990
We might find that that's now a little bit
sluggish. In fact, because we're now multiplying

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,540
by a small number.

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,500
Frames render really quickly, so let's change that default to something a

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,150
little bit more friendly for us. We jump
back into MonoDevelop and I'm going to put a

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:25,990
default of maybe say 15. Jump back into
Unity. Let's  test it out. Don't forget that if you

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,410
update the default but you've changed it in the editor itself it''ll not update.

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,640
So you'll need to update it here as well

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:46,240
Alright, ok that seems more reasonable. So let's do a quick recap. We have created a

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,430
player controller script, which controls
our little star ship which we just created,

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,200
and we've used the key getting and we've changed the transform to move it about

00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,960
We've also made sure that
the position and the movement

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,750
speed is independent of the frame rate by
using Time.deltaTime. So we now

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,690
have a player controller script that moves our player about. So well done for

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,360
getting this far. Congrats! Hope you enjoy the video, and I will see you in the next one.

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,190
Bye for now.
