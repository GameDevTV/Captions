00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,929
So hello, and welcome back. In this video
we're going to be looking at how to add

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:14,799
enemies to our scenes, spawn an enemy, because we've got a player ship. If we take a

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,970
look at our game right now, we have a
player ship we can control, but we have

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:26,199
no enemy on the play space. So I think
it's time we added some. So what are the first

00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,660
things we going to do? Well, we're going
to create an enemy prefab. Create

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,989
a spawner that will generate an enemy at
runtime or created an enemy when it

00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:38,390
starts, and that's pretty much it. And in
fact, your first job is to create the

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,590
prefab. So go and dig into the bundled
artists download you got at the

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,000
beginning of this section, and make me an enemy prefab. So that will be whatever

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,710
ship you choose, whatever enemy ship
you'll choose as a prefab, that I can

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,890
dump into my game and use later. So
do that now. Pause the video and create

00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:07,470
an enemy prefab.

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,360
So how about that enemy? How did it go? I'm going to create my enemy

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,690
prefab just about now. So the first thing I'm going to do... I'm going to grab import assets so [Humming]

00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:28,890
I want to grab my new enemy sprite,
which I'm going to get from my assets. I can

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,060
look at that in the right repository. I
have got all my assets loaded in a

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,820
special repository down here.

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,119
My bundle of assets, in space shooter redux.

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,700
I go to my PNG folder, and which
enemy do I want? I've got an enemies folder. I think the

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,100
look of the black... the enemy black too looks quite threatening. I kind of like

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,750
that one. So that's going to be my enemy. And to bring it into our game, what do I do?  I drag

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,810
and drop it into my assets, and here
we go.

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,060
It's come in. It's come in as a sprite,
which is what I had needed. Which is

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,110
exactly what I want. I drop into my game,
and I've got an enemy. I'm going to rename it, this

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:22,920
dude, instead of enemy black 2, Enemy, to make it very clear. No confusion. And I want

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,700
that as a prefab. Drag it back, and I've
now got a prefab. I'm going to do some

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,000
organization now. I think it's getting a
little bit messy. I'm going to show you an

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,510
alternative way of ordering your folders
around. I'm going to create a new folder,

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:41,580
which is named Entities; if I can spell that
right. If you haven't thought... if you

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,600
haven't figured it out, yet my spelling
is pretty bad. I'm going to create a new

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,280
folder inside Entities, which is my Enemy. And I'm also going to create a folder

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,110
inside my Entities, which is going to be
my Player. So that's just an alternative

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:07,680
way of organizing your CEO assets, and I've got to grab everything that's to do with

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,260
my enemy. So that's my enemy prefab and my enemy sprite and everything else, and I'm going to put them

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,460
in my Enemy folder.  And I'm going to do the same with stuff that's to do with my player. I'm just gonna

00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,040
grab all of that and put it in my
player folder.

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,900
Here we go! Cool! So now, we have an Entities folder,

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,820
with a player and an enemy. I've got my enemy prefab. So how about we get an enemy

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,280
spawning at the beginning of the game?
Create an enemy, an enemy spawner.

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,880
What's the first thing I'm going to do? Well, I'm going to create an empty game object. So in

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,100
my empty game object, I'm going to rename this guy. I'm going to rename him

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:54,130
to enemies or Enemy Formation, which is a way of saying that's the enemy that's now going

00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,330
to attack me. And so my enemy formation, we want at the beginning of this game. We don't want

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,850
an enemy in the actual play space. I can delete that one. Remember, it accepts delete because

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,170
it's a prefab and you can tell because
it's blue. So I'm grabbing my enemy and I'm

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,120
deleting it, and I've got an enemy formation and the first thing I want to

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,750
happen in my game, is an enemy arrives at the enemy formation. So let's check out

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,860
where the enemy formation is. Well its at

00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,680
00. That looks about right to my eye, to compare to my here ship, so that sounds

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,010
ok. And I want to export an enemy
so I'm just going to create a new component

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:38,460
called EnemySpawner. It's a script. It's a
C# script. Create and Add. And I'm

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,860
going to spawn an enemy at runtime. The
first... the only thing I want to do

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,420
is create an enemy. No auto-save has been found for this file. Wow, what is going on!

00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, I don't know I [Mumbles] use original file. That sounds about right. So here we go,

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,400
we've got an enemy spawner. On start I want to create a new enemy. So what I'm going to do...

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:06,110
use to create my enemy, is the Instantiate function, and this Instantiate function... If I can

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,230
spell it. Here we go, Instantiate. The first
thing it takes, and you can check it out

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,590
by opening the parent, is an object. And
I'm going to take in an enemy

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,840
prefab object,

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,840
which I don't have yet. I don't have that
defined... what that is or where that is.

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,420
I'm going to take a position and a quaternion. Now, you don't need to worry too much.

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,660
about what a quaternion is. It's basically about the rotation of the thing, but we don't

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,470
need to worry about that too much.
The vector 3 position is going to be a

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:48,350
new Vector3, not vector 2, and I'm
going to put it at the origin and my

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:56,260
quaternion I can put in, Quaternion.identity
And that will not have any rotational

00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:03,010
effect. So what's this enemy prefab? Well,
I'm going to pass that into my editor,

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:10,630
through my editors, through drag-and-drop. So I want a public GameObject enemyPrefab.

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:22,250
Right! Awesome! So now I've got this enemy prefab. I can save it; save my script.

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,160
And no special characters coming randomly, because I'm typing the wrong thing on

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,860
my keyboard. So I've  got my enemy prefab. I go back into my editor, and that should

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,419
appear shortly. And then I can drag
and drop my enemy prefab into my script,

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,750
and on start i should see that. When I
play the game right now, there's nothing

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,400
there, but when I press play, drum roll,
yeah an enemy appears. Brilliant! So now, we've

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,889
got an enemy coming up in our scene.
Hopefully you managed to create the

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,700
prefab yourself. You've got so far, we
are asked to get the enemy appearing on

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,630
start. I want to make sure that, instead
of being at the top level here, my

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,570
enemy is under my enemy formation. Enemies are in a formation, and I want to keep my

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:15,580
scene hierarchy tidy, and so to do that
I'm going to change my scripts. So stop the play..

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:23,840
Jump back into my script. So I'm going to get my enemy, I wanted to be under enemy

00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,110
spawner. So under the enemy formation,
remember the enemy spawner script is

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,800
attached to the enemy formation.

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,979
So the transform I've got access to,
within my enemy spawner, is the

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:40,039
transform of my enemy formation, and so
what I want to do is make sure that the

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,530
enemy gets instantiated inside the enemy
formation and to do that I once have... What

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:52,669
I can do is get my enemy out of
instantiate. So I want a GameObject

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,159
enemy, and that's the actual enemy that
we've just created here using instantiate.

00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:06,569
And I have to here type, as GameObject,
because what comes out of instantiate is

00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,870
actually an object and not a GameObject. So we need to tell it,

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,629
hey dude, this instantiate function is a
returning object. But actually I'm just going

00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,900
to consider it a GameObject, and this is
what this as GameObject does. And the

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,500
syntax highlighting will catch up with
us I promise.

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,250
Space sheep [Laughs]. Here we go, the syntax highlighting has caught up with us now.

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:36,010
So transform, to change the enemy's
parent in the scene... in the scene graph.

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,329
Right, we can do

00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:45,480
enemy.transform, and it has a dot
parent property and we can set this to

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,470
be equal to our transform. So that's
the transform of whatever this enemy

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,920
spawner script is attached to. In our
case that would be the enemy formation.

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,220
So if we save it now, and we jump back
into our scene and press play, we should

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,589
see that the enemy is spawned within
the enemy formation, neatly keeping

00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:13,660
everything in its place. We've got an enemy formation and an enemy clone there. So brilliant! What

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,660
have we done? Let's take a look at what
we've done so far. Have we've built a spawner

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:25,020
that is attached to a GameObject and
that as a reference to an enemy prefab,

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,630
which it uses inside instantiate, so the
beginning of instantiate we pattern the

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,790
enemy prefab and create a new enemy? Yes, we have. We have built a spawner that takes in an enemy

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,500
prefab and creates it. Have we made sure that the new enemy we've just

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,630
created from the prefab template

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,170
is childed properly to a GameObject, so
that we keep our scene tidy and we know

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,690
where all the enemies are? Yes, indeed, we have. We've used the transform.parent

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,470
property to make sure that the enemy has
a parent of the enemy formation. So

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,560
that's it for now, in this video. We've now
happily created a spawner that will create

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,440
one enemy at the start of the game. We'll
be expanding on this a lot in other

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,250
videos, but for now, we've got this far.
It's a great starting point, so well done,

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,400
and I'll see you later! Bye for now!
