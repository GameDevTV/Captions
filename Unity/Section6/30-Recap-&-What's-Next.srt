00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080
Hey. so congratulations! You have made it all the way through laser defender! No small

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.910
achievement. well done. I really hope you
made the game you're own. if you haven't

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.209
it's a great time to just stop right now and go back. change the art. change the sound.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.910
change the animations. What else can they do. Brice. to really make this their own and make sure

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.130
they share it. Yeah there's lots of really cool improvements you can make to this game and

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.109
unique things you can do. So making
sure say the enemy's animate. when their

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.190
in formation is one thing you can do. one
concrete thing you can get done.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.430
You can certainly obviously use your own
assets for everything. but a cool thing you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.320
could do is actually to add an enemy type... another enemy type. Right now. we have

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.719
only one enemy. Adding a second enemy.
and then having different waves of

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.450
enemies coming in with different types...
that would be pretty cool! That would

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.649
give a lot of richness to the game. And
finally. we've got this health system

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.699
in place already in the game. So every
missile is actually causing damage

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.039
to the player or the enemies' health. but we're not really taking advantage of it. All the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.980
health we have is less than the missile damage. so it's a one hit kill.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.040
So you could really do something cool
by changing that and having missiles that do

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.659
different things from the enemies or
from the player. and also having multiple

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.710
lives for the player. so that you can
regenerate. Play around with the health

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.700
mechanics and make something cool. And look guys even if you don't change it at

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.340
all the most important thing is you
share it. Yeah. we want you to build it for the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.600
web and share it using game bucket.io and then pasting as we show you how to do

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.479
into the discussion groups. so that other
people can see it. And if you want

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.750
feedback from outside of our student
community. go to the Facebook group. which is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.479
facebook.com/unitycourse. And the
habit of actually sharing and putting

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.290
what you've created out is fantastic. Please don't make it precisely what

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.259
we taught you in the course. because that's a little bit lame. but even if you just change

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.960
something and share it that's great. You
can always re-share it as you customize it.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.990
And we love to see your work actually. We've been really impressed with the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.979
things you've already shared in the course. and we absolutely love to see what you do

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.870
with it. So please share it and

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.590
we'll definitely be commenting on it and
having a look and playing it. We've been playing all of the things you've shared.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.540
Yeah. it's great. we don't have to actually do any work. we can just play your games that you made. all day! So that's cool! [Laughing]
