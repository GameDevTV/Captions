00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,429
Hello, and welcome back! In this video we're going to be looking at how to create a

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,370
starfield. Now, why are we going to do that?
Well, because right now, our game looks a little

00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,820
barren. We've got a blank emptiness
behind the enemy ships. We've got

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,970
nothing in the background, to give it a
little bit more depth. So we're going to add a

00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,599
starfield. Give it some sort of parallax effect, to give the impression

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,099
of depth, and we are going to be using
the Particle System from Unity, to do

00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,090
this. So, what's a Particle System? Well, a Particle System is an object that Unity

00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,540
provides you with, and it is very
versatile, to create all sorts of

00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,280
interesting effects, from trails, from
smoke coming out of fires, from the fire

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,649
itself to things like...

00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,520
blood splatters,  when an orc hits your
warrior with an axe. So, that's what we're

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
going to be using, and we're going to
position the particles so they are moving

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,690
like stars would, if we were moving forward, very fast. And we're going to start

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:02,489
tuning the Particle System, to make it
look great. So let's get on with that! Let's

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,970
get started, and let's try and put a
Particle System in. So, right now, the

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,030
game looks a little bit barren, as I
mentioned, just black. How do we add a

00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,390
Particle System? Well, you go into the
Hierarchy, right click, and go Add a

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,060
Particle System. And we're going to change this name of the Particle System, to be Starfield,

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,440
and we're going to call it one, because we're actually going to have two starfields,

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,020
in the end. I've got my starfield, what am I going to do to it?

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,439
Well, let me select it, and you'll see
that when it's selected it's

00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,299
simulated... It's simulating. So whenever
you've got it selected, the particle

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,079
system will actually be running, and you
can stop and pause and do all sorts of

00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,479
things here, with the box dust created in the scene view, to change what the Particle

00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,440
System is doing, what time you're simulating it for. What we want to do is actually

00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,040
change it, so it looks like stars moving
down. So, the first thing we're going to do is,

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,060
we're going to change its shape. If we
zoom out, we can take a look, and we can see that the

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,070
Particle System is like a cone, really.
That's not quite what we want. We really

00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,849
want a field of stars moving down, so
let's turn that into a box first, So, I

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,649
select my star field,

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,060
and then, I go into my shape. There's lots
and lots of options in the Inspector, but I'm going to

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,540
concentrate on the shape. I'm going to turn
that into a box. So, now it's a box system,

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,280
and if we... zoom back in, we can see there's a box here. And really, we've

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,900
got this Particle System, and it's really too small, right now. So, we're going to make it

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,409
much bigger, and the way we're going to do
that is, we're going to change the X

00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:41,950
value of the box, to be something like
20. So, that way it's a much wider Particle

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,450
System, as you can see, and it'll cover
the entire play space. If it's not,

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,500
let's try it, now. Let's go back into our game,
and it's not quite covering everything

00:02:51,500 --> 00:03:01,250
yet, or is it? Well, how about we check the main camera, and the particle system. Not quite

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,489
covering everything, and it's a little
bit off-center. So we'll put it in the center,

00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:11,480
and we'll turn it into box width of 30, so it covers the entire width of the game.

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,489
So brilliant! Now, if I jump back into my game, the Particle System covers everything. So

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,359
let's go back into our scene and see what
we can do. Firstly, let's change the

00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,400
the rotation of that Particle System,
it's really in the wrong angle. We want

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,799
the particles to move down, so just change
the X rotation by 180

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,870
degrees, so that the particles are moving
down. And now, we don't want it to be in the

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,569
middle of the scene, we want it to start at the top. So I'm going to move it up and

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:41,510
now, we have a scrolling starfield. Now,
let's take a look at what it looks like

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,169
in the game. If I press play, what do we have? And there we go, we've got snow coming

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,669
down. So, what's the first problem here? I
mean the stars look a bit weird, and all sorts of

00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,220
things, so I can identify two problems,
besides just the look and feel of

00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,120
the Particle System, itself. The first one
is, the Particle System is currently

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,879
above the enemies, which is not what we
want. We really want it to be

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,989
something in the background, we don't want it to be in front of the enemies, so we've got that

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,459
to fix, and the second issue is, it only
starts after a little while. It kind of

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,440
starts; It needs a little bit of time to warm up. That is not good enough, we don't want

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,000
that. We actually want the Particle
System to already be there, as soon as we

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,420
start the game. So let's get these two issues sorted, which is A,

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,020
it's the wrong layer it's above the enemies, and 2 we need it to be

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,270
ready and running already, when we start the game. So, let's fix the first one, we go

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,260
back into our scene, we've got the starfield. I'm just going to change the Z layer of my

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,220
starfield, to be something like five, and this will put it below. Let's have a look

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,870
at it in 3D. You can see it now, it's
actually behind the enemy...

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,130
positions. So let me switch back to 2D mode, so now if I press play

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,770
the particles will be below the enemies.
Let's check that that is actually... appear...

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,500
happening. Yep, that's exactly what's
happening. So cool! Now, the particles

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,700
are below the enemies. Let's fix the fact that it only takes a little time to get started, and

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,300
that is a single option in the Inspector
and that is the pre-warm option. If we

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,390
take the pre-warm option and then, press
play. We'll see that the Particle System

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,780
is ready to go, as soon as the game
starts, which is the behavior we want. So,

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,120
brilliant! So, now we are going to be
playing around, a little bit, with the tuning. Really, the

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,800
first thing I want to do is change the
star size. The stars are much too big, so

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,180
let's go 0.2 or something, and that looks a lot more like stars. If we

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,740
have a look at it in the game, that's
more like a starfield than the other one

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,020
was. So, that's already a good scrolling
starfield. I think there's not quite

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,490
enough there; I think there should be more,
so let's add a little more particles.

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:58,370
Let's go for the Max Particle and say
jump to 5,000. Cool! And we want to change

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,650
the Emission Rate, so we can have more particles. The rate is 10 by time.

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,070
Let's change that to say 30. Here we
go! Now, that's more like it! A lot more

00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,790
particles here, and they are moving quite
quickly. I think we're going to keep it like that.

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,240
I think we're absolutely going to keep it
like this, that's a good scrolling

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,310
starfield. So now, it's your turn. It's
your turn to get started with exploring

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,270
Particle Systems. This is what I want you
to do, I want you to explore Particle

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:35,100
Systems. Spend some time, pause the video, and spend some time trying to

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,420
use Particle Systems to build different
stuff, right. Build different things, It

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,460
doesn't really matter what. I just want you to play around with the options of the

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,310
Particle System, get familiar with all
the different things.

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,470
Try stuff out, have a 3D scene maybe and
try stuff out in there, or try and

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,590
create a thruster effect, that you can
attach to one of the ships at the back

00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,860
or something like that. So, try and play
with Particle Systems. So, I'll see you when

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,270
you've had a little play around, with
Particle Systems. So now, you've played

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,130
around with a particle system, we can move on to the second part, which is turning this

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,970
into a game that has a sense of depth,
right. If we play it right now, it still

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,170
feels flat, and it feels flat, because
really while we still have...

00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,580
we have two layers, we have the enemy, and player, and the stars, it still doesn't

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,600
feel like there's a lot of depth to the
background. So, what we're going to do to add depth

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,680
is use something called parallax. So, parallax is the idea that as you move, things in the distance

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,820
seem to move less than things that are
close to you. Now, that completely makes sense, right.

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,630
Imagine yourself riding a bicycle, next
to a very tall fence, the chains of the

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,480
fence seem to scroll by you very very
quickly, but the building behind the

00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,060
fence doesn't move very fast, in
comparison. So, it's a really good technique

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:58,000
to give an artificial sense of depth,
and the relative speed of the two is

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,200
going to be what gives you this
impression that things are moving, that

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,160
you've got a depth in your background, even though you don't really. So let's jump

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,280
back. So, what we're going to do now is, because remember even though we're in the... even though

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,760
we're in... we can use 3D positioning, our
camera mode, if we select the camera,

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,430
is not a perspective camera, so it won't show depth. It's orthographic, which means it's

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,640
just a projection, so it means we won't see depths of things, even if the camera

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,390
is rotated. So, the Z position is just
about layering things within our view. So,

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,330
the next thing we're going to do is build a
second Particle System, and I'm going to

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,360
clone the first, using Control D, and then,
rename it Particle 2

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,200
Starfield 2. And I'm going to move Starfield 2 a little bit further back, so it's...

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,250
the stars themselves, the sprites won't layer over each other, so let me call

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,310
it say 6. And also, I'm going to change the
speed, and that's the only thing I'm

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,779
going to do is change the speed of
these particles, right. So, the start speed is 5,

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:10,620
and I'm going to do 2.5 and see what that
gives us. We're hoping for a change of

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,290
space, which we can clearly see, but now, we have a problem. Let's press play. You can

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,740
see that the second layer of particles stops halfway through our scene, that's not

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,260
good. Let's fix that. So, we jump back; we've got a second particle system. We're going to

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,130
change the lifetime of the particles, so
the start lifetime, instead of being 5

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,329
it's going to be 10, and you can see now
it's all the way back. So, if we press play,

00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:41,750
now, what do we get? Well, now it feels
like there's depth! I'm still not so sure about

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,720
that, because I think the background particles are too bright, so lets dim them a little bit,

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,430
right. Let's go back to our background system, the second starfield, and dim them

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,000
a little bit. So, what I want to do is change
the Alpha, so it's about half way around, and

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,279
then, try again. Here we go, now, the stars
in the background are darker dimmer to

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,250
show that they're further away, and now,
we've got a Particle System that looks

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,029
like we're scrolling through it. So now,
it's your turn! I want you to take a

00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:20,459
little time and play around with your
Particle Systems, in the background, until

00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:25,019
they are awesome. So, play tune until awesomeness! So, that means play

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,240
around with the shape, play around with the size, play around with the colors, until you've got a

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
background that you really like, that
feels like you're rushing through space,

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,480
shooting enemies down, rather than just
scrolling past a bunch of stars. So,

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,589
this is what I want you to do, now. Pause
the video and play tune, until your Particle

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:48,269
System feels awesome, and I will show you, when you get back, an example of what I did in that time.

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,770
So, welcome back! I hope you've got a cool
background! Here's what I turned up with, in the

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,730
meantime. So, this is what I did. If I
press... If I get the game playing again,

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:06,990
let me show you the effect. You can see
the stars rushing past me, and they're

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,720
kind of spreading as they get nearer, to
give us a really good sense of depth. We still have

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,090
a little bit of a problem with the stars
blinking off, at random time, but that's something

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,230
we can sort out later. In fact, let me figure out why that is. It's quite a big

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,800
Particle System, really, and just to show you what I mean, I've actually changed the type

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,470
of Particle Systems from normal to
boxes. So, from boxes rather to cones. So, instead of

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,140
being boxes, now, I've got a cone Particle Systems, and you can see the

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,080
different shape and size of the Particle
Systems here, the two starfields to, give

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:48,080
us this depth effect. So, I'm going to change my particle lifetime for the first one to

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,950
be much longer, in fact, and hopefully
that will stop our blinking out problem.

00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:00,740
Here we go, now, we've got a particle system of stars that rush past us in a great

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,480
effect. So, play around with stuff! Play
around with it!

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,160
Have a look at what you can get. I'm
sure you can get a much nicer looking

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,050
Particle System than this, so I'm
looking forward to what you can come up

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,570
with and share on the forums. So, that's
it for the Particle System, the introduction

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,160
to Particle Systems. I hope you've
enjoyed it, and I will see you in another video!

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,220
Bye, for now.
