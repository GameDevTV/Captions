00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.519
Hello. and welcome back! In this video we're going to be adding sound effects to our

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.679
game. Now. we've got a little space
shooter game. right now. but it sounds a

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.070
little bit dull... Well. it
sounds a little bit dull without sound.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.400
really. so let's take a look at what it's like. Let's take a look at the game.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.000
when we play it. so we can definitely shoot stuff down and we can definitely get an

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.539
updating score and we can definitely
get shot ourselves. Let me get

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.540
deliberately killed. So we can do all
that. but really without sound...

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.899
it's just not as good. The sound adds a lot to the game. So our task.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.000
now. is to add some sound to our game. That's basically it. and in fact. since you've

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.430
done this before. you're going to try and do that. You're going to be doing the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.070
player firing. enemy firing. and enemy dying sounds. So I want you to grab the sounds from

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.829
the assets we bundled at the beginning
of this section and used as sounds.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.250
or a sound you create or a sound you download yourself. to create some sort of

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.010
liveliness. whenever the player fires or
whenever the enemy fires or an enemy

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.390
dies. because it'll give a much better
feel to your game. And I'll see you in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.290
a few minutes. and I'll show you how I would go about doing just that. So pause

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.990
the video. now. Try and add some sound for when the player fires. the enemy fires.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.619
and the enemy dies. and I will see you
very shortly. to go through it. So. how did

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.840
you get on? Did you manage to get the
sounds added to your game. so that when

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.040
the player or enemy fires. they
make a sound. or when the enemy dies they

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.270
make a sound. And let's see how we would do that. So this is already a recap. and the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.460
first thing I want to do is grab my sound assets and import them into Unity. So to

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.549
do that. I'm going to jump into my folder. that's part of the bundled assets from the

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.869
package we had at the beginning of the
section. So. I'm grabbing all my sound

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.680
assets. and that's in the SFX folder. the special effects folder. and I'm dragging them

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.450
into the sound folder within my assets tab.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.300
So cool. so now I've got all the sounds in my game. Let's get started. I'm going to start

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.470
with my player. I'm going to open the player controller. and I'm going to add a public

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.940
audio clip. So. that's going to be the fire sound. right.  The public AudioClip

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.230
fireSound; that's going to be the sound of my guns and I'm going to drag and drop that

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.349
in the Inspector. and whenever we fire I
will also. as well as firing a beam or

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:49.599
projectile. I will also go AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint. and I'm going to play my

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.349
fire sound at my current location.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.730
my current location represented by the
position of my transform. So cool! For

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.579
now. I'm playing this sound. whenever
I fire. Let's jump back into our Unity

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:11.870
editor. and in this case. let's add the sound itself to the player prefab. So let's take

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.799
a look at the player prefab. There's now a slot open in the player controller script. for the fire

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.639
sound. Let's drag and drop our laser
sound into the prefab slot. Let's save our scene.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:30.380
and let's press play. So now. you should be hearing that. whenever I press the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:38.150
spacebar. whenever I shoot the laser. I get an isolated sound coming up. Brilliant! So what's

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.359
next? Well. next is my enemy. So. let's take a look at the enemy behavior script. and

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.819
this time we're  going to do exactly the same. We're going to create a public AudioClip.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.359
for my fireSound. but we're also
going to do something else. We're going

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:03.199
to create a public AudioClip. for my
deathSound.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.880
That sounds very morbid. isn't it.

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.910
Death sound and fire sound. so the fire sound is really exactly identical to what we did

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:22.150
with the player. We can do... so its AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint fireSounds...

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:31.520
Not fire pause but fireSounds and my current position. And now. we've got the...

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.580
sound playing when we fire. We can also
do a little bit of clean up. while we're here. Because

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.440
we no longer collide with projectiles. we no longer need to add

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.610
this offset here. So we can just use
transform.position. instead of fire

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:55.690
pause. which saves us two lines and cleans this up a little bit. Here we ago! And so. whenever we

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.810
fire. we instantiate a new projectile. give it some velocity. and play a sound.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.780
That's great! And next.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.050
whenever we die. as well as notifying the
scorekeeper and destroying the object. we

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:16.500
will also do an Audio Source and do the
same thing but play the death sound. Dot PlayClipAtPoint.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.659
and I want to play the death sound. at my
current position. dot position. Here we go.

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.979
So. now. I'm playing the sounds at the right position. I'm going to also extract this

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.210
stuff. We've got three lines here. I'm going extract that into a yet more morbid die

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.659
method. that's when the enemy dies. Grab
all the stuff and make it happen in a

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:46.919
function. make sure not to forget my
capital A. and then now. call the Die

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:53.320
function from the appropriate place in
my OnTriggerEnter2D function. Save all that. jump back

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.950
into my Unity. and this time I'm going to
add my appropriate sounds to my Enemy

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.300
prefab. Let's grab the sound. and for the
fire sound I'm going to use the SFX Laser 2.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.500
Obviously. you can use whatever you
wanted that doesn't matter all that much.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.080
and iSFX Lose for my death sound.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.780
Awesome! Let's save that scene and press play and see what happens. So. you can hear

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.889
my sound. my fire. You can also hear the
enemy fire. Let's try and destroy a few

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.570
and see what happens then. Can you hear that enemy being killed?

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:38.660
Yep. sounds good to me! And that is us done! We have now added the sounds. very quickly.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.340
to our little game. So. we now have not
only added some sounds for firing but for

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.020
dying as well. And obviously you can go
nuts. you can add sounds to many more

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.210
events in the game. not just the firing
and dying. but also things like let's say

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.490
once in awhile add a weird creepy sound
or anything you want. So. really go nuts

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.690
with sounds on the events. maybe add a
sound whenever the player dies or

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.100
something like that. or whenever. the
score goes up. instead of having a

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:15.479
player an enemy dying have a little clang or ching whenever the score goes up.

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.940
Anything like that. you can have a play around with. but that's the point. we've got the

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.240
sounds going in the game.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.650
It sounds so much better. and when it
plays... when we play the game. it feels

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.960
much cooler with the sounds actually in
there. So that's great stuff! I hope you

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.450
enjoy the video and I will see you in
another one! Bye for now.
