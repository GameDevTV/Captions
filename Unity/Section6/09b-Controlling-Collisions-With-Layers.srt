00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,269
Hello, and welcome back! In this video we're going to be looking at how to use layers to

00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,549
control collisions. So we have some problems in our game. The first one we had

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,939
was, the player shoots itself when its
firing. The lasers from the player and

00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:24,140
the enemies collide with each other, when
the projectiles from the enemies hit

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,990
other enemies and kill them, which it
makes the game, too, easy if the enemies are

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,570
shooting each other. So really we want to be able to control the collisions of those

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,670
projectiles. We want to be able to control
the collisions in our game in a

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,780
structured way, to say these things
collide with these things, and these

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,239
things do not collide with these things.
So let's, without further ado, take a look at

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,050
layers. So we've got a game here, and if I go back to my scene view and next

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,170
select my player, you will see this on
the top of the Inspector. You will see this layer

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,710
drop down, and right now, the layer has a
bunch of different ones and this is the

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,110
layer we're going to be using to change how collisions work. So let's without

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,750
getting started, we can see we've got
some layers here. Without moving

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,970
anywhere else... Without me doing anything, we're going to add a new layer. So we've got the

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,880
player selected. So let me create a new
layer, and you'll see you'll be taken straight to the

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,200
Tags and Layer View. That lets you
configure tags and layers, and you've

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,170
got different options. You've got tags, you've got

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,220
sorting layers, and we will go over those
in some other videos. For now, we're just

00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,470
worrying about layers and they're useful
collision. So, right now, I've got a player.

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,409
I'm going to put my player in a new layer called Friendlies, and this

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,250
layer will be about all my friendly entities. And at this point, we've got a

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,829
Friendly Layer, and the player itself now
can be added to the Friendlies

00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,229
Layer. You should see that, in the
Inspector, there is now a Friendlies

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,280
Layer coming up when you click on the
drop down. So let's do that. So what does

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,890
that mean, then? Well, the Friendlies Layer
lets us select how any

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,200
item, that has been attached to that layer, will react

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,060
with collisions. Let's take a look at how
we do that, now.

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,819
So if I go into my Edit Menu, I go into
my Project Settings, and I go Physics 2D.

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,400
Remember this is a 2D world,
there's the exact same options for 3D,

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,580
but in fact,  because we're in 2D we're using 2D components. We can see

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,000
we've got a Rigidbody2D; we've got a modified Physics2D. And here, at the bottom

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,590
of the Physics2D Inspector pane, you can see this little matrix of

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,720
check boxes, and what this matrix of
checkboxes does is it

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,700
lets you select what collides with what.

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,250
And at the moment, everything collides
with everything else, right? And you can

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,209
see that if, for example, I unchecked
Friendlies with Friendlies they would,

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,860
now, stop colliding with each other. So
the friendlies, anything that's attacked

00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,599
friendlies, would stop colliding with
anything else that's also attached to the

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,030
Friendlies Layer. So that's how you
control

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,849
collisions in a game. So, now, really it's
up to you. Now, you're next job is going to be

00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:13,370
to move the enemy... to create the Enemies and any projectiles and Friendly

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,950
Projectiles Layer and make sure that all the prefabs in the game are added to the

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,579
right layers. So, for the friendlies, I
want just the player ship. For the

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,980
enemies I want the enemies to be added
to that layer, and the enemy

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,640
projectiles should be the enemy lasers
and the friendly projectiles should be

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,220
the friendly lasers. So this is your job
now, to go around,  just the way I've shown

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,850
you. So feel free to rewind and play
again to see how I adjusted it

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:49,450
to put all the right GameObjects and prefabs in the appropriate

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,290
layers. So you'll have to create three
new layers thats

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,120
Enemies,  Enemy Projectiles, and Friendly
Projectiles, and you'll have to add all

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:05,280
the right things to them. So, I'll see you
very soon, when you've done all that. See you then.

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,900
Ok cool! So let's show you how I would do that. So let's jump back. I've already got one layer, and

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,889
you can always look at the layers by going to the Project Settings, just

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,070
like you do for Physics2D, but instead of Physics2D you go for the Tags and Layers

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,790
Menu. And you'll see that, now you have
the layers in the Inspector. I'm

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,860
just going to create all my layers here. So we've got enemies, we have enemy projectiles,

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,120
and we have friendly projectiles. So why
are we doing this? Why are we doing all this?

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,200
Friendly Projectiles. Well, we're doing this,
because we want to be able to control

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,010
collisions. We don't want things to collide, when we don't want them to.

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,220
The only thing we want to collide with
each other are the enemy projectiles

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,640
with the friendlies and the friendly
projectiles with the enemies', right. We

00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,880
don't want friendly fire or anything
like that. So let's get going with adding

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,850
everything to the right layers. I'm just
going to  jump into my Entities, grab my

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,979
Enemy, so that's my Enemy Prefab, and change the layer in my prefab to Enemies. I'm going to

00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,900
do the same with my enemy laser. I'm going to change the layer to Enemy

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,160
Projectiles. Now, I'm Jumping into my player. I'm going to grab my Player Laser Prefab. Remember it's

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,640
not the sprite, but the prefab. I'm going
to add that to the Friendly Projectiles;

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,830
similarly for my player. I've got a default, because I didn't apply my change to the player objects.

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,350
I'm just going to set that to Friendlies,
so now, I've got all four objects in the right

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,680
layers. So now, if I jump back... if I save
this game, now Command Save to save my

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,539
scene. If I press play the behavior
really hasn't changed at all, we really

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,400
haven't changed... although you'll see that this is happening, right here. We've got...

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,229
some projectiles are colliding with each
other, which is definitely not what we

00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,500
want to happen. So now, how do we get the projectiles to not collide with each

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,860
other. That was a perfect example of projectiles colliding, because there's

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,500
projectiles moving downwards and projectiles moving upwards. They collide, they stop,

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,400
and then, they get stuck. So now, we're
going to go into our Project Settings, our

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,560
Physics 2D Settings, and we have
this matrix at the bottom. Now, remember I unchecked Friendlies with Friendlies.

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,220
That's exactly what we want, and we want to change the bottom of that matrix, with

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,080
the friendlies, the enemies, the enemy
projectiles, and the friendly projectiles.

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,650
Let me make that a little bit wider for you, so we can see what's going on. Here we go! And with that

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,880
matrix, I want to deselect everything and
keep only two collisions. So, the only two

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,680
collisions I'm going to be keeping, so I'm deselecting everything and then I can

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,300
reselect it by hand. The only collisions I
want is friendlies, with the enemy

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,490
projectiles, so that's this one here, and
then, the enemies with

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,990
the friendly projectiles, which is this
collision right here. So now, I've got my

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,139
two collisions going. That should have the behavior we want, and we can try that,

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,950
now. That should be all correct. Everything should be working as we

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:11,200
expect it to, but now it's difficult to
get the case to happen to occur. But

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,510
now the collisions between say my enemy
projectiles and my friendly projectiles,

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,130
simply won't occur, so we'll never get that case where two projectiles hit each other and

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,669
get stuck in the middle of the game. And
we can check this by, let's say, disabling

00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:30,130
the friendly projectiles and... or rather, disabling the friendlies and

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,280
enemy projectiles, and you'll see that I
do not get hit by the enemies, rather they go

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,540
right through me. I don't whether you can notice that, but now, I've disabled the projectiles and their

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,270
lasers go straight through my player's
ship. So that was it! That was a nice short

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,190
video! Let's reenable that, make sure
I don't forget it.

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,570
Reenable, save my scene, and that was a nice short video to show you how to use

00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,930
layers, to control collisions within your physics settings. And remember, this is the same

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:05,639
in 2D and 3D, so you can do exactly the
same in your 3D world, when you make a 3D game. So that was it.

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,310
Hope you enjoyed that,  hope you found it useful, and I will see you in another video!

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,780
Bye for now.
