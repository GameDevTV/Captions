00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.450
So now. we're equipped with an
inescapable terrain and a first person

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.960
controller to explore it with. Let's start
placing trees and details. In this video...

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.680
How to place trees on your terrain. how to
paint grass details. about grass

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.130
and billboards. and the performance impact of grass. So. let's get

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.210
into the terrain. double click on it
maybe. dive in. and start taking a look at

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.890
a couple more of these terrain settings.
So. we've already covered raising and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.320
lowering. Painting Height and the fact
that's very similar. but it clamps the

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.219
height to whatever you choose here. You
can also flatten your entire terrain in one

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.980
button. if you want. Dangerous! [Laughs] Smoothing Height. which we haven't done. but

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.320
that just smooths out bumps in the terrain. which you may want to do at some point. Can be

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.780
quite nice to smooth the mesh out. Painting textures. we've already talked about.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.280
You can have different textures. you can add them on top of each other.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.640
I haven't textured up my terrain very much
yet. but you might well have already done

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.350
yours or be in the process of it. I might want to kind of paint these mountains. like this.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.650
Slap it on. Ben. don't worry about the style! So. you get the idea.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.790
Yep. so that was the painting. So. new stuff! Place trees! So. notice if

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.090
you click Place Trees that it says: "No trees defined." You need to Edit Trees and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.720
Add a Tree. Now. it's going to ask you for a tree prefab. so provided you've got the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.320
Environment Package installed. you should have some prefabs. What should we go for. for a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.420
zombie theme? I'm going to go for broadleaf trees. mainly. in this game.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.990
That's a mobile one though. so Conifer Desktop or Broadleaf Mobile? Which one should

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.210
we go for? I'm going to go for Conifer Desktop. There you go. And you can add that. and it just adds

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.950
it to the list of trees here. Ok. Then.
what you can do is go and find

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.909
yourself a bit of terrain. You choose
your Brush Size and you choose your Tree

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.189
Density. You can randomize the tree
height. Let me make this Inspector bigger.  You can

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.560
randomize the tree height here. and you can choose a range in which you randomize it.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.719
You can lock the width and height. which kind of keeps them in proportion. You can

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.970
choose a color variation there. if you
want.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.560
and you can just start painting trees. Look at that! Pretty cool. hey! I mean I've gone a bit

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.260
nuts. but that's the idea. You can just
start painting trees down on the terrain.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.540
It takes a little while to do it and to compute it. but once they're down they're down.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.880
Ok and that's pretty cool. as long as
you're still on the tree at all. Oh. gone a bit nuts there.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.540
You can also Mass Place Trees. and
if you click on Mass Place Trees what

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.480
that's going to do is it's going to just
place. into the whole terrain. maybe

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.200
1.000 trees. Let's do that.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.020
not keeping the existing trees. There you go. we have a forrest. [Laughs] Now. your performance is going to

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.760
really start to suffer. but at least. if you get
yourself down into the game view. look at this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.740
we're really... Oops. excuse that.  We're really starting to get some of Unity's leverage now. Look at this! I mean

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.800
Ok. it's all of it one type of tree and the performance might suffer. but look at all the work

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.320
that's being done for us by this engine here. Pretty awesome. Ok.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.980
So. actually I quite like the idea of
Mass Placing Trees. I think 1.000

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.380
may be too many. so I'm going to do an undo here. and get rid of those thousand trees.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.700
But I am going to mass place. myself. say 200 trees. not keeping the existing.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.440
because that's just a quick way of getting
a load of trees down. Now. you might say

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.440
well. what happens if I've got trees like on the top of the hill here. and I

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.440
want to get rid of the trees.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.290
Well. it says "Hold down shift to erase trees". So. if you see trees somewhere you

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.799
don't want them. you can hold down Shift. get yourself into a position where you

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:58.209
can see the trees. hold down Shift. and
you can delete that type of tree. Ok so.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.450
you can either mass place trees. like
I've just done and distribute them

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.660
around the terrain. or you can place them
individually by kind of painting them

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.590
as we have been or you can do some
combination of the two. And I'm not sure what tree is in

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.920
the bottom of the pond here. so let's get rid of them.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.590
But let's just preview this from the
standpoint of the first person and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.370
maximize. Ok. this will do. I mean you could spend a lot of time

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.300
making this prettier. but at least I have
some trees in the terrain. To reason the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.720
terrain. [Laughs About Misspoken Words] What I'm wanting to do is show you the principle of placing trees.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.780
If you want more types of trees you're welcome. and you can go across here. I'm not sure the palm

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.230
trees make the most sense. You could have a Broadleaf Desktop like that. and you

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.419
add it. Now. you suddenly have a second
type of tree there. and we could then. for

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.210
instance. Mass Place those broadly. So. we could have say 50 broadleafs. keeping

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.330
the existing trees. and then. when you go
into your world you'll find that you

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:04.169
have a mix now of broadleaf trees and those conifers. Ok so. it's pretty cool! So. we have

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.229
a mix of trees. I'm going to stick with that
for now.

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.160
Now. the second thing I want to show you.
in this part of the tutorial. is we go

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.100
over to the painting details. Now. you may be wondering about these brushes.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.340
They're just different shape brushes.
Why you'd want a star shaped brush. I

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.370
don't know. but when it comes to painting
grass then. painting grass with something

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.530
like the one I've got selected there. at the
bottom right. makes sense. So. you might want

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.870
that brush. Add a grass texture. Now.
when you add grass texture. this dialogue

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.789
will pop up. You can choose the little
dot there. type grass in the search.

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.789
and which one shall we have? Let's have this guy here. Ok. And then. you can leave

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.970
all the details as they are. but
before you click Add. just notice

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.210
Billboard. And what Billboard does for you is as follows. It means that the grass. and you

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.970
may have noticed this in games. it means
the grass will always face you. That's what that's going

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.960
to do. Ok. So. if we go to scene view. start placing down some grass. Now. this brush that I've

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.240
chosen is quite good for placing down
grass. but be quite conservative with

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:14.470
the grass. Oops. hang on. I've come off onto terrain hiring. Ok.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.590
Now. if you start painting and you think you can't see the grass.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.940
that's because of your draw distance. and
it's Unity optimizing for the draw

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.420
distance. So. you're going to need to be
quite close to the grass. in order to

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.940
better see it. Now. you can change the draw distances...  Oops. be careful. because

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.810
sometimes it'll automatically click across to a Paint Height. instead of details.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.570
Now. you can change how far into the distance Unity is rendering the detail. and it's

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.110
going to depend on how high you are off the ground and how much performance hit want.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.180
But if you want to change it. you go to Terrain Settings. and you'll see Detail Distance here.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.520
And if I turn it down. my world of detail
comes in. and if I turn it up. it goes out.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.600
Ok. So. it's up to you. Depends how fast your machine is. how fast the target platform.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.590
I'm going to make a draw distance of maybe 100 meters. Ok. So that's that. now back on

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.140
these Billboard business. If I come down
and look at this grass you'll find that.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.580
whichever direction you look at it
from it always looks the same. It's a

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.760
Billboard that's always facing you. and you can't get around it and that's fine.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.360
That's much better for performance. but it's just a bit weird so be aware of that.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.180
Alright. so here I am back in the world. I'm in an area with no grass. right now.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.620
So. I'm going to zoom right out and just make sure there's a little bit of grass

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.970
everywhere. Now. it's going to be difficult to know where you're painting

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.250
the grass from this distance. because of
the draw distance because

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.840
it includes the Z distance. So. if you're a Y distance rather. if you're up in the air then. it's

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.669
going to include that distance. and you
won't be able to see it even from the air.

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:48.600
Let me put my character here. FPS
Controller. Game Object... Move to View. There you go.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.229
So. that was Game Object. Move to View.
and when I click Play.

00:07:52.229 --> 00:08:04.069
my guy will be. kind of stuck in the ground by the looks of it. Let's zoom out a bit. Let's lift him up and across.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:15.619
Ok. let's try him then. So. if you lose track of your game guy. of your GameObject then. just remember where the

00:08:15.619 --> 00:08:21.759
middle of your terrain is. Maybe 200 by
200 by... ah sorry. 200 by say 55

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.839
height by 200. Try that and then. let's
see where we end up in the terrain now.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:31.909
We just need to move ourselves; we'll go
find the grassy bit. So. what are the

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:36.699
coordinates of the grassy bit? Well. into
Scene View. go look at the grassy bit.

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:43.879
wherever it is. Here we are in the grassy
bit. Now. what are the coordinates

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:46.139
of where we are in the grassy bit here?

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:52.500
Well. one way to find out is you put an empty GameObject in the scene like that. and

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.410
you query to see where it is. Well. it's been created under the ground. but it's at

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.459
530 by 58. Ok. So. if I go to my FPS Controller and set it to

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:09.800
530 by 58. and then. play the game. he ends up here in the grassy bit. And he's got

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.809
that Draw Distance Limit on him. and you can see the grass

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:19.069
unfolding unfortunately but he's looking
pretty good. I think this guy might be a

00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:23.189
little bit too tall for his own good actually. that's not really helping. So. in

00:09:23.189 --> 00:09:27.290
the camera. which is attached to the FPS
Controller. instead of having a Y

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:32.680
position of the camera of 7 you could set that down to maybe 2 meters.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.280
And let's see how that looks. that's a bit better. We're a bit closer to the ground. and the impact of that draw

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.900
distance is less noticeable. So. that's how you draw trees. that's how you draw features. Go ahead and knock

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:49.040
yourself out and detail up your own terrain now. and add some detail to your terrain.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.079
Ensure it runs Ok regularly. by going
into the game view. Be subtle. think about

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:57.600
the game play. and enjoy putting
detail in your terrain. and when you're finished.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.930
we'd love to see a snapshot in the
discussions.
