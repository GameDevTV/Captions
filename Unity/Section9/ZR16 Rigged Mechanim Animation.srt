00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.099
Hey! So. we're going to look at Rigged Mechanim Animation. Now. what's that mean? We're going to

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.280
be introducing Unity's mechanim
system. it's Unity's animation system for

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.020
bipeds and humanoids and things. We'll
be exploring how Ethan is constructed

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.180
and finding the rigging and muscle tools.
within Ethan. so we can have a play

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.980
with how he moves. So. let's just take a look at Ethan over here. so click on your

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.399
zombie instance and in my case there it is. It's a little bit close to a tree for

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.290
my liking. so I'm just going to move it across and maybe down a bit. Ok. so what is this thing? I mean.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.710
we've just dropped it in this
Third Person Character Controller.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.219
it's all very well doing that. but the
problem is we don't really

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.890
understand how it works. And you may have already had the urge to modify Ethan's movement

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.230
or appearance. so we need to understand
how he works to do that. So. there is what

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.410
I call zombie 01. and let's just take a look at how this prefab has been composed.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.430
So. we have an Animator. we've seen the animator before in Glitch Garden and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.729
a Animation Controller. we may as well look at that Animation Controller. I'll probably put it

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.420
down here. which is where we've been used to seeing it. So. there's an Animation

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.280
Controller. down there. It's got some
differences. it's using something called a Blend Tree

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.189
in here. which is new to you. but
we'll look at that later in the course.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.590
So. anyway he has an Animation Controller. He also has an avatar. and it's the Avatar really

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.290
we're going to be focusing on more during
this video. So. let's do that now. while we're

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.740
here. The Avatar. if you click on it and you have your Project Pane open.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.450
it will go and find his avatar. right down in
the Third Person Character Models here.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.290
and if you expand out Ethan. we'll just click Avatar over on the Inspector. on the right.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.320
it'll go straight to Ethan's avatar. Now. fairly hidden inside Ethan's avatar is a button.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.469
saying Configure Avatar. which you may as well go ahead and click. So. try and find that. And you can save

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.939
the scene. I've moved Ethan around a bit. that's fine. And look. you've got a whole new thing here. and this

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.140
is called a Rigging Tool. so let's look what's happened when I click that configure

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.830
button. It's dropped another Ethan clone
into the scene here. on the left hand

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.819
side. just temporarily while we play with
the skeleton. and if you expand that out. you'll

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.890
see that it's comprised of a body and some glasses. We'll talk about that in a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.989
minute. but for this bit what's relevant is
the skeleton. And what Ethan consists

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.150
of is a set of bones. which are defined by a bunch of transforms. There you are you can

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.660
see the bones. And then. there's a
hierarchy of bones. from the hips.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.569
connect to the spine and the leg. You know the hip joint connects to the leg joint. and the leg

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.400
joint connects to the knee joint. I'm sure there was a kids' rhyme

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.060
about that. So. we have a hierarchy of all
his bones drilling through and it's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.750
very important they're arranged properly. And you can either click in the Inspector or on the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.670
Scene View or actually on these little
green dots. and you'll see that for the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.590
head you can click on the left hand. the
right hand. And if I had a bit more

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.550
vertical screen space. you'd see a lot
more of these bone definitions. And

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.180
what's happened here is. that when this
character was set up. all of these

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.780
transforms here define the bones. and
the outside is defined by the mesh

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.400
renderer. the skin mesh renderer. We'll look at that in a second. And this gives Unity

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.510
the ability to understand how this
humanoid character is rigged. i.e. how the bones

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.420
relate to all of these different positions.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.060
Ok. so have a look at that. and that will be
part of your challenge. will be to have a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.670
good look around at this stuff. And the
other fun thing is the Muscles Tab

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.840
here. and that puts the clone into a
different pose. And if you look at him here.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.250
you'll see he's sitting in a slightly
awkward floaty pose. and what this does

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.980
is. it allows you to define. by the moving
groups of muscles like this or by moving

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.110
individual muscles like maybe the left
leg. the range of motion. Now. because

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.260
the animations for this guy have already
been defined. it's not actually going to

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.200
change very much. depending on the state and how the animation was set up. But if you're

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.650
animating him from a start. you might very well for a zombie. for example. want

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.650
to restrict the range of motion of his
legs. and the way you do that is. you drill down into a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.780
particular muscle group. And you can
actually reduce the possible range of

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.030
motion. by changing one extreme. the
other extreme. and then. the offset by

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.699
moving the whole thing. And in fact. you can even see a little indicator here. right by his hip.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.940
which gives you some indication of how
wide a range of motion we're dealing with.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.960
So. if I was to restrict his leg motion.
right down and then. try and move it. you'll see that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.009
we can stop it moving forward at all.
Alright. so it's a pretty cool system!

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.410
It understands basically. in summary. how
the bones are connected together. right

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.630
across the body and then. how the muscle movements are restricted. Pretty cool right!

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.220
Ok. I'm going to zoom all the way back. Now. I'm going to come out of this system. by clicking Done at

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.660
the bottom right of the Inspector. Go back
to the clone and keep working down him.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.060
So. that's the avatar. and within the avatar.
we have access to that whole configure

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.389
avatar system. which is the muscle and bone system. Then. the rest of the Animator

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.330
is kind of as before. he's got a Rigidbody and a Capsule Collider. as you can see. and the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.199
Navmesh Agent. which we've been
using to have him automatically move

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.740
himself from pathfinder and the
environment. And then. it's got a couple

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.960
of scripts on it. So. that is the essence of how he is put together. Now. the other thing I

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.870
want to show you about Ethan. in this short video. is the Fundamental Top Level

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.960
Construction. So. what I just showed you
is at the root of Ethan. and then. he has

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.909
a body here. Now. if we look at that body. it has something called a Skinned Mesh Renderer. If I turn it

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.889
off it clearly disappears. Now. a Skinned Mesh Renderer is different to a normal mesh

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.849
renderer. and the reason it's different is because it automatically helps to store the mesh.

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.650
when things like arms move or any
joint moves. So. if I look at his shoulder

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.099
there and then. go to his skeleton and
drill into. all the way through the spine

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:59.750
to the neck. it's quite counter-intuitive at times. and then. all the way up to the left

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.120
shoulder. for example. and get the Rotate
Tool. Look as I rotate his shoulder. look

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.889
carefully at the textures here in his chest.

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.510
you see they kind of distort. and that's because the Skinned Mesh Renderer is doing a lot

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.159
of work for us. So. the body has a special
type of mesh renderer. Basically. if you

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:19.169
were making a robot with hinge like joints. you wouldn't use a Skinned Mesh

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.240
Renderer. you would just use a normal mesh renderer.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.699
When you're making something that has
clothing on the outside or skin on the

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.990
outside you want to use this very clever
component. which will do this type of

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.610
calculation for you. And it takes Ethan's body as a mesh. and it takes the root bone of

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.419
his skeleton. which is the hips. as
another parameter. Ok. so the other thing

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.440
it's got is a set of glasses. that's been
specified separately. that's also a

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.639
Skinned Mesh Renderer. Now. you may ask why would you want it to be a skinned

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.340
renderer for glasses? You don't have to. in this case. The benefit. of course. of it being

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.590
a skinned renderer is. if you were to expand Ethan's head out then. the glasses would

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.710
stretch with it. so they're kind of flexible
glasses. which is cool. And then. the

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.750
third object is a skeleton and you'll
notice it's just a hierarchy of transforms.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.830
as we drill down it's just transforms on here. but these transforms define the bone

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:16.270
positions. rotations. and even scales. Ok.
so that is the purpose of this hierarchy.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.060
is to completely define this guy's skeleton. which as I

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.139
said. if you go into the Mechanim System. is actually drawn for you. When. you zoom in. to the

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.400
clone that comes temporarily into the
scene. there you go. you can see he's got

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.530
an inner skeleton. Alright. now Unity can
actually what we call rig. which is

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.370
putting these bones to a skin for you.
provided that the thing that you have

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.969
created in your 3D tool is humanoid-ish and is standing in a t-pose

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:50.849
like this. But you will have had to
define all the bones as well. all

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:53.870
the positions and transforms of the bones. So. this is outside the scope of this

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.419
course. at the moment. but I just want to
show you how he's comprised so that Ethan no

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:02.580
longer is a complete mystery. We'll take a
look at his animations in a

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.540
separate video. Ok cool! Thanks for watching! I have a little challenge for you. of course as always.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.690
which is I want you to save your project.
and then. have a good play with Ethan

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.349
yourself and his rigging. And try restricting some bone movements. see if you

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:19.849
can make him a little bit more zombie
like in the muscle system perhaps. and note

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:22.800
where you get stuck. what works what
doesn't work and just have a play and

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.690
then. you can revert yourself back to
whatever you saved. So. maybe zip up. save your project.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.300
both the project and the scene. Zip up
the whole project folder perhaps.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.669
or use Version Control to take a
snapshot. Have a good play! Break things!

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.250
You'll learn most by breaking things. and note where you get stuck. maybe write down your

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.510
questions. and I'll see you soon!

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,180
what's happened here is, that when this
character was set up, all of these

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,780
transforms here define the bones, and
the outside is defined by the mesh

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,400
renderer, the skin mesh renderer. We'll look at that in a second. And this gives Unity

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,510
the ability to understand how this
humanoid character is rigged, i.e. how the bones

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,420
relate to all of these different positions.

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,060
Ok, so have a look at that, and that will be
part of your challenge, will be to have a

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,670
good look around at this stuff. And the
other fun thing is the Muscles Tab

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:39,840
here, and that puts the clone into a
different pose. And if you look at him here,

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,250
you'll see he's sitting in a slightly
awkward floaty pose, and what this does

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,980
is, it allows you to define, by the moving
groups of muscles like this or by moving

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:56,110
individual muscles like maybe the left
leg, the range of motion. Now, because

00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,260
the animations for this guy have already
been defined, it's not actually going to

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,200
change very much, depending on the state and how the animation was set up. But if you're

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,650
animating him from a start, you might very well for a zombie, for example, want

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,650
to restrict the range of motion of his
legs, and the way you do that is, you drill down into a

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,780
particular muscle group. And you can
actually reduce the possible range of

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,030
motion, by changing one extreme, the
other extreme, and then, the offset by

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,699
moving the whole thing. And in fact, you can even see a little indicator here, right by his hip,

00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,940
which gives you some indication of how
wide a range of motion we're dealing with.

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,960
So, if I was to restrict his leg motion,
right down and then, try and move it, you'll see that

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,009
we can stop it moving forward at all.
Alright, so it's a pretty cool system!

00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,410
It understands basically, in summary, how
the bones are connected together, right

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,630
across the body and then, how the muscle movements are restricted. Pretty cool right!

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,220
Ok, I'm going to zoom all the way back. Now, I'm going to come out of this system, by clicking Done at

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,660
the bottom right of the Inspector. Go back
to the clone and keep working down him.

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,060
So, that's the avatar, and within the avatar,
we have access to that whole configure

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,389
avatar system, which is the muscle and bone system. Then, the rest of the Animator

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,330
is kind of as before, he's got a Rigidbody and a Capsule Collider, as you can see, and the

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,199
Navmesh Agent, which we've been
using to have him automatically move

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,740
himself from pathfinder and the
environment. And then, it's got a couple

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,960
of scripts on it. So, that is the essence of how he is put together. Now, the other thing I

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,870
want to show you about Ethan, in this short video, is the Fundamental Top Level

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,960
Construction. So, what I just showed you
is at the root of Ethan, and then, he has

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,909
a body here. Now, if we look at that body, it has something called a Skinned Mesh Renderer. If I turn it

00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:39,889
off it clearly disappears. Now, a Skinned Mesh Renderer is different to a normal mesh

00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,849
renderer, and the reason it's different is because it automatically helps to store the mesh,

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,650
when things like arms move or any
joint moves. So, if I look at his shoulder

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,099
there and then, go to his skeleton and
drill into, all the way through the spine

00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:59,750
to the neck, it's quite counter-intuitive at times, and then, all the way up to the left

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,120
shoulder, for example, and get the Rotate
Tool. Look as I rotate his shoulder, look

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,889
carefully at the textures here in his chest,

00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,510
you see they kind of distort, and that's because the Skinned Mesh Renderer is doing a lot

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,159
of work for us. So, the body has a special
type of mesh renderer. Basically, if you

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:19,169
were making a robot with hinge like joints, you wouldn't use a Skinned Mesh

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,240
Renderer, you would just use a normal mesh renderer.

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,699
When you're making something that has
clothing on the outside or skin on the

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,990
outside you want to use this very clever
component, which will do this type of

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,610
calculation for you. And it takes Ethan's body as a mesh, and it takes the root bone of

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,419
his skeleton, which is the hips, as
another parameter. Ok, so the other thing

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,440
it's got is a set of glasses, that's been
specified separately, that's also a

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,639
Skinned Mesh Renderer. Now, you may ask why would you want it to be a skinned

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,340
renderer for glasses? You don't have to, in this case. The benefit, of course, of it being

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,590
a skinned renderer is, if you were to expand Ethan's head out then, the glasses would

00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,710
stretch with it, so they're kind of flexible
glasses, which is cool. And then, the

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,750
third object is a skeleton and you'll
notice it's just a hierarchy of transforms,

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,830
as we drill down it's just transforms on here, but these transforms define the bone

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:16,270
positions, rotations, and even scales. Ok,
so that is the purpose of this hierarchy,

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,060
is to completely define this guy's skeleton, which as I

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,139
said, if you go into the Mechanim System, is actually drawn for you. When, you zoom in, to the

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,400
clone that comes temporarily into the
scene, there you go, you can see he's got

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,530
an inner skeleton. Alright, now Unity can
actually what we call rig, which is

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,370
putting these bones to a skin for you,
provided that the thing that you have

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,969
created in your 3D tool is humanoid-ish and is standing in a t-pose

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:50,849
like this. But you will have had to
define all the bones as well, all

00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,870
the positions and transforms of the bones. So, this is outside the scope of this

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,419
course, at the moment, but I just want to
show you how he's comprised so that Ethan no

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,580
longer is a complete mystery. We'll take a
look at his animations in a

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,540
separate video. Ok cool! Thanks for watching! I have a little challenge for you, of course as always,

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,690
which is I want you to save your project,
and then, have a good play with Ethan

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,349
yourself and his rigging. And try restricting some bone movements, see if you

00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,849
can make him a little bit more zombie
like in the muscle system perhaps, and note

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,800
where you get stuck, what works what
doesn't work and just have a play and

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,690
then, you can revert yourself back to
whatever you saved. So, maybe zip up, save your project,

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,300
both the project and the scene. Zip up
the whole project folder perhaps,

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,669
or use Version Control to take a
snapshot. Have a good play! Break things!

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,250
You'll learn most by breaking things, and note where you get stuck, maybe write down your

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,510
questions, and I'll see you soon!
