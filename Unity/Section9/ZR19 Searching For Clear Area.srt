00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.980
Hey hey welcome back! So. we're going to be talking about searching for a clear area.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.540
We're going to be helping the player look
for a suitable landing place. just talk about

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.850
which type of collider we need to detect a
clear area. we'll create a simple system for

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.960
it. and I'll talk a bit more about my growing
vision for the game as a whole. So. I think

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.829
what I'm going to end up doing in this game
is. have the player in the first scene. just

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.949
be falling from the air. probably looking
up. so that it doesn't give away the size

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.160
of the terrain. and possibly. at night. I'll
decide that later. anyway the idea is. you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.850
kind of go splat. you hit the ground. it fades
to black. and then. you wake up. And when

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.800
you wake up. all your prompts are driven by
my innerVoice. So. I'm going to land on the

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.280
ground and say something like "Shit. the parachute must have not opened. Got to find a clear

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.360
flat space the size of a tennis court. to
call a HELO." or something a little more thought

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.810
out. And then. you'll go around. running aroundlooking for a sufficiently large. clear space

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.970
to land and helicopter. Now. how big a space
is that? Well. I'm a helicopter pilot myself.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.970
and I think that a tennis court is good enough.
for a small helicopter. So. something like

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:19.490
18 by 30 meters. something like that should
be enough. Call it 18 by 30 or 18 by 40. don't

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.970
mind 20 by 40 meters. We like to have a bit
of a run in. it's not very safe to be doing

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.790
vertical landings. in case you have an engine
failure. especially in a single engine helicopter.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.140
Anyway. I digress. So. what we want to do
is have some way of the player being able

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.520
to wonder around and find a clear area. So.
you can explore the different types of ways

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.270
of doing that. You can do ray casting. but
that's more complicated than we need. and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.080
you haven't seen a ray cast yet. or you would
normally just reach for a collider. Now. you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.420
may think you could use say a 2D Circle Collider.
but you can't. because you cannot prevent

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.510
a Circle Collider from being just purely in
the X Y plane. and we need something in the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.200
X Z plane. And as you look through all the
different types of colliders. you'll find

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.560
that probably the only one that works sensibly
is a Box Collider. And anyway. it's the right

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.220
kind of shape. so I'm going to put a Box Collider
on the player. or am I? Let me think about

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.650
the architecture of this. Do I want to consider
the player to have a collider and possibly

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.360
cause a bit of confusion with the character
controller's collider. or rather the... Where

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.420
is it? Yeah. the Character Controller itself
has this Capsule Collider on it. It's actually

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.410
being controlled here. you see. Even though.
if you turn it off. it doesn't stop displaying.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.840
the Character Controller comes bundled with
a Capsule Collider. So. I could put the box

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.220
collider on the player. that's find. or I
could be more explicit and create a new sub-object

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.390
of the player. called something like Clear
Area. centered on the player. Now. that could

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.870
have a Box Collider and just be a plain vanilla
thing. OK. so there it is. there is a box.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.319
Now. I said 20 by 40 meters. I think it would
be easier for the player. if the 20 meters

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.720
extended out in front of them. so if we go
40 rather in the Z and 20 let's say in the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.470
X. There you go. Now. depending on your terrain
you may need to mess around with that size

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.970
a bit. or mess around with you trees. but
that's a sort of size for me. where it won't

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.930
always fit. If I go and look from above. it's
certainly not going to fit everywhere. right.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.610
but there will be places where he can find
a clear space. So. that's pretty good for

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.140
me. OK. so there we have. on the player. this
clear area box. Now. you want its transform

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.790
to be reset. it wants to be right at the root
of the player. There it is. Now. the other

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.980
thing we want to watch out for with it is
the grass. It's because it needs to not be

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.330
colliding with the grass. It should collide
with the trees. because the trees have colliders

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.150
on them. and the way to check that of course
is to go to Terrain. Settings. and then. down

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.330
here. you'll see Enable Tree Colliders. So.
we'll see that in a minute. when we inspect

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.930
the scripts. So. what we don't have is a way
of keeping it above the grass. so why don't

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.440
we put it at 1.5 meters off the ground. Something
like that. So. there's a Box Collider. just

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.540
floating. centered on the player. and of course
remember if you go into Game and turn Gizmos

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.650
on. at the top right here. you can actually.
in the Game View. see this Box. temporarily.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.280
OK. now the player is not going to see this.
but we want to... Well. he could I suppose.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.570
but we don't really need them to. We can use
sound prompts to tell them what they need

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.750
to be doing. but it's useful maybe for the
moment. So. that's it there's the collider

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.780
that you need. We can make it a trigger. and
it should collide with the terrain. if the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.960
terrain comes up. which is good. because we
want to be landing on a flat area of ground.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.630
Other things this box will collide with. include
the zombie. here. and the trees. which is

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.040
all fine. Now. we don't actually need a zombie
at the moment. We're going to instantiate

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.490
the zombie. after we've called the helicopter.
It's tempting just to delete the zombie from

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.840
here. but don't do that. because we spend
a lot of work and time on this zombie. Various

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.290
things like the Navmesh Agent Settings. we've
spend time tweaking. if you remember. and

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.370
various other things. Now. I know it's based
on a prefab at the moment. but if you look

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.580
at that prefab. it's here in the Standard
Assets.. and I don't want it to be based on

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.600
that prefab. I want it to be based on our
own new prefab. Let me show you a couple of

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.880
new things. I'm going to create a folder.
again. and I'm going to call it Prefab. just

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.430
for now. and then. in there I want to show
you that you can actually create a prefab

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.530
inside there. And I'm going to call it Zombie.
and it's just a blank prefab placeholder.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.220
And then. you can drag your zombie from the
Hierarchy onto that Zombie Prefab placeholder.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.370
and there he is and now you have a properly
prefabbed zombie. So. now I test that by dropping

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.400
a second zombie in the scene. and if you have
a look around in Game View. we should find

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.699
that Ethan is running over there from his
normal direction but also that there is another

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.680
zombie on the way. And their possibly stuck.
I'm not sure where that second zombie is.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.639
so let's look in Scene View. He is stuck and
that is because he probably doesn't have a

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.729
target. but that's OK. we get the idea. He's
there. he's working. We could make him target

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.960
the player. and he should run off in our direction.
There we go. So the purpose of that is just

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.550
to make sure that. that prefab actually works
properly. and from somewhere we'll probably

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.020
see another zombie. running towards us. There
he is. The reason he's got a green outline

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.449
is. because we still have Gizmos turned on
in Game View. There you go. Cool. and there

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.210
he comes. OK! Fantastic! So. that prefab works.
and now we can comfortably delete both zombies

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.449
from the scene. Now. this is an edit of this
video. and previously I deleted the zombie

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.490
without thinking about that. so from now on.
for the rest of this video you won't see the

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.100
Prefabs Folder. and it'll come in. in the
next video. So. don't worry about that. and

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.229
now. I'm going to talk about my vision for
the game. What I'm going to do is have the

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:50.389
game that you land. you go: Ugh! It's night
time. you're lighting everything with a flare.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.380
You look around for a suitable landing place.
you call the helicopter by firing up a flare

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:01.990
into the air. and then. all hell breaks loose.
OK. so that's the kind of plan. So. there

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.069
it is. there's the collider. What I want you
to do now. is a little challenge. I want you

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.729
to create a landing area detector. Use the
3D Box Collider. that we just put on. wait

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:15.330
for one clear second of no collisions. Well.
their actually strictly triggers. because

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.819
it's a Trigger Collider. And then. trigger
a sound file of your own. And my sound file

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:28.180
is going to go something like: This spot should
do. Something like that. Call this spot should

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.650
do. You know. I'll do my best Duke Nukem voice.
Cool! So. pause the video. and just try and

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:40.470
get that working now. OK. welcome back! So.
how are we going to make this work. Well.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.530
we can put a script right here on the clear
area thing. and we can just call it clear

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:51.870
area. I guess. Clear Area Script. Create and
Add. Fantastic! OK. so how is the Clear Area

00:07:51.870 --> 00:08:00.150
Script going to work? Well. it's going to
need a private float. which is timeSinceLastTrigger;

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:05.680
And it may as well start off as 0. as if it's
colliding immediately. Now. what components

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.289
is this guy going to need to look for? Not
a lot. I don't think. I think it's a question

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:19.030
of going like this: void OnTriggerEnter () And
we actually don't care what it collides with.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.430
I don't think. at the moment. so we don't
necessarily need to pass... Excuse me. [Coughs]

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:30.240
We don't necessarily need to pass in any parameters
over here. So. when a trigger happens we go

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:39.239
timeSinceLastTrigger = 0) because we've just
triggered. OK. and then. on every update.

00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:47.439
we can say timeSinceLastTrigger += the frame
time Time.deltaTime; And then. again every

00:08:47.439 --> 00:08:57.129
Update. we can ask the question well. is it
time to declare that we have a suitable landing

00:08:57.129 --> 00:08:59.939
area? So. before we go any farther. let's
just make some things public and look how

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:04.889
this works. at the moment. before we get too
abstract. So. we simply have a float there.

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:09.040
That should count up. until the triggers stop.
Let's make sure that. that actually works.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.879
So. inspecting the clear area. it's been over
a second. and as soon as that collider intersepts

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:19.350
a tree there. well you see the first time
it touches a tree. it resets. but it doesn't

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.059
keep resetting. So. that's not the behavior
we want. and it's because of instead of OnTriggerEnter.

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:32.329
I want OnTriggerStay. Let's try again. So.
we start here. and the time is over a second.

00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:36.100
because we're starting in a clear area. but
now it's staying under a second until we return

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.369
to a clear area. So. I'm just going to change
the default start position of my player. to

00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:46.139
somewhere that is not a clear area. much more
in the trees. like over here and see how that

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:52.800
looks. Now. again watching the clear area
component. Oh. I do seem to be in a clear

00:09:52.800 --> 00:10:00.220
area. that was unlucky. How did I manage that?
Really! He's not in a clear area. These trees

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.209
aren't triggering. for some reason. Let me
move a little bit further out. make sure there's

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:11.179
a tree in the box. OK. so the trees that are
on me are triggering now. Oh. I have noticed.

00:10:11.179 --> 00:10:15.470
by the way. that my clear area has shifted.
Be careful what you drag. when you drag this

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.920
clear area around. Are you moving the player.
as a whole. or are you just moving its clear

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.769
area box? OK. be a little bit careful. you
want the clear area to stay centered on the

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:31.399
player. Cool! So. here we are in a clear area.
and there. we're not. So. I'm actually going

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:35.360
to make my box bigger. My clear area is clearly
not big enough. so I'm going to make it 30

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.799
meters wide by 40 meters long. It's obviously
not enough of a challenge. Here you go. So.

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:44.540
time since last trigger is staying below 1
second. and if I wonder around. and later

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.569
this will be under.. Ah. you go! You went
under a second. somewhere around here. And

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:53.329
the idea is that when you stay. in the clear
like this. for more than a second then. he

00:10:53.329 --> 00:11:04.290
goes "This should do". So. let's make that
bit work. if (timeSinceLastTrigger is greater

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:14.319
than1 float then. what are we going to do?
Well. let's put a log entry out. OK. we found

00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:19.230
a clear area. We can also play a sound clip.
so let me make sure that finding the clear

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:24.059
area works properly first. I'm looking at
the Console. wondering around. I'm going to

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:28.149
say something like "I need to find a clear
flat area to land to land a HELO." I go here.

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:32.350
and found clear area. and it keeps firing.
but that's OK. I don't think we really care

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.799
about that necessarily. We could put a boolean
flag or some sort of toggle in here. but it

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:40.999
depends what we do next. Now. we're just trying
to play a sound file. and we're done. So.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:45.509
where is the sound file going to come off?
Well. good question. Let's take a look. and

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:49.519
see if we've already got a source. We have
already got an AudioSource on the player.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:55.600
and the script is being driven by the Player
Script. So. let's go just take a look at the

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:09.220
Player Script. This doesn't currently find
his AudioSource. The AudioSource on the player

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.829
is currently being used only by the Character
Controller for the footstep sounds. So. it's

00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:18.079
still going to be a voice in our head. so
it's definitely going to come on the player.

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:23.220
So. I think that we will use the player. and
I think we need to think about the architecture.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.569
We need to think how are we going to tell
the player to think something. if he is going

00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:32.199
to have a voice in his head regularly. how
are we going to tell him to think stuff? An

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:36.739
Enum may be a good idea here. but regardless
of the solution we come up with. we've gotten

00:12:36.739 --> 00:12:39.639
to a point where we need to think a bit more
carefully about the architecture. So. I'm

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:44.850
not going to put the audio call in here. because
we know how to do it. we know that this is

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.619
being called. so we could easily put an audio
clip player in here. We need to think a little

00:12:48.619 --> 00:12:53.129
bit carefully about where these audio clips
are stored. how we keep track of all the different

00:12:53.129 --> 00:12:57.609
things the player could think and say to himself
in his head. etc. So. that will be the subject

00:12:57.609 --> 00:13:02.639
of another video. Cool! Ah. at least we've
got this far. and we have a way of finding

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:07.220
clear areas. which is pretty cool. I like
it. it's just a Box Collider around the player.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:12.569
with an OnTriggerStay. and it's high enough.
1.5 meters in my case off the ground. to not

00:13:12.569 --> 00:13:18.139
get triggered by the grass and it gets triggered
by trees and it'll also get triggered by terrain

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:23.389
that's going up. Let's just show you that
quickly. If we head off to an area that's

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:29.480
clear of trees. but go down into a dip in
the terrain. this still wouldn't be a very

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.019
good helicopter landing area. right. and our
system detects that. It's pretty cool! Look!

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:39.209
That guy is not suitable. it keeps resetting
the time since last trigger. because the collider

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:42.470
is sitting in the terrain. even tough there
are no trees around. So. pretty cool system!

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.939
Congratulations. if you came up with it yourself!
And if you've made some improvements. And

00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:49.009
And yeah. I look forward to seeing you in the
next video.
