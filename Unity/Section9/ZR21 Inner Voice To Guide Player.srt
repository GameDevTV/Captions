00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
Hey welcome back! So, we're going to use a technique called an innerVoice, to guide the

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,130
player. So, we'll be using an innerVoice to guide the player around the scene, recording some

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,740
sound prompts, and triggering sound prompts at the right time. So, let's

00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,660
start at the very beginning. Why are we here? What's going on? Well, we don't know.

00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,210
We could use a lot of UI and we've learned about UI, but how about using sound. So, if we

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,410
click Play, what happens? Well firstly, we've
got a problem, which is that for some

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,350
reason, it's ignoring the trees that are within this collider, and it's calling the

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,850
helicopter, all automatically for us, far
too quickly. So, we have quite a nice

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,110
division of responsibility, the calling
of the helicopter is handled by

00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,170
the Clear Area Script, we know that. So, in the Clear Area Script, I'm going to just add

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,460
another condition. I'm going to say that we
are going to send the found clear area

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,070
message upwards, if it's been more than a second of not colliding with any

00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,850
trees or anything, but we also want the Time.realtimeSinceStartup

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,519
which is how long the game has been running, to be greater than, say 10 seconds. And what

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,460
that will do when we play, it will just
suppress that initial helicopter call,

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,170
for at least 10 seconds, by then, the
player is likely to have moved around, and

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,990
we'll have time to play our voice
prompts. OK, so back to the scripts, so

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,960
you know what to add. It's simply adding
this bit, which is making sure with 10

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,150
seconds have passed, you can choose a
different value of course. OK fine!

00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,670
So, what I want to do, is at the very beginning of the game, I want to set

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,430
the scene a little bit. Now, you might want to make a fade up, you know a visual fade up.

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,770
There's lots of ways of doing that, there's lots of fancy things you can do, but I just

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,090
want to crack on and get the important
bits done for you. So, the player

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,280
itself is going to need access to various
different sound files. So, I'm going to make a little

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,780
section here for sound files, and let's have explicitly just write each one out. We could use

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,030
arrays, we could not even connect them to
the player, we could just find them based

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,250
on their name inside the assets, but I'm
just going to, for each one, just say I have an

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:05,740
AudioClip, and I'm going to have the first one as just, whatHappened; audio public AudioClip

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,300
whatHappened, which of course means that the player, when we look at his script

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,819
or her script, is going to be asking for a whatHappened.

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,989
OK, so let's go record what happened, just
for fun. Now, have some fun yourself, record

00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,290
yourself an audio script for setting the scene, but I'm just going to make a fool of

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,680
myself now, by recording something in
a voice far deeper than I'm qualified to use.

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,840
And I'm just going to record something daft. So, have a few goes and see how it goes.

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,530
[He Says in a Character's Deep Voice] Ah, what the hell happened! I better call for some help!

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,459
Got to find an area about the size of a
tennis court and call a HELO! I think that sounds really stupid. Let's try it!

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,440
[The Recording Plays] Ah, what the hell happened! I better call for some help!

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,830
Got to find an area about the size of a
tennis court and call a HELO! [Ben Starts Talking] OK, well that'll do. So, I'm

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,049
just going to trim the sound there, and then, export the selection here in Audacity.

00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,010
You can use your favorite sound program, or you can use Audacity as well, and I'm

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,430
just going to call this what happened.

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,930
And I'm going to save it as an .ogg file, because it's compatible with a lot of different

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,100
formats, a lot of different platforms,
should I say target platforms. Cool! So, there

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,160
it goes what happened? And of course, I'm going to put that in your start pack for

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,480
you, so by the time you watch this video,
we will have an Audio Folder inside your start pack.

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,780
So, here we go, audio and very simply just add it. Simple stuff right, but needs doing and no point in me

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,160
skipping over it. What happened? Here We go, boom! So, when is that going to play? Well that may as

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,480
well play, at the beginning. Now, be careful with these sound units on the player.

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
The player already has an AudioSource, but if we play the game and look at

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,320
that AudioSource, you'll notice it does
things like jump and footsteps.

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,760
That AudioSource is being handled or being used by the character controller,

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,760
first-person character controller, and
it's using these jump and land and other

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,389
sounds. So, we're going to need a new AudioSource. There's other ways of doing this, but

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,359
one of the easiest ways is just to add a
new AudioSource, to the player, and think

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:07,280
about whether it's 2D or 3D. Well, I think
it's 2D, because it's his innerVoice. OK, and

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,040
it doesn't currently have an AudioClip,
of any sort. We're going to pass audio clips into it.

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,989
So, the question of which AudioSource we
would grab, should we try and use this

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,190
second AudioSource, is quite an
interesting one, because

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,430
the first person controller, rather script here, already does the following

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,949
in the Start, it goes and finds a component of type AudioSource, but this

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:38,389
is kind of assuming there's just one. And
if we had a second AudioSource, which we

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,880
want to do, because we want footsteps to
play, as well as the innerVoice, then

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,759
how's this going to know which one to grab? How do we know that this is going to

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,240
address the correct AudioSource? Well, we don't, at the moment, so if you're going to use

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,310
off the shelf scripts, like this, it's fine,
and it brings you a lot of power, but the

00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,639
dark side is, you sometimes need to
modify them. So, let's go ahead and do

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,740
that, let's change the First Person
Controller Script, for a start, so that we

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,259
can make sure that it grabs the right
AudioSource. Now, how do we

00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,860
differentiate them? Well, let's take a
look at them. I would like them to be next

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,710
to each other, so I can move this
component up or not. It's going to lose the

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,710
prefab connection. Let me just look at
something. Look at your player, right click on

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,320
your player and look at the prefab. Where is it? It's still in the Standard  Asset,

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,520
you can see we've never prefabbed the player, all we've done is updated an existing FPS

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,199
Controller prefab. Not a particularly good
idea. Now, I think it's a good time to

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
make our own prefab of the player, so
drag your player down into your Prefabs Folder.

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,389
Now, you have this player, if you select Prefab, connected over here. That's fine, then you

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,090
will find that you should be able to move
your audio sources together, so a side

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,729
effect of just trying to move that up, was
realizing that the prefab is not

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:57,560
properly stored. OK, so now we have two
audio sources, on this player. How are we going to

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,930
distinguish between them? Well, let's use
the priority, the default priority here

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,430
is 128, for the one that came on
the prefab, for the footsteps. We'll leave

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,949
it at that, and then, we will put a much
higher priority, let's call it one, on the

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,289
innerVoice. The innerVoice AudioSource is really important. Now, we can't

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,449
label it any other way, but we could set
a priority of 1. So, now we have two audio

00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:25,580
sources, one is a 3D AudioSource, making
the footsteps, and other players will be able to hear that,

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,159
and the second one is a 2D AudioSource, that only we hear, that is for the innerVoice.

00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:36,090
We haven't arranged that only we hear it,
but there's only one player, so who cares

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,430
right. So, what the scripts are going to do is find all the AudioSource

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,879
components and then, use the priority to
distinguish between them. This is just one of many

00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,669
different ways of doing it. Let's start by doing this, with the First Person

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,150
Controller Script, and then, I'll ask you to do it for the player. So, instead of going

00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:01,360
GetComponent source, what we want to do is, we want to say temporarily, let's

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:11,940
have our self an AudioSource array, audio
sources, here in the First Person Controller.cs,

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:22,580
and that = GetComponents, that's with an S, of type AudioSource. OK, and

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,250
then... Oops, I'll get my brackets around the right way. So, there has returned to me an array of audio

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:36,690
sources, and then, we want to say foreach (AudioSource

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:49,770
I'm thinking of type AudioSource, so it is a capital, in audioSources), which is an array.

00:07:49,770 --> 00:08:02,340
If audioSource... here you go, get the syntax right. So, for each audioSource variable, of type

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:14,360
AudioSource, in the audioSources array, if (audioSource.priority == 128)

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:23,600
then, we do this m_AudioSource = audioSource;

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,140
otherwise, we just simply do nothing. So, let's firstly check

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,180
that, that works. What this should be doing... You're allowed to convert the type in here, when

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,860
you build this. What this should be doing
is, still working just fine. We should be able to

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:42,110
hear our foot steps, and we can and that's fine. Let's inspect the player, have a little

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,870
look at his setup, and we have an AudioSource there, the top one there,

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,300
the Footstep 01 Footstep 02, toggling away, and our other audio sources doing absolutely

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,209
nothing at the moment. That's great! So, now what I want you to do is, I want you to

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:04,290
apply a similar idea across to the
players. So, in the Player Script, we

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,260
started thinking about the idea of
having an AudioSource. We have an AudioClip,

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,020
but what we haven't done yet is
determine the right AudioSource. So, what I want you to

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:22,720
do is go private AudioSource InnnerVoice; And then, in the Start, I want you to write a bit of code

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,690
that finds the correct AudioSource for
the innerVoice.

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,840
So, go ahead pause the video, and go and find the correct or innerVoice AudioSource,

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:40,640
right now. OK welcome back! So, I'm going to use the code that we had over here. You're allowed to copy and

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,930
paste code once, do it too many times, you'll want to start making separate methods. So, I think it's

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,050
that. We have an array of audio sources,
we go and get all of them, we see if the

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,770
priority is 1 and if that is, then the innerVoice becomes the AudioSource. Fantastic!

00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,880
So, when we start the game, when the player

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:15,930
first starts, we want to be saying that
the innerVoice.clip = whatHappened;

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,600
And then, we want to do innerVoice.Play ();

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,700
as a method. OK, let's go make sure
whatHappened is connected up to the

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,630
player. I think it is, but let's see. It doesn't
go in here, it does not go in the clip,

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,850
that gets set up, run time. It goes down in What Happened here, so What Happened.

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,600
Let's select What Happened in the resulting dialogue, and let's see what happens, at

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,260
the very beginning. [Game Character Talks] Ah, what the hell happened! I better call for some help! I've got to

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:53,200
find an area about the size of a tennis court and call a HELO! [Ben Starts Talking] That's cool! Now, if we look at... I don't know whether it's cool,

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,080
but it's something. And now, he's found a clear area, and the helicopter comes in.

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:06,260
Fantastic! So, you can see that, that is a
way of having two different AudioSources

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,660
on the player and then distinguishing them by their priority.

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,820
We do want a higher priority on the innerVoice anyway. So, now we know what we need

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:24,800
to be doing, when the game starts this...[Game Character Talks in Background]

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,960
[Ben Start Talking] Now, I'm not finding these tree colliders particularly reliable, but when we get there,

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,790
the rescue helicopter gets called. Now, you may want to polish this a bit, you

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,400
you may want to give some affordance to the player, say something like, I better hang

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,440
around here and deploy a flare, or you might want to have a countdown or even

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,530
make them push a button to call the
helicopter. Mine is just calling the

00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,270
helicopter immediately, when we get to

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,020
a clear area, but that's fine. So, that is how you deal with multiple AudioSources, or

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,920
one way of doing it, and then, shortley we'll be looking at the question of how

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,020
we arranged for the helicopter to
actually land, at the place that we have found.
