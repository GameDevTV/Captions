00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460
Welcome back! In this video. we're going to be creating a terrain. So. we'll first

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.530
have you go and read the game design document. Then. I'll show you how to set up a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.219
terrain. talk you through some settings.
and then. make your own. So. go read

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.650
the GDD first. you'll get a feel for where
we're headed. Write down your own ideas

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.460
about what you want to do in this game.
and then. share your ideas in the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.280
discussion. So. pause the video. go find the
game design document. which is at the beginning of the

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.300
section. take a look come up with some ideas of your own that you want to include.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.070
challenge yourself. and see you in a
second. So. over in Unity I have a blank

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.600
Zombie Runner project here. with
absolutely nothing going on. So. the first

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.350
thing to do is create a 3D object.
terrain. Fantastic! There it is. a big white

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.870
blob in your scene. There it is in the
hierarchy. and there it is in your assets.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.109
So. that's absolutely wicked! So. when we
first set this terrain up. firstly.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.800
there's not really enough space to work
with it in my windows here. so I'm going to

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.580
remove a few panes. You're welcome to do
the same if you like. I'm going to get rid of

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.870
the project. the console. and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.740
the hierarchy. and then. save this
layout. which is in a slightly different

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:21.000
place in Unity 5.1. I'm going to save it as Terrain. Terrain Editing. there you go. or just terrain.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.840
whatever. So. there you've got a much bigger layout. so I can see what I'm doing.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.880
Now. the way I'm moving around this terrain. in case you haven't noticed Fly

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.200
Through Mode is as follows. you go into
the Scene View. right click the mouse

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.350
button or hold down both fingers on a Mac
Trackpad. and then. you can use A to go

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.480
left D to go right. Standard first person
controls. In fact. you can see it in the

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.090
middle of screen there. it's indicating with the little icon next to the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.690
eye. And then. W goes forward S goes
backwards. and then. E and Q go up and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.740
down. if you're lucky. And then. Shift makes everything go faster. Sometimes you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.650
might find the E and Q. I'm finding that
it sometimes is acting on my terrain

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.190
settings over here. But generally. your Fly
Through Mode is a fairly reliable way of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.910
moving around. in the game mode. while you're holding down the right mouse button. Cool! So. I've

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.870
accidentally tweaked the terrain there. It
doesn't matter if you do that. we can

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.830
always replace and fix the terrain later.
So. first thing is to decide on how big a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.610
terrain you're going to want. This one is
500 by 500 World Units. and you can

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.750
see that by going into the Inspector. clicking on the little cog on the right hand

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.120
side. under Terrain where I'm pointing
now. and then. scrolling down to where it says

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.989
Resolution. Terrain Width. Terrain Length; it's 500 by 500 meters. When I've called for at least

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.970
600 by 600 and I've chosen that size.
because it's not much bigger than the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.540
default. And yet. at normal running speed
of one of our characters it gives us a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.160
whole minute of movement across this
terrain. if we were to get down there and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.580
have a character controller. which you'll
meet later. run across this terrain. it would take

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.050
about a minute to get across.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.870
Now. if you have a very fast machine or lots of memory. so more than say

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.400
8 gig of RAM and a pretty fast
machine. a quad-core or beyond then. you

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.350
might want to go up on this terrain size.
If you have a particularly slow machine.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.209
you may want to go down. because you'll notice with terrain already. you see it's doing stuff in the

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.349
background. now. It's doing various
things that we don't need to worry about at the moment.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.640
It's doing some clustering. invisibility

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.590
calculations. This is basically to do with
how Unity is going to reveal the terrain

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.400
to us. as we move across. It doesn't look
much like a terrain at the moment. it's rather boring

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.209
right. It's just a flat space. but pick
yourself a size. and that is something

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.060
that you do need to get right now.
because if you draw features on this

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.350
terrain. and then. you resize the terrain later. then everything will get stretched.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.440
And it doesn't have to be square by the
way; it doesn't have to be 600 by 600. I'm just going

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.440
to go with a simple 600 by 600 to save
myself work. but if you want a more

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.890
adventurous world and you like to think
you're going to like creating worlds. feel free

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.709
to make this big... bigger. So. the first thing we're going to want to do is put some sort of

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.340
texture to this terrain. This plain white
is just. too. boring. So. click the middle

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.300
setting. for the moment. which is the
Paint Texture setting. and we're going to

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.930
need to go and get ourselves a texture.
Now. the place to get that is from the Asset

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.850
Packs. You want the Environment Asset Pack. so go to Assets. Import Package Environment.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.390
Now. if for any reason you don't have that
Environment Asset Pack. you're going to need

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.400
to go and get it from the Unity store.
but you probably checked it when you

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.500
installed Unity. so you probably have
this pack. Import Package Environment.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.960
So. it's going to decompress the package. pop up with a dialogue something like this.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.840
I think we may as well take the whole lot.
If you do want to save some space.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.660
on your project then. you could look a bit
more critically at this. and say well what do I

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.090
want? Do I need Cross-Platform Input? Not really. Do I need Environment? Yes. it's

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.780
all about environment. Do I need utility
stuff? No. not really at the moment. So. you

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.790
could if you wish. just take actually the
Environment Section by expanding out

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.600
your windows like this and just taking
environment. I'm going to do that. because

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.990
it's going to be smaller and quicker. But
again. if you're not worried about size

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.330
just import the whole lot. So. here we go!
It's bringing in some Standard Assets.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.669
which are going to be really handy for getting a basic bit of terrain off the ground. So. let that happen.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.970
You might be wondering what these other
things on here are. while we wait. These are

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.130
brushes. they're just different shapes with.
which you can paint on the canvas of your

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.680
terrains. And then. you've got a brush size.
which is that blue blur you see there.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.200
That tells you how big a brush you're using.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.510
and so that varies how large your
brushes are. And then. the opacity here tells

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.520
you how quickly you paint. so that tells
you if it's very high then. you

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.690
immediately go to fully opaque terrain textures.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.310
And if it's very low then. you have to put a very transparent texture on. until you

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.440
go over the space lots of times. we'll see
that in a bit. And I'll talk about the difference

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.200
between opacity and target strength. but now that my import has imported. lets add a texture.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.560
Now. you get two options. several options actually. You have the Tile Size of the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.010
textures and the Default. if you're using your own terrains. Let's leave

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.460
that as default. Then. you have the option
for an Albedo and a Normal Map. so we're

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.610
going to go for the Albedo. And let's
look for something like grass. Grass Hill

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.880
Albedo. for example there. Ok! So. there we are. we have an Albedo Darkness

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.750
tile. And if we add that to our list then.
it's the first texture in our list of

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.930
brushes. and it automatically applies that to the entire terrain. So. if you

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.770
come down and then. have a little look
around... I'm just going to zoom in. It looks incredibly

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.630
tiled. but when you get up close it kind of
looks ok. It looks a bit repetitive.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.480
But we're going to break this up a lot. But at
least we have a terrain we can see

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.860
better than the plain boring terrain.
that we had before. So. that is how you

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.650
get the base texture on there. You can add as many layers of textures as you want. so

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.110
if you then go back in here. and then
look down. you've got... a lot of these to

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.910
do with trees and stuff. but the other
thing you've got is Grass Rocky Albedo.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:15.040
So. let's have some of that and add that to
the list. and let's also add the mud one. Ok.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.879
Now. with the mud. you also notice if you put mud in the search. that you get a

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.499
Normal Map available. as well. So. let's do
that. let's select the Muddy Albedo.

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:29.019
but let's also select a Muddy Normal Map.
Now. let's see what that does briefly.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.439
So. say you were to click over on this mud texture. because it's loaded with not

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:36.869
only a texture but a Normal Map. look
what happens when I make something muddy.

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:44.379
I choose Mud. by clicking on it there. I then. pick myself a brush. and I'll make

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:50.159
the size of it smaller. like this. so it's
reasonable. Now. the Opacity tells you how opaque

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.979
the texture that you paint actually
is. but it tells you how quickly it puts

00:07:54.979 --> 00:08:00.169
the paint down. So. if I have a very low
Opacity then. it puts the paint down very

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:04.839
slowly. and I have to keep going over the
same area again and again. If I have a very

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:08.849
high Opacity. it immediately goes to
the Target Strength. and the Target

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:12.599
Strength tells you how transparent the texture is when you've

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:15.759
finished. So look. if I put a target strength
of 1 and an Opacity of 100. it

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:20.360
immediately goes to 100% mud. Wheres if I had a low Opacity and a high

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.200
Target Strength... And what it would do is
it would eventually go to

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.760
100% mud. if I rub in enough. So. I
actually like having a bit of a low

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:32.229
Opacity. it gives a more natural feel. and then. you can kind of brush on your muddy

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:35.930
areas. like this. Now. the mud will look
different to other stuff. a little bit.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.430
Because it has a Normal Map. it may. to
your eye. look a little bit 3D. and

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.029
that's the purpose of a Normal Map. We
won't go into the details. right now. but

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:47.940
it should give it a kind of 3D look. Let's see  by turning off the

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:54.060
Normal Map. for a moment. There you go. look at the mud. now. it looks very flat. Now. go back

00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:05.460
to the texture. and add the Normal Map. Can you see the difference? Let me move this out of the way.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.660
I can. it makes it look really much more 3D.
While you're here. you could search the

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.450
Standard Asset Pack for normal. see whatever Normal Maps you have. but you'll find that for

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:19.560
ground stuff. rather than trees use only
the mud. Ok. So. just give it a more 3D effect.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.050
So. that is how you paint your textures
on the land.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.460
The other thing I want to show you.
before I let you loose creating your own

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.970
land is how to raise and lower the
terrain. So. bear in mind that. right now.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.710
the terrain is the lowest height it can
get. So. if you try and hold down Shift

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:40.730
and click. you cannot lower the terrain.
but you can raise it. Ok and you have a

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.070
similar kind of setting here. with Opacity and brush size. So. you can raise

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.160
up the terrain where you want your hills. Now. if you want the whole terrain up. so

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.700
that you can dig valleys. and I do
suggest that you do this so that you

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.550
can actually dig down a little bit.
this is how you do it. You use the next

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:01.210
setting along. which is Paint Height. Now. what Paint Height lets you do. is say you

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.890
put in a target height of 50 and a very
high Opacity in a big brush. Then. you

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.660
paint and then. it stops; It caps it at
50. So. you could paint the whole texture like

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:15.420
this. or you could just say flatten to 50. and I actually think that 50 is probably a good place to be.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.310
That means we can make holes that are up to 50 meters deep. That's pretty caverness. but

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:24.240
that's fine. So. I'm going to suggest that
you go to Paint Height. choose a height of 50 and

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.920
flatten your terrain. And that's just
going to determine how deep you can dig

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.920
into the terrain. when you go to the
Raise Lower Button and hold down Shift.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.260
You're going to able to create cavities that are up to 50 meters deep.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.340
Ok so. creating the shape and then
texturing kind of go hand-in-hand.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.400
So. imagine I've textured this bit here.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.630
What would I want? Well. the standard
thing would be. you'd kind of grab

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:51.460
yourself a rocky texture for the edges
here. Now. that brush is too big. and the

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.500
Opacity is so the Target Strength is too
high and the Opacity is too high. So. I

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.270
could start brushing a rocky texture
onto the sides of a hill like this. to

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.740
give it more of a kind of. more of a
rocky feel. You see. I'm doing is really

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.840
rough for now. because I'm going to challenge you to make your own terrain. in a minute.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.540
And then. what you might want to do in your depressions. not your depression.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:19.450
is to paint some mud. maybe in the bottom
of your dips. Yes. and maybe a rocky surface

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.320
on the vertical surfaces and some mud in
the bottom. If you've still got remnants of

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.680
something like that. and you can't get rid of
it. that's because you need a Target Strength

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.440
of 1. so that you completely overwrite any
underlying textures.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.940
They're all slightly opaque unless you have a Target Strength of 1. The other thing of course you can do is.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.440
make yourself some mountains. So. I
suggest you do that and that's that.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.720
Now. what I would like you to do is make
hills all the way around the outside. Now. the

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.740
reason being is that when you're down on the ground. one of the tricks that

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.600
games use. so that you can't tell that
there's an edge to the world is that

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.560
they raise up the ages of all the world. Let me just do this over here. for

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.930
a second. And you just need to do it enough that when you're down at eye height.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:06.360
which is about two meters off the ground. that you can't any longer see the end

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.130
of the game world. So. this is really
rough. just to show you the idea. If I had

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.250
hills all the way along there... you want them all the way around the outside of your terrain.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:19.350
And look what happens when I get down to eye height. Watch the edge of the world and the

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.820
horizon there. See if you've got
sufficient height. You can't see the edge

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.310
of the world. it looks like it's going on
forever. now. Yeah. especially if you've got

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.140
terrain up here and over here.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.500
Cool hey! So. what I want you to do is to
create your own to terrain. Now. remember in

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.300
the GDD you know what's going on. you want to be able to run away from

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.160
these zombies. You can't have overhangs.
remember. that's one of the limitations of

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.540
Unity's Terrain system. is that it's
impossible to make something above

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.240
something else. It's a pure height map.
every part of this is just at a particular

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.910
height. but go ahead and make yourself
your own terrain focusing on raising and

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.720
lowering. flattening if necessary.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.380
Smooth Height. if you're wondering. just
smooths things out if they're looking too jagged.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:06.580
And then. use this paint texture to paint on
some broccoli texture. which remember you load

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.320
through edit textures. And some mud. maybe in the bottom of your pits and just randomly

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:16.740
where you want it and just standard
grass in other places. So. if I want to

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:22.630
get rid of this nasty patch here. I go 100%
grassy texture. and you see I can tidy up.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.950
Ok. so that's your challenge! Make this
terrain your own. make it interesting!

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.000
It doesn't really matter how it is. just
make sure it's got some dips and some

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.200
various hills and things like that. Remember. you're going to have zombies

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.270
running at you from all different places. We
want places for them to spawn. We want places

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.860
for you to spawn. We want places for the
helicopter to be able to land. So. go ahead

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.400
and set up your own terrain. and have a
lot of fun with it now. using these

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.850
first four terrain tools. that you've
just learnt about. There's your challenge slide.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.740
Fantastic! How did you get on with your
terrain? What were your challenges? I would

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.030
really like you now to zoom out of your terrain. Once you've made it to this stage.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:09.560
even if it's the most basic terrain. then
take a screenshot. and save that

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.560
screenshot and put it over in the
discussions for us. That would be

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.410
fantastic if you could do that. If you
don't know how to save your screen shot.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.090
well. there's lots of programs to do that. Most systems. Mac and PC. allow you to do it

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:25.240
built into the system. or you can use a
fantastic system like Snag It here or

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.520
one of many other free tools. But let's
get you saving your screenshot and

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.500
sticking it in the discussion. so that we
can see the shape of your terrain.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.160
So. it should just be shaped and basically
textured. We'll worry about trees and

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.770
other features a little bit later. and I
shall do my terrain in the next video.
