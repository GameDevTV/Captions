00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,050
I am so excited about this zombie game that I need to put a dampener on it! This is

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,099
like the game developers equivalent of a
cold shower! So, just before we dive in,

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,570
I am going to read the Unity 5.1 Change
Log, so we're going to be talking about unity 5.1

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,830
features in this video. So, what I want to
do is make sure you have unity 5.1 or

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,740
later installed, briefly talk about
what was new in Unity 5.1, and why we're

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,540
using it in this section. So, let's just
take a little look. This is also a bit of

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,590
a lesson in how to read change logs. So, here we go. This is Unity telling us about what's in

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,140
a later version. Every time a new version
of Unity comes out, I think it's worth

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,560
you taking a quick look at the release
notes. This is how I read release notes.

00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,300
I flick over them first.

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,250
Literally overview first, and general
process of overview, in view, review is

00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,489
a good idea. Bear in mind, when you overview like this, your brain is going to pick out

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,829
the big things like the graphics far more
readily than that awkward little line in there

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,610
somewhere, that makes a massive
difference to your projects. So, know

00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,560
that when you do an overview you are
getting a very biased overview of what

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,930
you're looking at, because it's going to be
weighted by the graphical and hence

00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,710
informational density. And then, I do a
in view, so overview, in view, review.

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,720
So then, I look through and see what's
the general point. So, there's a multiplayer

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,409
networking feature! Fantastic! We'll use
that! That saves us from using services

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,040
like pars, hopefully, if it works well? Pars is fantastic, it does let you create

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,640
online scoreboards and cloud-based data
sharing, but let's give Unity's Multiplayer

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,000
Networking System a go, if it will
support what we need it to do. So, some

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,040
new network components, some improvements to the Oculus Rift, although still haven't got

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,680
support for the Mac at the time of
recording. A new HDR color picker. That's cool,

00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:03,220
High Dynamic Range! So, some new stuff to do with text compression, and other stuff

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,970
like that. So there are Community Analytics improvements here, so once your game is

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,430
out there, you're going to be able to,
provided your users allow you to, track some

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,170
more interesting things. which is
going to be great. You'll notice that

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,750
when you start Unity 5.1 a couple of
things happen, and number one, it's

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,700
obviously talking to the server. You
can see that bar going across the top

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,239
there. It still will work offline, I'm
confident of that. In fact, let me show

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,090
you what the experience is if we are offline. I'm just going quit Unity.

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,920
I'm going to callously pull out my network
cable, you can't see that I've done that,

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,780
but I have done that. And then, I'm going
to reopen Unity now, and this will fail

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,470
to talk to the server and it'll say
work offline. So, there's a difference.

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,820
That's fine but just note that it's
different. I'm plugged back in. The other

00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,260
thing you'll notice when you try and open a previous project, even though you're

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,550
previous project may have been in a
previous version of Unity 5, it

00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,550
will still want to do a rebuild, which. is going to take a few minutes or a few seconds

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,840
depending on the size of your project. So, take a back up before that. Of course, this

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,269
project, Zombie Runner, has absolutely nothing in it. I just have an empty project.

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,760
So, there's that. It's always worth
reading the backwards compatibility

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,280
breaking changes, so there are a few
changes to the Animator. You'll see more

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,280
of that later, so if you're upgrading a
previous project, particularly say Glitch

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,230
Garden, you may well find you need to
make some minor tweaks to the animations,

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,630
to make them work. We haven't been using Hinge Joints, Motor Springs, et cetera, yet, so

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,690
this stuff shouldn't hurt you too much. Stuff under the physics and the Xbox One is irrelevant,

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,860
right now. Then, you can just look at say
the changes in general, lots of stuff to

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,020
the Animator, GI so on so on so on. Ok, cool!

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,200
Some improvements! Now, there's one improvement that caught my eye and its for the reason I

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,170
mentioned earlier, it's a big graphic
amongst a load of text, but it is

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,880
actually useful. You can now add motion
constraints to 2D rigid bodies. What does that mean?

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,120
Well, in something like Block Breaker, previously it would have been a pain to make the paddles stay in

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,069
a fixed Y position without jeopardizing the physics of the paddle. Now, if you wanted the paddle

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:10,109
to stay in a fixed Y position but to be
free, otherwise as a rigid body, you could

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:14,569
click this fixed Y position button, which is a new constraint. It has always been there for 3D

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,690
objects, but now, it's available for 2D.
That just caught my eye.

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,360
If you want to go back and play with the implications of that for Block Breaker...

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,889
Umm, lots of fixes. It's worth reading if you've got something you know is broken or if you've been

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,469
waiting for a fix. And some known issues.
It's always worth an eye over the known issues, as well.

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:38,120
Ok! So, that's it really. That's what is in
Unity 5.1. Why are we upgrading to Unity 5.1 now?

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,020
Just because it's the latest version, and we always like to use the latest and

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,370
greatest stuff. We may use its networking
features later in this project, but for

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,520
now, that's it. What I want you to do is
create yourself a new Unity project. You

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,300
know how to do that, by now. Call it Zombie Runner, and then, we're in the

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,770
same place and on the same page; we just have a completely blank Unity project. We're ready to

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,590
roll up our sleeves and create something
brand new and fresh.

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,320
So, I look forward to working with you.
