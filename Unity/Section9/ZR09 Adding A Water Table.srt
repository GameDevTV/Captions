00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940
Hey hey. welcome back! So. we're going to be adding a water table. and you are in for a treat.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.750
because Unity 5 comes with beautiful water shaders built in. for free now! So. let's

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.980
take a look! We're going to be using Unity 5's wonderful water prefab to create a water

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.680
table in your terrain. Water table
meaning a height in the terrain below

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.240
which there is water. although you'll see
that it's just a surface. but let's take

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.949
a look. Dig down to create some water hazards. paint some mud under the water

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.530
surface even. and previewing the water from the ground. So. let's dive

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.469
into Unity and take a look at this. Under your Standard Assets under Environment.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.030
if you've imported the package. which I
hope you have by now. you should

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.330
have Water and Water Basic. Go for Water Water. that's the folder we're looking for.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.240
Standard Assets. Environment. Water. Water. and get a prefab. and we're going to go for

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.340
WaterProDaytime. I think for now. They look very similar. by the way. If you drag

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.330
that WaterProDaytime into the scene
and double click it. you'll see that it's

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.470
made a little circle. but it'll have made a
circle in completely the wrong place.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.490
So. how high do we want this. for a start? Well. maybe 5 meters below our ground.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.610
so in my case that's at 45. So. that's looking a little bit better. Now. we need to move it

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.680
into the middle of the terrain. So.
remember you can click the Y arrow to

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.439
look at the world from above. and then.
move it roughly to the middle of your

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.040
terrain. Look at your settings. remind
yourself how big your terrain is. if

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.290
necessary go to Terrain Settings 600 by
600. Ok. So. your water. and I'm just going to call

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.090
it Water Table. should be at 300 by 45 by
300. in my case. And if we use

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.960
the Transform Tool. we can confirm there
that it is right in the middle of the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.960
terrain. Cool! So. the problem with it now is it's too small. So. what size does it need to be?

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.939
Well. if we want it to go out to these corners over here then. it's

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.500
going to need to have a radius of at
least 300. so 300 by 300.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.420
I'm sorry. the Y direction doesn't matter. because it's just a flat circle. but 300 is going

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.270
to get to the edge here but it's not
going to get to the edges here. So. let's

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.570
do a little calculation. How are we going to find out how big it needs to be to

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.060
go to the edge? Well. it's going to be the
square root of 2. isn't it. If you're any good at

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.840
math. you'll know that it's going to be
the square root of 2. which is 1.4

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:42.540
times the 300. So. 425 will do. If we make a scale 425. in both directions.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.350
X and Z.  Boom! Now. we have a water
table that is just as big as our terrain.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.000
It just about touches the edges of the
terrain. and wherever the terrain is lower

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.930
than that. it will intercept the water
table. So. let's go right down to the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.790
FPS Controller and have a quick look
around. to start with.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.880
Now. if you've got any low-lying areas. like this big hole I'm heading over towards at breakneck speed

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.700
over here. then. you're going to be in for a treat in a minute. because we're going to get Unity 5's wonderful

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.240
water shader in our face. Look at that! And without even making any changes to the settings. it's already not looking half bad.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.640
Look at that! How cool is that? And you can look back at the Sun and have lots of fun. Now. we're going to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.880
improve the lighting. we're going to do all sorts of things. but I just wanted to show you how nice the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.160
water shader actually is in here. So. what that's done is it's put a water circle underneath the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.120
entire terrain. at a fixed height. Now.
anywhere that you decide to go and drop

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.230
the height of the terrain. now the water
will appear. which is what I meant by a

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.670
water table. So. you might want to create
some water hazards. some water areas. where

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.010
your zombies are going to attack you.
and you don't want them to get across the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.370
water. So. as you drop the terrain. it will
automatically now create water

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.840
effectively. You're going to end up with some trees. So. remember you go to trees. and you hold

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.190
down Shift and you just delete trees
like that. Ok. And then. your FPS controller you may

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.400
want to move across into say the middle.
Where is the middle? 300 by 300.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.760
Let's see where we end up. probably in
the water. Now. we're stuck underwater. Now. when

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.460
you're underwater. it doesn't look like you're under water. because it's just not how the renderer

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.310
works. And later on. we're going to put some colliders in. so that if we actually end

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.990
up in the water we die. but in the meanwhile. I just want to show you how cool this looks. hey. Really coming

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.320
together nicely. Now. there are some settings on your Water Table Prefab. let's look at it. It has a Water Plane Mesh.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.949
which is slightly different to a Normal Mesh. It has some materials here. it also has a

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.880
Water Script. and you can choose whether
it's Reflective. Refractive.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.840
or Simple. So. if you go reflective then. it only reflects off the surface.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.400
I kind of prefer that actually. and I'm
probably going to leave mine reflective.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.540
But if you do want to better see under the
surface. you can make refractive water. which is

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.800
even more complicated. Now. that will
reflect off the surface. but it will also

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.370
show into the water. It's up to you which one of those two you use. I've never seen water quite

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.440
this clear. so I think I'm going to just
go with reflective. The other benefit of

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.760
going with reflective is. if you're with
refractive then. you have to start going

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.660
in and painting under the water.
otherwise it looks silly. So. if we go to

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.100
this area here. it looks silly for there to be grass growing under the water.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.300
You could of course go to your terrain. your Paint Tool. get your muddy widget here.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.460
Maybe a smaller brush. and you could paint mud under the water surface. diligently in

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.479
all of your ponds. Now. if you've got the
patience for that. well then I commend you.

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:57.679
and that would be great and it would look a lot better. But if you look in there. it's still ridiculously clear water

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.780
isn't it? So. unless you've got a setting in the water for how clear the water is. I would suggest

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.210
you just go Reflective water. It's entirely up to you.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.930
Alright and then. you can choose various other things. which I don't think

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.250
we need to be messing around with now.
You've also got some options under

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.490
WaterProDaytime here. which we can look at. but It's best off if we can see the game view.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:26.020
So. I'm going to unmaximize on play. click play. go to the water's edge like so. Now. I can mess

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.930
around with the Water Scale. and that changes the Wave Scale of the water. In fact. I recommend

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.509
a slightly lower Wave Scale. So remember. if you make these changes in

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.699
Play Mode it's going to forget them when
you get out. And unfortunately. being a

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.940
shader you can't copy these things. so you're just going to need to remember them. So you've

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.320
got your reflection distortion here.
which is changing how much it's distorting

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.690
those trees. You see. if I put it down to 0.
you see how kind of glassy it is.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.820
So. that's cool! Refraction Distortion is not going to make any difference here. because we've got a

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.770
purely reflective shader. Alright so.
that's the shader. which is the thing

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.880
which is responsible for choosing how
that surface of the water looks.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.979
The water is actually just flat. and the
shader is very cleverly making it look

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:12.160
like it's not flat. So. play with the
properties of your water yourself. and

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.509
get your water looking how you would
like it to look.
