00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
Hey guys! Let's make a landing area
prefab. We'll create a landing area prefab.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.599
We'll be using the flare particle effect,
setting the game to start at dusk, and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.179
then, making the player deploy the flare, although you'll be doing that last bit.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.680
[Does Funny Voice] So, let's make this prefaby thing! So, on the player, we already have this clear area

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.410
dude here, which is looking for a clear
area. I think the first thing I'm going

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:36.160
to do is to re-scale this in the Y, to what? 20 meters, 30 meters, 40 meters, 30 meters

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.129
let's say, which means I need to offset its
center by, I think 20, no 16 meters,

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.680
so it still sits 1 meter off the
ground,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.930
avoiding the grass. Ok perfect! So, that
means that it will be hitting more

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.230
tree canopies. So, re-scale your clear area box collider to 30 in the Y size and then 16 Y

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.000
offset, so it sits like that, and it'll
still work it'll still find the clear areas.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.860
In fact, it may have less bugs with
regards to missing trees, than before.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.530
Oh, on that topic, why are we missing trees quite frequently. If you've moved

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.369
your trees like I have, then look at my Navmesh, you see my trees have moved and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.750
I haven't re-baked the Navmesh, so all of
these holes in the ground are just

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.820
wrong. So, this is only to do with
navigation, but while you're here, it's a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.340
good time to re-bake the Navmesh, if
you've moved your trees, remember to do that.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.829
Otherwise, your AI Agent can run
straight through trees, which will look a

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.729
bit odd. So, there's a tip for you, I'll leave
that baking in the background. Right!

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.160
So, under Prefabs, I want to create a new
prefab for a clear area or for a landing

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.490
area, so I'm just going to drag that over
here and rename it Landing Area.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.320
Fantastic! So, if I pop the landing area in the scene, then this is

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.420
going to be something that the helicopter
can target. I'm going to make sure that,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.759
that actually sits a meter off the ground, like we want. I think it is? Yep, that's fine!

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.260
Ok great! So, we have this landing area. So far, we have

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.650
just a collider and a Clear Area Script. We don't want a Clear Area Script on it,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.140
so remove the Clear Area Script from
the Landing Prefab and import the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.930
Particle Effects, the Particle Systems
Package. Now, we can have the whole lot,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.659
if you want. All we're actually looking for is the flare, but I'm going to import the

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.339
whole lot. Here it comes, it's going to take a while. It's going to make your project a bit bigger.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.700
We're going mad on project size, in this particular section. So, what I want

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.739
to do is I want to add a flare to this
landing area, so one of the easiest ways

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.769
to work on the landing area is to
instantiate it, by dragging it into the

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.489
scene, and then, we want to create a child object called the flare. So, what we

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.879
want is that when the player pops out a
landing area, it has a flare in the middle

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.019
of it, and then, later we'll make the
helicopter vector for this position.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.260
So, I'm going to add to this a particle effect, but you don't just add a component,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.959
because we want a complete prefab.
So, if you inspect your standard assets in your

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.139
particle systems now, you'll find somewhere that we have a flare. Here it is!

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.000
So, let's make that the sub-object of the
landing area. So, this flare prefab... I can

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.340
get rid of that other one. So, a common
mistake would be to try and add it as

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.919
a particle system, but that won't get the
full prefab. A flare is quite a complex

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:35.709
thing actually, it has smoke and sparks, but it all comes as part of this pack. Ok

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.410
cool! So, what I'm going to do now is just
turn the light down to nighttime. So, let's

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.590
rotate this around to say 180 degrees, there you go. It's pretty dark now, dusk at least.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.980
And where's my flare? In the wrong place! I'm going to reset the position of the flare, compared to the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.720
landing area. I want it right in the
middle of the landing area. There, that's

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.010
pretty good, apart from it needs lifting just
off the ground. Fine! And I'm going to make

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.790
the Start Size 5, instead of 0.5. That looks Ok there. So, you get the idea.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:14.230
If I update the prefab, the landing area prefab now, then

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.229
in theory I can drop this prefab back in, and we can instantiate this at run-time. Boom!

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.850
There it is! Now, has that worked? The flare will only work when you preview it.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.070
So, if we go to the Game Mode, of course,
then it would be there, but you will only

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.400
see it in the Scene View when you actually click on it. Here it is, there's the flare, and there is a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.699
collider around this landing area, which is going to give the

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.830
helicopter something to vector towards. Perfect, so we have a good landing area

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.210
prefab. Now, what I want you to do is to
instantiate that landing area prefab,

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.199
3 seconds after the clear area is found,
and ensure the collider is visible

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.320
in the Scene View, once it's instantiated. So, go ahead, pause the video, and get that

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:04.440
coming out after the clear area is found.
Cool! Welcome back! So, how are we going to

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.500
do that? There's a question for you! So, where do we find the clear area? We find it

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.530
over here in clear area, but we send a
message

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.530
upwards OnFindClearArea. And one of the things that receives that, at the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.110
higher level, is the player, so that's
where I want to be dealing with it.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.250
We are going to invoke the DropFlare, and we already have the DropFlare method.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.180
It's here that we are going to drop the flare. So, one of the easiest ways to get the flare in,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.940
is just to publicly expose a GameObject
called a flarePrefab, like that, and I like

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.360
to immediately go over and find that and
connect it, so that we don't forget it.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.380
Now, if I just search for the word flare, then I'm not finding it. That's strange, why not?

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:54.520
Oh, good question, let me have a look... flare. I don't trust that, because this is

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.210
their flare prefab, and we have our own
prefab, which is landing area. So, what I'm

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.270
doing is I'm getting confused between
just the flare and the whole

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.700
landing area. So, it's actually a naming issue, it's landingAreaPrefab.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.699
See how important naming things is. Build the script back over to

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.199
Unity, and then, now we're of course
looking for a landing area. So, if I now

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.600
search for landing area, and there you go, simple confusion.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.880
So, there's the landing area prefab, and
of course, the way to instantiate it is the

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.380
simple instantiate command. So, we're going to instantiate. We've already put the 3

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.350
second delay in, so we're going to Instantiate  the landing area prefab, at the position of the

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:41.610
current player. Now, we need the small
transform.position, small letter, because

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:49.600
we want the instance, and we want to
transform.rotation.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.160
Perfect, so we're going to instantiate this landing area, at the

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.240
position and rotation of the player.
Let's make sure it works. Look at the

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.060
Hierarchy, there is no landing area in it, at the moment.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.270
Why do I have a flare hanging off me? Ok, if you have a flare hanging off the

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.990
player, this is why. That landing area has
had a flare attached to it, because when

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.800
I created the landing area, from the
sub-object of the player in a voice down

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.430
here, I actually then started modifying
it and then that's modified this guy,

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.130
and this should be Clear Area not Landing
Area. So, how do you break a prefab connection,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.810
when you've done that. Well, you go to
GameObject and Break Prefab Instance

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.730
like that, and now this is no longer
connected to this landing area.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.910
And then we can fix it, we can put it back to Clear Area, which it should have been.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.360
We can leave the box collider as it is, get
rid of the flare, and add the script back.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.800
Ok, so if you ever do that, you prefab
something, and you get an accidental

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:55.050
connection, it's GameObject, Break Prefab
Instance. Alright! Now, when we play we don't

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.100
have this flare hanging off us. We're at dusk, which is pretty cool! It's only

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:08.080
going to get darker. Go and look for somewhere, wait. [Game Character Says] This looks like a pretty good landing area!

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.200
I'm going to lay down a flare and call for a HELO. [Ben Starts Talking Again] There's the flare! Cool! There go all the

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.630
radio calls, and then, if we look at this, look we have a landing area, there with

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.770
smoke coming out. Pretty cool! So, we've
done everything we want to for this

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.470
video. We have instantiated landing area, we have a flare; later, we can make the

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.030
zombies spawn on this position. And the
helicopter, when it gets close enough, can

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.360
give us a call, a one minute call, to say I can see the flare, I'm vectoring to your

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.650
position but that's it. We have a pretty
cool set up there, with a landing

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.710
area prefab. We've learned about breaking prefabs. I've made several mistakes in this

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.600
video and left them in for you, because
it's real. So, congratulations on getting

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.940
this far. I hope your landing area is cool.
And actually,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.070
before I go, I was going to go, but I'm going to do one more thing, which is I want to make the

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:59.170
day cycle a little bit faster. I personally am going to just make

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:04.000
things progress a bit faster, than they do. I'm going to go 300 minutes per second. So, watch

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.200
this. Actually, I'll go to maximize. If I now maximize on play, we start when it's

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.290
pretty dark. He goes and looks for a
landing area,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:21.510
he deploys, and see how dark it's getting and It's getting dark really quick.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.530
[Character Talks in Background] [Ben Continues to Talk] There's the flare. Now, the flare is much more visible.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.080
Now, the zombies are going to start spawning onto that flare. If you want to put the flare right on

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:37.480
the ground, that's fine. And we're going to have to get the hell out of this area, because it's going to start to get hectic with zombies. So, see you soon.
