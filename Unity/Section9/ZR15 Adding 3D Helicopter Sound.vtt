00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
Hey hey hey! Should be a fun video, we're
going to be dealing with helicopters and

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.000
3D sounds. So, we'll talk a bit about 3D sounds, attach and tweak our first 3D sounds,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.540
and arrange a simple helicopter landing.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.949
All nice and easy, so go over into Unity. If you go and download your Start Pack,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.359
from the beginning of the section, you
will find in there this Helicopter Asset.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.230
Now, I've got permission from, Dwayne, the guy who made it, to include this in the course.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.910
You can't use it for commercial purposes,
but you can use it for fun, as part of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.230
the course. So, he has provided it to us with
a simple animation. I have provided you

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.360
with a helicopter sound, as well,
repeating sound there. We also have

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.100
a helicopter model and you can see that it's all nicely tagged up, and inside that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.719
model you've, got it split up into back
rotor, top rotor, etc.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.079
He's got a little fly animation,
which you can preview there. So, pretty

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.590
cool hey! So, this is using somebody else's assets. You can see the materials,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.420
all the things on the helicopter, wrapped
around a sphere like that. So, it's a Call

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.600
Asset. OK, so how are we going to get this into the scene. Well, we have a helicopter

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.140
placeholder right there. What I'm going to do is, I'm just going to copy the component.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.540
I'm going to put my helicopter prefab into the scene, like that, which

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.890
is called Helicopter 1, because it comes with a load of stuff. I don't want to have to rebuild

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.079
that. I'm going to paste the component values on there. Now, what happened to the

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:35.579
scale? So, undo and have a look at his
default scale. It's 0.01, 0.01, 0.01.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.300
OK, so I'm going to paste my values over
the top which, will put the helicopter

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.430
where I wanted it, but you need to be
careful about the scale. There it is. And then, what

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.470
else do we need from our placeholder
helicopter? Well, the script, so let's add the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.220
component to our helicopter script, who is going to listen for... Well, the helicopter script is

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.030
actually going to do all the behavior,
but for the moment it's going to

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.670
just listen, for the key press. And it's going to need a cool sound which, we'll make

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.790
in a moment. Then, we can do away with our old helicopter, and basically, after all that

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.770
messing around, we have a helicopter, but
that actually, when you look at it, is in the same place,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.710
under the water. Let's bring it up above
the water, so there it is. It's in the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.160
same place, just sitting there, chilling
out. It can be floating in mid-air,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.270
because the player can't see it. It's
fine to be there, as long as it's out of

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.780
sight, and it has a mesh renderer on it, an
animator on it, and it's looking fine.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.720
So, if we play the game and go into the
Scene View, and look at the helicopter

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.680
there, it's just sitting there, right now.
It doesn't have any animation on it.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.920
That's fine. We'll be listening for that key press, so

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.440
we need a helicopter call sound, let's do
that first. So, I'm going to go to Audacity,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.530
which you can get for Mac or PC for free.
Now, if you're going to download Audacity, be

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.940
careful where you get it from, for me. If I put Audacity into Google, let's not

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.450
get it from Source Forge,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.690
because I saw Source Forge kind of suck. I think you're probably best off getting it from www.audacityteam.org.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.020
Yep, this is the right place!

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.640
OK, so go grab it from there, if you need
something like Audacity. It doesn't

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.430
matter how you record the sound, make your own sound, go ahead and do that, and I think that's

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.770
going to be fun! So, I'm going to record mine now. Rescue Helicopter 01 Inbound ETA five minutes.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:30.640
How does that sound, apart from very silly? So, I'm just going to cut it. [Makes Funny Noises] Cut!

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.860
You know, I really don't know how to use
Audacity.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.160
[Makes More Funny Noises] Somewhere here, Remove Audio, Cut. How's that? That should do it. [Recording Plays in Background]

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.400
That sounds completely ridiculous, which is just what we want.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.720
So, let's just cut that. Fantastic! Now, I'm going to Save As or Export to an .ogg file, because, by the way, if

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.960
you use an mp3 file, and you put
that in a commercial game, you

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.230
are supposed to pay for an mp3 license.
Woohoo scary! So, let's not do that, let's

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.620
use an .ogg file. So, I'm going to go directly into my repos. Actually, you may

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.870
not realize that you can put things
directly into the relevant folder, so if I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.000
go to Zombie Runner, and then, I go to Assets, and then, I go to Start Pack, and then, I go to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.250
Helicopter. And I can just say cool sound, like that, and then, save it as an .ogg

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.080
file. And when I get over into Unity, then
the call sound will be right there. Cool! So, now

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.690
we can go give this script to the call
sound, and let's see if this works, at least.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:43.360
Hit play, helicopter called. Now, it didn't work, because our script is incomplete, so your

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.900
job now, is a challenge for you. What I
want you to do is, add and tune your helicopter's sound.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.630
Make your own helicopter sound, make
it play. Remember, you're going to have to put

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.750
an AudioSource on the helicopter, and then,
try playing around with the 3D sound

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.750
settings and see if you can get it
sensible. Now, you might want to move the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.830
helicopter into the scene, for this
exercise, and see if you can get it

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.740
sensible. If you can't, I'm going to show
you, in the solution to the challenge, how to

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.510
make this sensible as you approach the
helicopter, so move it into the scene,

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.990
put the sound on it, get it triggering, when
you put H, and see if you can make it all work nicely.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:26.710
See you in a second. Cool! Cool! Cool! Cool! So, welcome back! I'm going to firstly, put my helicopter in the scene, as I said.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.900
As I said, I'm just going to put it on the other side of the wall, just for testing purposes. That will do, it's a semi-

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.940
sensible position. It's even nearly on the
ground. There you go, it pretty much is on the ground now.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.160
Fine, I think I'm going to put the
animation on it, because

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.820
it's asking for an animation controller there and we've got one. There you go, it's called fly, so why not

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.220
just do that. If I then go look at the helicopter in the Scene View, you see it looks much

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.870
better. Fine! And then, we need to put a
sound source on it. Don't worry, because

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.110
at the moment, It's got nothing no reason to make a sound, so it's called an audio

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:06.780
source. There it is Audio Source. OK, so now that it has an Audio Source, what we need to do is push

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.150
the script into this Audio Source... Not the
script, the clip into this Audio

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.190
Clip here by script. OK, we don't need to worry about sending it out to mixes or anything else.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:25.580
We don't want to Play On Awake, we do want it 3D sound, we want the Spatial Blend to

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.550
be 100% 3D. You'll see that, in a minute, one problem you may have had

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.980
when you tried this is, if it was 100% 2D, then the sound will just be

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.480
the same volume, regardless of distance.
So, you want a Spatial Blend of 100% 3D.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.740
So, the sound volume is going to depend entirely on the distance from it.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.870
OK. So, that's the only thing you need to
change. Now, we need to go back to the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.270
Helicopter Script don't we, and we need to play with that, so that it actually sets

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:55.669
and plays this audio clip. So, we're going
need a private AudioSource audioSource;

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:06.749
OK. [Laughs] Now, let's go find that AudioSource. Now, it's just GetComponent, because it's already on this thing.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:13.460
So, we found the AudioSource, and then, where it says helicopter called, yeah we can

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.330
still send that to the log. Now, if we're going to leave it in, I'm going to Debug.Log,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:25.940
it's just a little bit more robust. And then, I'm going to say audioSource.clip = callSound;

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:35.960
OK, and then, we need to go audioSource.Play ();

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:46.040
That's a method. Cool! Let's see what happens.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.040
OK, helicopter call. Now, did it make a sound? We don't know. So, how are you going to test it? Well, you can go and

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.460
get closer to the helicopter, or you could set its Spatial Blend to 100% 2D, for a minute,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:03.930
and then try. Ah, you see that's OK
isn't it. Because what's happening there

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:09.730
is the sound is happening everywhere
in the scene, because it's 100% 2D.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:15.010
Alright, so that's fine. So, how are we going to tune the sound, so that we can hear

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.470
it? And how about the actual wacky wacky sound of the helicopter blades?

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.860
Well, we've actually got two different AudioSources we want to hear. The AudioSource

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:31.830
for the helicopter's radio sound could be on the helicopter, but it is

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.190
kind of 2D, because it comes to us through
radio waves and plays in our ears. So, we've

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.480
got a couple of different options here,
one of which is to add another AudioSource

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.360
to this helicopter and use that second AudioSource for its wacky wacky

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.250
sound. I'm going to do that. So, this is
outside of the scope of what we did in

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.520
the challenge. So, in the challenge I just
wanted you to make it play and it does

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.620
play, and it plays if you leave the Spatial Blend on 2D, which is simulated

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.910
coming through the radio. What I also want is a permanent clip on here, which is the

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.590
helicopter wacky wacky sound, like that,
and I want it to loop and Play On Awake.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.180
And then, if I play now, watch what happens.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.960
Wherever we are, we can hear that helicopter, even though we're nowhere near it. What we want

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.630
to do is set the Spatial Blend to 100% 3D. Now, as I stand here,

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:24.820
I can't hear the helicopter. Now, is that too
quiet? Well maybe, maybe not. Let's look at

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.690
the details of this second AudioSource. So, what have we got? We've got

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.850
a Minimum Distance of 1. Well, actually
you probably can hear the helicopter

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.200
pretty loud from 10 meters, so I'm going to make a Minimum Distance of 10 and a Maximum

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.480
Distance of, yeah let's say, 500 meters. So, why can't I hear this at the moment?

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.190
Well, it depends how far away I am. Let's
have a look at where the helicopter is

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.010
and where the player is. So, I've got to go
along the side of this lake. Let me try

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.690
that and see if the helicopter gets
louder. Where's my lake? I can't really see. I'll have

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:02.190
to go into Scene View to see which
direction to go in. I'm not sure.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:12.230
I should be able to hear it, in one direction. I think my lake is over here, isn't it? Am I getting closer?

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.850
Further away? I think I'm getting closer.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:23.290
You can turn gizmos on in Game View, by the way, if you want to, which can help with

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:34.910
this sort of thing. I'm completely lost, I need to turn to my right. So, that can be a bit of fun.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:40.170
OK, so basically the bottom line here is
that the helicopter is too quiet. I need to be able to hear

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.420
more of the helicopter than I am, from a
distance. So, the things that you can play

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:50.150
with, with regards to the helicopter's sound are the Minimum Distance, which I

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.550
say I'm going to have that as 10 meters
let's say, and then, you've got to decide on

00:10:54.550 --> 00:11:00.150
the Maximum Distance, maybe 1,000, like that. And then, you can pull

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:06.890
the curve around, if you want to, until it
works. Let's have a listen. I can actually

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:12.120
hear the helicopter now. It's really quiet, so
I've got to work out which direction.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.800
So, I'm just going to cheat here. I'm going to take the helicopter, move it closer to the player.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:24.800
Ha, now I can see the helicopter, over there just, and as I run towards it, now my footsteps

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.170
are far too loud. So, let's fix that. Go to the player, look at the Footstep Audio

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.519
Source, on the player, and just turn the
volume down to maybe 25%. OK, let's

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:41.899
carry on. Now, if we inspect the helicopter, while we do this, remember it's got two audio sources on it.

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:51.680
One is when we hit H, and that's a 2D sound, that plays straight into my ears, regardless

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.279
of my distance from the helicopter, and
then, we've got this other one, which is much

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:58.060
more complicated. Now, look at the red line here. Watch as I move towards the

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.200
helicopter, that red line is decreasing, as
my distance decreases, and listen.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:13.860
Got another wacky tree there. Now, as we start to get really close listen. Much louder and then, that Minimum

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:20.960
Distance, of 10 meters, has a massive effect on its volume, at a distance. Look at it. If I go here,

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.770
Ethan is after me, and I change this Minimum Distance, it gets far too quiet out here.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:30.450
So, you want a Minimum Distance of 10,
maybe 15 meters. Trust me, I fly

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.930
helicopters. When you get within 10 to 15
meters, it's not much different, whether

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.700
you're there or there, it's very loud, and
that helps, because of the way it's logarithmic

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.670
roll off, it helps keep it at a sensible volume, at a distance. So, I'd suggest a Min

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:48.250
Distance of say 10 Meters or 15 and a Max
Distance of at least 500. I might try a Max

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.660
Distance of 1,000, see how that works.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:56.010
This doesn't make a lot of difference, at this distance. OK fantastic! So, I'm just going to

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.430
check my settings have stuck on there. I need to look at the bottom

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:05.180
Audio Source, 10, 500, Logarithmic Role Off, all very cool! So, that's our sound working

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.850
for our helicopter. Congratulations if you've got that working!

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.050
And if you enjoyed playing with helicopter sounds, then do comment in the

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.260
discussions. I'm just going to do a quick
recap for you.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:22.380
The helicopter script that we have on
here is taking in a cool sound, so that

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.440
it can pass it to this second AudioSource. Why do we need two audio sources?

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.440
Because, while we hear the wacky wacky of
the helicopter,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.560
we also want to be able to hear the radio.
Now, you could argue that you only need one

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.090
AudioSource, because you
won't be able to hear the helicopter until

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.080
you've called it. So, you could just use a
single AudioSource and swap the clips

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.950
around. I'm just showing you a technique
of using two AudioSources, so that we

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.510
can get, for instance, close to the
helicopter, if we wanted to, and then,

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:53.830
call it, which sounds crazy. But depending on how you've set your game up, you may want to

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.290
do that, and then, you would be able to
hear the helicopter wacky wacky

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:04.300
sound. And then also, on top of that, be able to hear the sound of the

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:14.140
radio. Let's try it. You can hear the helicopter there. OK, so you don't have to use two AudioSources.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.380
I've chosen to and I just wanted to show you the difference.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.680
The other thing is that the radio one, the
other reason to use two, is that the radio

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.590
is a 2D sound, regardless of your
distance, you hear it the same, and the

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.430
other one, is a purely 3D sound and you
can make a blend in between them.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.100
OK, so hopefully that's enough about 3D
sounds, for you to get a good idea as to

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.720
what's going on. Hopefully that's been fun
for you, and I'll see you in the next video.
