00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
Welcome back! In this video we're going to be scaling our characters. using a reference.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.160
cube in our scene.  setting up your first
person character's eye height. and checking

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.609
character scale against the environment.
So. let's dive right on in.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.820
So. here we go. Now. the issue that we had was that the first person controller

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.400
eye height is very very high. So. let's go
take a look. let's stick them both

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.270
somewhere sensible. I'm going to move both my first person controller and

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.059
my zombie somewhere fairly central. in
the middle of the terrain here. Let's just

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.059
check the first person controller sits
down Ok now. on the terrain. Yeah. there he is.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.550
Now. given that he's at 474 368. I'm just
going to bring the zombie very close. So.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.560
say 470 360. we'll put the zombie really
close to the first person. Let's have a look. Boom. there

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.140
we go. Now. if I look around. somewhere I should have a zombie... up next to me.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:12.720
No. why not? Let's look at the scene. Um huh. there he is and there I am. He's so close. I can't even see him by the looks of it.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.680
Let's take a look. There he is right down there. Ok. it's just that he's so much smaller. So. one of the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.340
first things we need to do is sort this
out. Now. who's got the scale problem?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.240
Is it the zombie? Is it us? Is it a
combination?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.920
Well. one of the first things to do is
get an absolute reference in here.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.520
So. wherever you've put your zombie and your first person in the scene. here they are.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.090
Let's put a cube. a couple of cubes down on the ground. a 3D object cube.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.439
By default that says cubic metre. which is
ideal. So. just move it down until it's

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.430
precisely on the ground. easiest just to
do that by eye. as soon as you see the geometry disappear

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.060
into the terrain around there. then it's
on the ground. And I'm going to duplicate

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.680
that and make myself another reference
cube. that is just above the first one.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.100
I might just leave a tiny gap. so I can see
where the 1 metre mark is. Cool!

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.000
So. given those reference cubes. let's go back into the game. find the cubes.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.319
Well. I'm far too big look. I'm towering over
that cube. Ethan is about the right

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.330
height actually. Cool! So. let's
get this fixed. Let's take a bit

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.740
more of a look at this first person
character. and try and understand why

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.870
his scale is so off. So. I'm going to start with the FPS Controller. I'm going to move it down to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.710
ground level. and bring it over towards
me a little bit. Any way that you can work

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.870
with it. and maybe put its Capsule Collider close to the ground. So. what's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.390
the deal with this FPS Controller. how
big is it. and where do you find that?

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.180
Well. there's lots of things on the FPS
Controller. It's quite a complex little

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.080
thing. but you'll see here that it's the
Character Controller itself here. this

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.110
bit that has a height. and if we adjust
the height the Capsule Collider goes

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.570
with it. You see that in the scene. And
it has a default height of 1.8 meters. which

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.140
is about right which means that when that
capsule is sitting on the ground. like

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.410
this. that the top of this capsule here is
at about 1.8 metres. Now. let's just

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.260
check that assumption. always check it against your reference cubes. You see

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.670
that is about right. he is about 1.8
metres. We set it to 2 metres of height.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.430
and again sitting back on the ground and
you can see it's the same height as the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.270
cubes. Alright so. that's good. that's
proving that this setting works fine.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.300
So. what's going on with this camera? It's
miles in the air. Well. the camera is

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.790
childed. remember. to the FPS Controller.
and it has a funny position. If I could set

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.610
the position to 00 it would be right in
the middle of the FPS Controller. but now.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.540
the camera is still the wrong. height isn't it. because it's at a height of what? What is

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.060
the height of the camera now? Just work
it out for me. If the FPS Controller is 1.8 metres high.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.070
the camera must be... at the moment it is half way up the

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.989
controller. so it's at 0.9 of a
meter right. So. that's too low. So. that's

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.420
the problem we are having. is the camera
is just too low. So. how high do we want

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.980
the camera? Well. one way of sorting that
out is to bring the zombie into play.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.420
So. you can use these particular widgets here. and maybe do a face-off

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.810
between the zombie and your character here and get yourself a scene where they can see

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.500
each other. And you can see that right now. in the Game View. if our camera was

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.950
rotated properly. which it's not really... Let's just change the camera rotation.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:31.490
There's the camera. let's just change the rotation say to 0. Ok! Now. if we look in the Game View we're

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.760
kind of looking halfway up this guy's back
right now. Let's just pull myself

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.740
across until we're lined up with him.
looking at the camera preview. looking

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.280
halfway up his back. So. what I want to do
is just get the camera offset such that

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.800
we're kind of eye-to-eye or possibly the
zombie is a little bit bigger than us.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.750
An easy way to do that is just to change the Y component of the camera. Make sure you're

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.340
not in play mode. of course. And I think
something like that will work. let's take

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.960
a look. Hmm. he's still a bit too tall. You could always spin your zombie around. by the way. so you're facing the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:07.060
front of him. Something like that. let's try it. So. Let's move around and see how this zombie fairs.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.600
You can run by holding down Shift.
to get away from him. Pretty good!

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.360
He's still not very scary at that height. so I
think I'm going to put my camera to a height

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.500
of say 0.4. and that makes the zombie
placeholder guy a little bit more kind of scary.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.570
There you go. you've got that 1 metre
object in the scene or two 1 metre objects.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.590
And you've got the zombie and this all feels a lot more sensible. down from this

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.700
height. So. what I want you to do now is
to do that for yourself. but also while

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.320
you're at it. check your zombie and
all your reference cubes against things

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.560
like the trees. Do they stack up against
the trees? So. if I move this guy over

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.270
towards this tree over here. is that
tree too big? I would say my trees probably are a

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.140
little bit too big actually. And also. the
other question is your terrain features.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.820
You know take your zombie or your cubes and move them over to

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.340
a terrain feature. like a dip in the land.
like over here. and say to yourself: Well.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.330
is this a sensible dip in the land?
Normally. if you use roughly the terrain

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.990
tools settings I did. you'll be about right. but if you are miles off and

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.720
these dips are far too big or the trees are far too big. you could scale your entire

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.320
terrain a little bit. If you have a
systemic error. you could just change the

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.500
entire terrain scale here. I would do it
the same in X and Y. so you don't create

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.320
distortions. otherwise you may need to
just go back and make a few tweaks to

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.289
your tree settings. for example.

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.889
So. you'd go back to the terrain. you'd go
back down to where we have trees. and you

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.899
may want to just mass place a new set of
trees. I do think these trees are a

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:44.830
little bit too high. so where this tree
height was here. I might want to just knock it down a

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.889
little bit. and then. mass place a load of
new trees. not keeping existing trees.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.189
So. I might want to put 500 trees in without existing trees. and are they the

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.819
right height now? Well. they're better. they're much better. so I think I'm going to do that.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.849
That's how you would change your trees
systematically. You change the height here.

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:06.599
you click Mass Place. you don't keep
existing trees. if you don't want to keep

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:11.199
existing trees. but be careful. because if
you lose them then of course...

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.309
all the hard work you may have done
of say taking trees out of the water and

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:18.069
things could get lost.

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.699
So. be careful if you're going to do it that
way. but if you want to spend the

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.990
time then go ahead and just remove
trees that are sitting in the water. Remember.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.490
you do that with the Paint Trees Tool
while holding down Shift. So. you're going to need to

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.019
go back around the terrain and take any
ridiculous trees out. that sit say in

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:38.009
the water. And I think it's worth
spending the time to do that. just to tie

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.129
it all together and to get the scale
feeling about right. Now. it's quite easy to

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.759
end up selecting off the Tree Painting Tool. so just be a little

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.249
bit careful with that. And if you want to
maximize your Scene View. before you do

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:54.019
this. it makes quite a bit of sense. because then you can see what you're doing. So. I'm just going

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:57.229
to have a quick look around my terrain.
and say: Well. where do I really not want

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:02.969
trees? And then. make sure that I unpaint
trees from where it's done them in the

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:06.539
wrong place. Now. of course it's very lazy
just randomly painting trees like this.

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:11.610
but it does save us a lot of time. So.
there's something to be said for it. but

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.779
you know you get what you pay for. if you like. If you don't spend the time then.

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:19.110
you're not going to get the best effect
on your trees. Ok so. you get the idea.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.449
That's what I want you to do now. is
go and get your terrain scale right.

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:26.069
the height features of your terrain and your trees and all the dips in the land.

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:30.539
compared to the characters. I'm going to delete my reference cubes. and then leave you with

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:37.159
a challenge slide as follows.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.969
Get your character's eye height just right. check Zombie placeholder against the trees.

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:46.370
etc.. and share a photo of your
zombie or zombies if you want to duplicate

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.670
them. against some sort of backdrop maybe some pretty water and sun or something

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.959
like that. Let's get a zombie placeholder
group shot and stick it in the

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:57.499
discussions. So. go ahead get all your
scaling feeling right. and I will see you soon.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:05.560
Cool! Welcome back! So. I've kind of already done the scaling. before I showed you this challenge.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.699
So. remember to recap. you could rescale the entire terrain and see the affect that. that has. That's over in

00:09:11.699 --> 00:09:16.259
the Terrain Settings here. so terrain. the
settings cog. and then. you change the

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:22.189
Terrain Width and the Terrain Length. If you want to do that. another way to do it is

00:09:22.189 --> 00:09:26.490
to repaint all the trees that you've put
in on mass. Now. there's a recap of the way

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.709
that we do that. is that we go to the
Paint Trees Setting here. the Place Trees.

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:36.810
Then. you Mass Place Trees. after having changed the height. Now. you've got a range of

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.680
heights. it's random in this range from
Minimum to Maximum. and you can also just

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.240
drag the middle of it. So. you choose your
variability through the width and then the

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.420
mean of the height through the position of the slider. And then.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.670
you Mass Place your trees. ditching the other ones. I wouldn't put more than 1.000

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.350
trees in a terrain. I think you might end up with performance

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.939
problems. but that just depends on your
computer. So. you just need to be thinking

00:09:58.939 --> 00:10:03.660
about what it's going to be run on. So. that's it! We have a terrain and

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.699
directional light and a first person
controller and a water table. And we have

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:10.810
reasonably sensible scaling. so that now
when we play our game we're down here on

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.510
the floor. and somewhere there should be
a zombie trying to get me.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.460
And remember. if you can't find your zombie. your single lone zombie then. go into Scene

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.250
View and double click. and you will then
be able to zoom out and see where he is in

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.470
the terrain. Turning on things like the
Transform Tool will help you to visualize

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.069
where he is. and there he is patiently
waiting for me there. And if I run away and

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:36.050
turn around and do some finger gymnastics. you can see him chasing me through the

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.300
world. and it's much more kind of
sensible now. It's much more like a

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.250
sensibly scaled world. So. there you go! I look forward to seeing you in the next video!
