00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.559
Hey guys. and congratulations on getting to
the end of Zombie Runner! So firstly. you'll

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.269
notice that Brice is. this way. is not next
to me. and that's because he's moved on to

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.890
another project. He actually only lives down
the road. I see him once every week or two.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.890
but he's moved on from the course. so you
won't be seeing him in any upcoming sections

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.640
but that's why Brice isn't next to me. Right.
so we have finished Zombie Runner. Now. it

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.969
feels pretty unfinished right. and that's
because I want you to finish it. As we tale

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.660
out the last couple of sections of this course.
I really want to get you in the habit of finishing

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.790
the games you start. so that's the reason
I've left it like that. Also. if I was to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.840
go and add a UI and enemy spawning and all
these other things. it's very much repeating

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.079
things you've already learned. and we don't
want that. So. well done getting this far

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.560
in the course. Please do go and make these
suggested customizations on the slide. a couple

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.000
of videos ago. things like maybe skinning
the zombie with a free mesh from the Asset

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.390
Store. Certainly arrange your enemy spawning.
get the UI on there. and get the game up on

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.780
the discussions and share it. maybe pop a
video on YouTube. or if you really want to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.970
push the boat out. it's time that you guys.
who have got this far in the course. start

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.830
thinking about actually publishing your courses
to iOS or the Android store and actually getting

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.530
those out there in public and showing us that
way. So. a few people have already done that

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.810
with some of the games. this would be a great
game to consider doing that with as well.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.950
I hope you've enjoyed the section. and I look
forward to seeing you in our future content.
