00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780
Hey hey! So. let's talk about normalizing
spelled the American way. audiophiles!

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.760
We'll be recording a few more dialogue
placeholders. in my case finished assets.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.920
Remember that you may need a mp3 license. We'll be talking about normalizing sound

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.130
volume and then attaching and organizing audio. or organizing and attaching audio. So. if we

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.810
have a quick look at Wikipedia here.
you'll find that there's a bit of a long

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.160
article about whether or not you need a
license for mp3 audio. I think the bottom

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.649
line is. you do if you're going to be making
a commercial game. For the sake of sharing in

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.510
the course. I wouldn't worry about it. So.
that's the first thing. and the other

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.930
thing is. what audio formats does Unity
support? Well. I may have covered

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.250
this before. but I'm briefly going to recap that it supports several but the main ones to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.170
consider are mp3 or Ogg. Either of those are very multi-platform and will work fine.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.230
I'm going to use mp3. from now on. So. let's just go ahead and start attaching all of

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.450
our sound files and then. testing things.
So. what needs sound? The helicopter!

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.720
It's already got a sound. but it's not normalized. so let's show

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.020
you what normalization means. I'm going to open the helicopter sound in Audacity. like so.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.080
and then. I'm going to go to Effect and
Normalize. And what that does is it makes

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.940
sure that the sound volume fills the
envelope. It's actually set to 1 decibel

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.760
away from the top and bottom. If we do
that with all our sound files then. they

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.869
all have a standard volume. and we're also going to just export these back as mp3

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.849
files. Now. the helicopter ought to go in the Helicopter Folder. that makes sense. So. let's do that now.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.920
Ok. fantastic! And then. let's just go
through and attach that. So. each one I

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.430
get to. I'm just going to attach it as I
go. So. we have two helicopters. a quiet

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.960
one and a loud one. I'm going to use the loud one. This may mess around with how I have

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.210
my 3D sound setup. but I would rather the
sound was normalized. It is better to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.090
have things normalized. So. there it is. That's great! Now. the player. what do we have on the player?

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.920
We have an audio source that the First Person Character Controller is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.560
going to be using. so I'll minimize that
down. we don't need it. We have a Clear

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.349
Area... Inner Voice! Ok so. we need a What Happened

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.049
Sound. Do we have that? Yep. we have a What Happened Sound. but it's in Ogg format. I want to pop it into mp3.

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.929
It's also again not normalized. so
normalizing

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.799
won't make a lot of difference on this. you can see it's already close to normalized.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:44.370
Pop it in here as a... you don't Save you Export from Audacity. If you save it. it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.860
saves as a native Audacity File.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.640
Again. you can get Audacity on Mac and PC. What happened? Let's put an mp3 version of

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.160
that in. Sorry that it says hell in there. I
hope that doesn't offend anybody. There's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:07.970
the mp3 version there. Fantastic! So. the
player needs an Inner Voice. with a What

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.920
Happened Script. Now. good landing area. We don't have a good landing area recording.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.160
let's make one immediately. It's good to just do things as you get to them. so here's a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.640
new Audacity File. I'm going to record
myself a good landing area file now. [He Records]

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.180
This looks like a pretty good landing area!
I'm going to lay down a flare and call for the HELO!

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.900
Now. my audio is clipped here. [Plays Audio Clip in Background]  And that's clipped at source. so I need to re-record that.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.910
[He Records] This looks like a pretty good landing area! I'm going to lay down a flare and call for a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.489
HELO! Ok now. there's no clipping there. which is good.

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.349
That's the bit I'm going to export. but in the meanwhile I'm just going to

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.959
normalize that again. which again makes
sure these picks are about right. Fantastic!

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:03.239
And Export Selection. and this is going to be good area.mp3. Ok so. fairly simple.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.560
What I want you to be doing while you're
watching this is. or I think you're going to get

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.030
the idea already. is just go through and
set up all of your clips. as well. That's the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.419
basic idea of this. So. what else needs
some sound? The radio system needs two

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.940
clips. It needs the initial helicopter call.
which is Call Sound. I'm actually going to move

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.340
the directory of that. That doesn't really make sense to be against the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.150
helicopter. [Plays Audio File in Background] That's Ok. I'm going to leave
that one as it is. but I am going to

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.910
normalize it and change it to an mp3
format. And change it's folder at risk of

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.680
confusing people. So. I'm going to say initial call reply. I think is

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.490
what we were calling it in the code.
Fantastic! Now. I immediately know that I

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.020
need another sound. so once I've put
initial call reply in. which is in audio here against

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.010
the radio system... you see the sound all kind of goes against the things that

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.950
make sense. I need an initial heli call. I
never made an initial heli call. so let's do that now.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.520
I don't know what to call... I've created blank. What am I going to do here? Let's have a think.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.340
Help! Help! I'm... No. that doesn't sound very gruff does it. [Jokes Around &amp; Uses High Pitch Voice] Help! Help! I'm a stranded

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:30.880
soldier. Let's try again. [He Records] Special Forces 07 stuck in some zombie infested hell hole. calling for HELO

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:40.220
extraction. Something like that. who cares. Now. let's normalize. You don't have to select

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.250
before you normalize here. by the way. I'm just selecting. so that I'm ready to export

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:51.039
selection into my audio file. and it's
going to be initial heli call.mp3. Better now.

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.020
everything's in mp3 format. Now. it's not actually going to work this properly. and you'll

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.669
see why in just a second. There is an
almost deliberate error for you. See if

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:06.200
you can just spot what it is. [Character's Voice in Background] So. if I play now. and then. go

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.150
somewhere where the initial pull gets
triggered. we can check that by checking the Clear

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.710
Area Script. Now. we're over one second and we're over ten seconds since the start and we haven't

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.060
heard any of that happen. Now. the reason is that the Clear Area Script. if you look

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.680
at it. does a what?  A send message

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.950
upwards I believe. Yes. OnFindClearArea.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.850
which is supposed to be received by Inner Voice. Yeah. but Inner Voice isn't up the Hierarchy. so

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.420
this is where we slightly overused
messaging. It's ok. but what we're going to need

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.030
to do is put Clear Area as a child of
the Inner Voice. Now. that's going to break the

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.410
player prefab. which is okay. We can
reapply the player prefab like that. You can

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.810
always check your player prefab. make sure it looks right. Ok so. the Clear Area is a

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.380
concept. within the Inner Voice. We're stretching the Hierarchy here a little

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.340
bit. so I think it's still Ok. I think the
radio system encompasses the player and

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.160
helicopter. The inner voice has the
concept of a clear area. but you can see

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.950
we're pushing things a little bit too
far. And there are many other ways that we could be

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.400
triggering these sounds. much more standard techniques you've used before. but

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.430
I want to stick with messaging here. just
for the sake of it really. Let's try and

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:23.670
see how this goes.  [Game Character Talks] I better call for some help. Got to find an area about the size of a tennis court and call a HELO.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:31.900
This looks like a pretty good landing area! I'm going to lay down a flare and
call for a HELO. Special forces 07 stuck in

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:40.600
some zombie infested hell hole. calling
for HELO extraction! [Game HELO Pilot Replies] ...rescue helicopter 01 inbound. ETA five minutes.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.680
[Ben Starts Talking] And there's the helicopter on its way! Pretty cool! Ok. it
all works the plan came together. and

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.910
that is a reasonable communication system for all of that. So. look forward to

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.640
seeing you in the next lecture. when we will give the helicopter a landing area to aim

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.100
at and deploy a flare!

going to be using, so I'll minimize that
down, we don't need it. We have a Clear

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,349

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,049
Sound. Do we have that? Yep, we have a What Happened Sound, but it's in Ogg format. I want to pop it into mp3.

00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:32,929
It's also again not normalized, so
normalizing

00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:35,799
won't make a lot of difference on this, you can see it's already close to normalized.

00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:44,370
Pop it in here as a... you don't Save you Export from Audacity. If you save it, it

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,860
saves as a native Audacity File.

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,640
Again, you can get Audacity on Mac and PC. What happened? Let's put an mp3 version of

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,160
that in. Sorry that it says hell in there, I
hope that doesn't offend anybody. There's

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:07,970
the mp3 version there. Fantastic! So, the
player needs an Inner Voice, with a What

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,920
Happened Script. Now, good landing area. We don't have a good landing area recording,

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,160
let's make one immediately. It's good to just do things as you get to them, so here's a

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,640
new Audacity File. I'm going to record
myself a good landing area file now. [He Records]

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,180
This looks like a pretty good landing area!
I'm going to lay down a flare and call for the HELO!

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,900
Now, my audio is clipped here. [Plays Audio Clip in Background]  And that's clipped at source, so I need to re-record that.

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,910
[He Records] This looks like a pretty good landing area! I'm going to lay down a flare and call for a

00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,489
HELO! Ok now, there's no clipping there, which is good.

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,349
That's the bit I'm going to export, but in the meanwhile I'm just going to

00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,959
normalize that again, which again makes
sure these picks are about right. Fantastic!

00:03:52,959 --> 00:04:03,239
And Export Selection, and this is going to be good area.mp3. Ok so, fairly simple.

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,560
What I want you to be doing while you're
watching this is, or I think you're going to get

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,030
the idea already, is just go through and

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,940

which is Call Sound. I'm actually going to move

the directory of that. That doesn't really make sense to be against the

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,150
helicopter. [Plays Audio File in Background] That's Ok, I'm going to leave
that one as it is, but I am going to

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:36,910
normalize it and change it to an mp3
format. And change it's folder at risk of

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:44,680
confusing people. So, I'm going to say initial call reply, I think is

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,490
what we were calling it in the code.
Fantastic! Now, I immediately know that I

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:56,020
need another sound, so once I've put
initial call reply in, which is in audio here against

00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,010
the radio system... you see the sound all kind of goes against the things that

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,950
make sense. I need an initial heli call, I
never made an initial heli call, so let's do that now.

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,520
I don't know what to call... I've created blank. What am I going to do here? Let's have a think.

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,340
Help! Help! I'm... No, that doesn't sound very gruff does it. [Jokes Around &amp; Uses High Pitch Voice] Help! Help! I'm a stranded

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:30,880
soldier. Let's try again. [He Records] Special Forces 07 stuck in some zombie infested hell hole, calling for HELO

00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:40,220
extraction. Something like that, who cares. Now, let's normalize. You don't have to select

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,250
before you normalize here, by the way. I'm just selecting, so that I'm ready to export

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:51,039
selection into my audio file, and it's
going to be initial heli call.mp3. Better now,

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,020
everything's in mp3 format. Now, it's not actually going to work this properly, and you'll

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,669
see why in just a second. There is an
almost deliberate error for you. See if

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:06,200
you can just spot what it is. [Character's Voice in Background] So, if I play now, and then, go

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,150
somewhere where the initial pull gets
triggered, we can check that by checking the Clear

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:15,710
Area Script. Now, we're over one second and we're over ten seconds since the start and we haven't

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:21,060
heard any of that happen. Now, the reason is that the Clear Area Script, if you look

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,680
at it, does a what?  A send message

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,950
upwards I believe. Yes, OnFindClearArea,

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,850
which is supposed to be received by Inner Voice. Yeah, but Inner Voice isn't up the Hierarchy, so

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,420
this is where we slightly overused
messaging. It's ok, but what we're going to need

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,030
to do is put Clear Area as a child of
the Inner Voice. Now, that's going to break the

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,410
player prefab, which is okay. We can
reapply the player prefab like that. You can

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,810
always check your player prefab, make sure it looks right. Ok so, the Clear Area is a

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,380
concept, within the Inner Voice. We're stretching the Hierarchy here a little

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,340
bit, so I think it's still Ok. I think the
radio system encompasses the player and

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,160
helicopter. The inner voice has the
concept of a clear area, but you can see

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,950
we're pushing things a little bit too
far. And there are many other ways that we could be

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,400
triggering these sounds, much more standard techniques you've used before, but

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,430
I want to stick with messaging here, just
for the sake of it really. Let's try and

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:23,670
see how this goes.  [Game Character Talks] I better call for some help. Got to find an area about the size of a tennis court and call a HELO.

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:31,900
This looks like a pretty good landing area! I'm going to lay down a flare and
call for a HELO. Special forces 07 stuck in

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:40,600
some zombie infested hell hole, calling
for HELO extraction! [Game HELO Pilot Replies] ...rescue helicopter 01 inbound, ETA five minutes.

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,680
[Ben Starts Talking] And there's the helicopter on its way! Pretty cool! Ok, it
all works the plan came together, and

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,910
that is a reasonable communication system for all of that. So, look forward to

00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,640
seeing you in the next lecture, when we will give the helicopter a landing area to aim

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,100
at and deploy a flare!
