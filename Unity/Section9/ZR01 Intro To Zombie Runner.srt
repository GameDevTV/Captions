Hi and welcome to Zombie Runner! So.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
this game is a little bit more of a Sandbox Game. it's not a complete game.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm just showing you the essence of what you're going to need to create a First

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Person Shooter. The reason for that is. we've already covered Menu Systems

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
and a lot of other things. by this stage in the course. and I want to focus on

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
the things that are different about this type of game. So. we're going to be looking at

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500
Pathfinding. We're going to have an animated third person character.

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
running around. chasing you. We're going to be looking at terrain and environments for the

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.500
first time and various other useful tools! So. dive into

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.933
the section. and I'll see you at the end!
