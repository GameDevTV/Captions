00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.589
Welcome back! Now, before I get into the
details of my terrain, I'm going to

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.280
introduce you to a few things. The first
of which is the First Person Character

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.420
Controller. We're going to learn what is a
First Person Controller. Why would we

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.000
want to use it? We're going to be using the Standard First Person Controller,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.939
previewing your terrain from ground
level, and that's why I want to have a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.019
First Person Controller, before I go into too much detail on my terrain.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.910
I'm going to talk about Slope Limits, and that will come clear, when we get to it. So, diving

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.940
over into Unity, we're going to need a new
Standard Asset Package. You're probably

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.610
wondering when we're going to get to these, and we're going to start getting to them on mass,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.800
now. So, import Package Characters for
me, now. Again, if you don't have it, then go

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.100
download it from Unity. And import the whole lot this time, because I happen to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.890
know there were some dependencies
between those different things, so if you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.680
try and leave out Cross Platform Input,
for example, then its going to complain at you. So, In

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.699
this case, we're going to import the whole lot and accept that it's going to make our project quite

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.439
a lot bigger. And here it is, you've got a
load of new standard assets, now. So, dig

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.019
yourself into characters, and then, First Person Character Prefabs.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.880
And you've got two. You've got an FPS controller, and a Rigid Body FPS controller. There's a couple

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.240
of different ones, and they work in slightly different ways. We're going to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.030
use the FPS Controller. So, drag that prefab, drop it onto your Hierarchy, and let's go

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.970
find it in the terrain. Now, in my case it's not in the terrain, so it needs to be

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.950
somewhere in the terrain. Put it
somewhere fairly central perhaps, and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:48.200
then, make sure that it is actually above
ground. So, in my case my terrain height

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.500
was, I think, 50. So, you're going to need
to make sure that the height of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.640
your character controller is at least 50. So, I mean look at this guy here, and you look

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.189
in the Inspector. I can go all the way down to about 50, before he ends up off

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.290
the ground. Now, why would we use a first
person character controller? Well, look at

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.920
it. Look at it in the Inspector. Look at what it's got. It's got a Character

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.270
Controller on it, which we'll talk about. It has a First Person Script, with a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.070
load of stuff, including head bobbing and
all sorts of stuff. It has a Rigid Body, it has

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.990
sound wow, and then, it also has on it a
camera, which is sitting there and you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.800
can see the camera preview. So, if you
play the game, now. Then, you can use...

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.580
Firstly, you'll probably fall to the ground. Now, if you fall through the ground, it's because

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.780
your controller is a bit too low. It may be
through the ground like this, in which

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.420
case you might be stuck in the ground or falling through it. There's no harm in

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.350
being a fair distance above the ground,
you'll just fall down and hit the ground

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.970
when you start the game. Ok so, that's one
thing, and the other thing you'll get a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.250
complaint here, there are two Audio Listeners. You can now delete the Main Camera

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.520
altogether, because you have an FPS
Controller. So, looking through the eyes

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.520
of the FPS Controller, the Mouse allows you to look around, and then, you can use Shift to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.300
run, or just hold down W to go forward
at a normal speed. Look you can look at

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.610
your world through the view of your character! You can also use Space to jump, and you can

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.130
also go up these slopes to a certain
extent. Now, look over on the right hand

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.990
side in the Inspector. You've got a Slope
Limit Option there, and what happens as we try

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.110
to go up a steep slope is when you get to
45 degrees, in this case, he can't climb,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.910
or she can't climb any further. If I made
my Slope Limit just say 5 degrees over here,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.010
remembering I'm in Play Mode so it won't remember this, then, you won't get anywhere near as far up the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.400
slope, alright. So, I'm going to make my slope and it may be 10, and this is where you can play.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.320
So, that's the purpose of putting an
FPS Controller in, right now, is it's

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.890
going to give us an appreciation for
what it's like from the character's view,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.150
and if we see spaces we like over here, where we can see the edge of the world, we can fix

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.430
those straight away. Alright so, that's why
I've put an FPS Controller in. You could

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.720
see why we would want to use it, I think. Without even going into details it's

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.800
going to save us a lot of time and it's
going to do a lot for us. The disadvantage is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.240
we're slightly letting go of control; we're not coding everything from scratch.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.140
We're having to use somebody else's
stuff, but there's plenty of help out

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.390
there, about the Standard First Person
Controller, so don't worry about it. So, that's

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.950
really all I wanted to show you for the Character Controller. I just want to

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.190
talk you through some of it's settings. You have a Slope Limit, as I said, which

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.660
is how steep a slope he can

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.460
go up. For the Step Offset, Skin Width, Min Move Distance, etc., just have a

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.270
look at the little blue book here, if you
want to find out more details about that.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.310
Let it bring up the documentation and have a read. And then, you have a First Person

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.230
Controller Script, and you can force him to
walking, you can change the Walk and Run

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.600
Speed, you can change the Jump Speed, and Gravity Multipliers and all sorts of

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.370
stuff about how you look. And you can
even clamp the looking, so that you can't

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.010
look up or down too far. You can have
Field of View Kick, which is to do with how

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.880
you're moving and how the field of view
change is. You can have Head Bobbing or

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.600
not Head Bobbing, and details of the head
bob. Look at this thing, it's incredible!

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.610
You can even change the curve of the
Head Bobbing, the Footstep Sounds, so

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.900
loads of stuff going on in the script. You've then got a Rigid Body on the guy, and

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.490
you'll notice he has a Capsule Collider.
The shape of collider here is a

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.820
Capsule Collider, and that works really
well, when you get to slopes and things.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.260
It just goes well with a slope, it allows
you to kind of start going up the slope,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and it's good for a character. First Person
Controller is a good first approximation

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.380
for a character. And then, you have an
Audio Source on this guy, as well, and

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.000
that's because he's making footsteps. Ok.
And that's the reason this has an Audio

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.740
Source on it. Now, where's the Audio
Listener? That's on the the First Person

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.950
Controller thing here, that's attached to
it. Well, what is this? I'm going to

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.410
rename it. It's not a first person character,
it's a camera, so I'm just going to rename

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.470
the thing that's attached to the FPS Controller to Camera, because that's what

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.070
it is. It's a camera that is attached to the FPS Controller, so as the FPS

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.330
Controller moves around the scene, the
camera moves with it.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.940
Ok. And that's the purpose of that setting
there,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.050
of that having the camera attached. You're looking through the eyes of this

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.250
character camera. So, let's look at the camera. What does it have? Nothing too exciting on it.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.260
The Skybox, the background, the white,
that's controlled here under Skybox, and

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.070
we'll talk a little bit later about
maybe changing the Skybox. But that's that

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.030
kind of sky element you see in the
distance.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.320
It's a perspective camera, you can change
the field of view, you can see the effect

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.870
of that there. If you want to, I'm going to
leave mine at 60, and you can turn on HDR

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.300
rendering, if you want to, but I'm going to
leave it off. That's High Dynamic Range,

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.040
let's leave things simple for now. And it
has an Audio Listener Attached, and

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.120
that's the Single Audio Listener that
we want in the scene, so as we move

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.180
around our world, we're going to be hearing things from the perspective of this first

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.380
person character. So, that's the FPS character, now. What I would like you to do is make sure you've got one in

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.980
your scene, and then, I want you to make
sure that your terrain is inescapable.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.920
So, go around the edges with your character, and make sure that you can't jump out of

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.510
the world. Adjust the terrain by raising
it, and adjust the character settings if

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.760
you want, as well. I'd suggest quite a low
Slope Limit of maybe 10 or something

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.960
like that degrees. Have a go, make sure
that you can't get out of the world in

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:24.710
any direction. Pause the video and do
that now please. Hey, welcome back! So, I am

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.790
actually going to work on my terrain a little bit here, now... start working on it. So, if

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.010
I go to Terrain Editing View and I'm
going to start going to the edges of

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.450
this terrain and at least bring up the
edges to an absolute minimum height, so

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:45.680
that the character can't easily jump out, alright. So, now that I've clicked out of here,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.140
I need to click onto the terrain. I'm going
to use Paint Height. Now, we already have

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.200
a default terrain height of 50, so how high should we make the walls around the

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.350
edge of this? I'm going to have 50 meters, so I'll add 100 meter height, I want to raise the

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.000
terrain to. I want it to go immediately there, and a brush size of 42 looks Ok.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.100
It's going to look really weird inside the game. We're just going to have a wall around the outside, but I'm

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:20.160
not going to spend stupid amounts of
time on the terrain. I'd like to leave that to your creativity.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.500
This is fine, it doesn't matter if the
hills complete on the edges.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.800
The important thing is that there's sufficient height around the outside that the

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:35.200
character cannot get out of here. So, I'm
just going to do it from a large distance.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:43.800
Pull it up to a maximum of 50, like so. And a very big game, I was playing Dragon Age

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.740
Inquisition the other day, my daughter
can find ways into added out terrain or

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.260
into places that she shouldn't be able to get to, just because she's an awesome play tester.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.130
She's only 6, but she really does things that the game designers didn't want her to do. [Laughs]

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:04.230
Bless her. [Laughs] But I'm just going to make myself like a cardboard kind of cut out box here.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.300
Clamping the height like this, you don't
have to use this Paint Height Tool, you can

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.720
just use the Raise Terrain Tool. This
Paint Height Tool is giving a slightly odd

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.590
appearance. So, let's get inside the
terrain. And now, we have this actually

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:22.200
ridiculously artificial looking wall, so
I'm not too impressed with that but let's

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.630
just go along to it. Now, if you want to get somewhere quickly, of

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.440
course you can do that. You're going to probably want your Default View

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.660
back and go into the Scene View, and what of course you can do is just find your

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.670
FPS controller, and then, use the Transform Tool to pull it across to the edge of the

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:44.770
terrain. So, here we are, I'm going to approach this wall here. I've got a Slope

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:50.200
Limit of 45, so I'm just going to change that down to say 10 degrees, and now, I'm pretty

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.170
confident I'm not going to be able to get out of this terrain. Now, you can do a much

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.150
better job of making the edges of your terrain look more like mountains, but this

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.570
is almost certainly going to be
inescapable. You'll probably find, that with

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:08.010
a lot of jumping that you can actually get
out. So, you may want to reduce your Jump

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:15.590
Speed. For example, that's one way of
stopping that happening. I'm going to do

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:25.890
that I think. See how a Jump Speed of 5 works. Now, I can't jump anywhere near as high.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.860
Arguably, this character in this game doesn't need to be able to jump at all, so there is

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.680
something to be said for just taking the
Jump Speed all the way down to 0, because even at 5 I

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.740
can work my way up the side. So, if you set the Jump Speed to 0, you won't be able to leave the ground

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.040
and jump. And now, you really won't be able to escape the terrain. So, I'm going to suggest a Jump

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.050
Speed of 0 for this guy, I don't see that
we need jumping. If you want jumping you're

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.920
going to have to play with the settings
more, to make sure your character can't get out,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.279
But we've done the basic thing here, there's possibly a hole over there, where the

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.279
character could get out, but I don't think so.

00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:01.260
With a 10 degree slope and no jumping, I
think we are trapped in this soon to be

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.339
zombie infested hell hole. So, that's the
first person character controller, that's

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:10.290
the purpose of putting it in the scene, and
I shall see you soon! Have fun playing with that!
