00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.879
Hey. welcome back guys! So. we're going to get an Artificial Intelligence Agent in our

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.700
game now. We'll be setting up our Navmesh to do that. So. I'm going to be telling

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.390
you what a Navmesh is. We'll be
setting up our terrain Navmesh. We'll be

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.240
talking a little bit about baking
settings. This is not to do with cooking! [Laughs]

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.250
We will be baking our Navmesh. and you'll
preview it. to make sure that it suits

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.260
our terrain. So. let's go back over into
Unity. and take a little look at what we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.899
need to do. We have a terrain. right. and
I've seen some fantastic different

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.360
terrains. in the discussions. please do
post yours if you haven't already.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.190
Most of what I've seen is much better
than ours. but the key here really is. we're

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.770
going to need to adjust the terrain as we
go along. because we don't really know

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.969
how suitable it is. until we play the game.
So. don't worry if you're terrain doesn't look

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.670
amazing. You can improve it as you go along. but what we need to do is to have a zombie

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.660
chase us. I already want a zombie chasing us. Now. Unity has provided us a

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.980
very useful standard asset. In fact. go ahead and look under your Standard Assets Folder

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.900
under Characters now. and then. you'll
find Third Person Characters here. And if

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.010
you don't have this pack. go to Assets.
Import Package and Characters. Once you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.200
finish that import. you should find
Third Person Character is an option.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.689
and in there. you'll have lots of things.
which you are welcome to take a look at but one

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.020
of them is a Prefab Folder. And in the Prefab Folder. you'll have a Third Person

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.250
Controller. which we're not using here
because we have a first person game. from

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.950
the eyes of the player. but we do have an
AI Third Person Controller Prefab. So. you're

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.189
welcome to drop that now. into the scene.
Let's go ahead and do that. and I'm going to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.980
set my position to say 255... 200. something like that. and let's see where that ends up putting it.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.560
It's Ok. he's sitting just above the
ground. somewhere on the map. If that puts him

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.180
in the middle of a hill for you. then
move your AI

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.290
Third Person Controller. which I'm going
to rename to Zombie01. somewhere. where he's

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.869
just off the ground. so that he falls to the
ground. when you click play.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.800
So. if you then click play. go back to the Scene View. and have a look at your zombie. You can double click on

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.460
him remember. You'll see that he's probably falling down a hill or something now or maybe just

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.810
standing there. He's a guy called Ethan. we're going to be using him as a placeholder zombie. Whether or not I

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.000
actually get around to making full zombies for this game. I think it's unlikely.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.220
I'm trying to show you the elements of the game here. but there he is. And there's a few things going on with

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.980
him. and he needs in order to be able to
to navigate to me. he needs something

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.270
called a Navmesh. So. let me show you
this stage by stage. Firstly. on your

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.680
Third Person Controller. if you look down.
it's got several elements. a Transform

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.670
which tells it where it is. an Animator
which was responsible for his kind of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.900
cool swaying action. a Rigidbody. which
gives him some physics. a Capsule

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.030
Collider. which allows him to go up and
down the slopes. a Navmesh Agent...

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.960
Hmm. interesting and we'll come back to that in a bit. and then. a couple of scripts. An AI

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.330
Character Controller Script and a Third
Person Character Script. Cool! So. there's an

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.930
overview of this guy. Now. one of the
things he has is a target. and if you drag

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.560
the First Person Controller into the
target. like that... So I've taken the First

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.970
Person Controller. from my Hierarchy. and
selected it as the target of this agent. If

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.400
you play the game now. and go to the
Scene View and look at the Agent. he's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.180
not actually moving. He's not trying to
move towards us. despite the fact that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.720
that's what we've told the system to do. We've said

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.600
chase me. and he is not chasing me right
now. So. the reason is. because there is no

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.870
Navmesh for him to follow. He does not
have a Navmesh. and there's actually a warning

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.630
along the bottom of the screen. saying
"Set destination can only be called on an

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.680
active agent that has been placed on a Navmesh". There is no Navmesh. So what

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.070
a Navmesh is. is a way of this Artificial Intelligence Agent

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.320
understanding enough about the world that it can actually navigate the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.150
world. Alright. so we're going to set up our first Navmesh. right now. So. what you want to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.380
do is click on the terrain. and we're going to open a new module. under Window. we have

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.490
Navigation. Now. for me that's over on the right. You can put it where you like. the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.790
right hand side is reasonable. And if
you're not selected on the terrain. say

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.209
you're selected on a light. it's going to
say select a mesh renderer or a terrain

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.720
from the scene. Ok so. I've selected a terrain. Now. we can leave all these settings as

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.280
they are for the moment.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.190
and just go to the Bake Tab. And what you
need to do with a Navmesh is. you

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.280
actually need to create it offline here. in this case. before you run the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.570
game. and then bake the Navigation Mesh onto the terrain. So. let's see

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.510
what that actually means. Some basic
settings the Agent Radius. half a meter is

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.560
about right. Agent Height 2 meters
is about right. Maximum Slope 45 is

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.190
about right. Step Height 40 centimetres. that's the maximum step that the agent can go up.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.030
that's about right. and we don't worry
about these advanced settings for now.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.640
So. we should just click Bake. with those settings. It's going to take a little while. You can

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.460
see the progress. down on the bottom right. What it's doing now is it's exporting the terrain tiles. and

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.160
when it's finished doing that it's then going to start calculating the Navmesh. And then. in a

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.990
moment you'll see your whole terrain fill
up with some blue indications as to

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.640
where this guy can and can't go. Now. there are a lot more advanced things we can do with

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.660
Navmeshes. He can jump. he can drop. and he can even kind of go through a portal

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.130
to somewhere else. which is the Off Mesh Links. But for now. we're just focusing on

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.190
the real basics. which is the idea of a
simple Navmesh. and this could take

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.180
a while on your machine. it might be much quicker. I'm on a Quad Core i7 here on

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.169
a laptop. it could be much slower. So. that
might take you a while and when it's finished.

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.070
have a look around you're terrain. and
you will find that the blue areas are

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.610
where this guy is going to be able to
navigate to. Now. there's a limited draw

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.680
distance on these. so you may need to
get relatively close to see it in action.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.250
And I'm using these First Person Control
Keys again W. S. A. D. while holding down the

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.710
right mouse button. and you can see the
areas of the terrain that he is able to navigate.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.850
Cool hey! So. before we go any further. I want you to create your first Navmesh. Bake a

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.300
Navmesh into the terrain. preview it in your scene. adjust either the terrain or the

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.780
Navmesh settings. things like the
slope. until it's how you want it. And then.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.919
share a screenshot of your baked Navmesh in the discussions. So. go ahead

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:24.529
pause the video and set up your Navmesh... your first version of your Navmesh now.

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:29.009
Cool welcome back! So. I'm going to stick
with what we've got here for the moment.

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.029
and just check it works before the end
of this video. And then. we'll go

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:37.769
from there. So. the way to check it works
is simply to play the game. and then go

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:40.669
to the Scene View and look at this zombie guy. Now. there he goes. he's running.

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.519
Now. he's doing some weird stuff. If we look at him. he's kind of doing mad jumping around.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:49.399
but he is effectively running. Now. if he's
not behaving right. if he's doing jumps all

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:53.069
the time like this jump jump jump. holding his arms up in the air looking like a loony. then

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:56.629
the reason is you need to go to the
zombie. and you need to go to the

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.769
Inspector for the zombie and one of his
settings in the Third Person Character

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:04.929
Script is a Ground Check Distance. So. you want to change this Ground Check

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:09.109
Distance. it's a check on distance
between the character and the ground.

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:13.519
and you want to change it to something like 2 from 0.2. a nice big value. Now. let's look

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:18.229
at the guy; double click on the zombie... in the Scene View remember. and you'll get a

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.109
quick look at how he's running across
the terrain. Now. you can follow him around.

00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:24.979
watching his Capsule Collider stay in
contact with the ground. Now. it's that

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:29.219
Capsule Collider. that capsule shaped inner collider that is going to stay in contact

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:33.179
with the ground mesh. and there he goes. he's running along the terrain after us.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.520
Let's go into the game. and you can maximize. during play by the way. by just clicking

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:41.459
here and then Maximize. And let's look
around. I'm actually. for the first time.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:45.679
feeling a little bit anxious. I know that
somewhere out there. there is a zombie running

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:50.809
across the terrain chasing me. So. let's
see if we can see him. And this is what I

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:54.109
want you to do. I want you to get to the point where the zombie actually chases you. Now.

00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:57.279
in case you've missed a bit of this
video. while we wait for him to be

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:01.679
visible. where I showed you how to make
yourself the target. it's under the

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:07.839
zombie itself in the third person... Well
sorry. in the AI Character Controller Script

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:12.169
here. and the target. we make the target
the FPS controller us. and it

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:16.739
will continually chase us. Ok. so let's go back to the Scene View. find this zombie.

00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:21.249
How's he doing? He's running along the terrain after us. So. back in Game View let's

00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:26.409
maximize. Where is he coming from? Probably from the right. I'm not sure.

00:08:26.409 --> 00:08:29.420
I'm slightly nervous that this guy is going to jump out on me in a minute.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.380
and I don't know which direction from.
Now. I don't know if the scaling is going to be

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.430
right. when this zombie gets here. We may be far too big; he may be far too small.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.320
We're going to worry about that in a
subsequent video. I just want to make sure

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.740
that he actually gets to me. because
that's a nice win. So. where is he

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:53.050
coming from? This is scary. Fun hey! For the first time. we are feeling a little bit

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.210
concerned. Oh. here he comes!

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.990
Oh. I'm not worried. look at that poxy little
zombie. He's tiny but he stops when he

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.090
gets to us and patiently stands there with
his arms by his side. Not quite the

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.720
effect we're looking for. but we clearly
have a scaling issue going on. So. what

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.910
we'll do in the next video is deal with the
relative scaling between you and the

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.490
zombie. because at the moment he's not at all scary. at that height. So. see you soon! [Laughs]

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,879
Hey, welcome back guys! So, we're going to get an Artificial Intelligence Agent in our

00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,700
game now. We'll be setting up our Navmesh to do that. So, I'm going to be telling

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,390
you what a Navmesh is. We'll be
setting up our terrain Navmesh. We'll be

00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,240
talking a little bit about baking
settings. This is not to do with cooking! [Laughs]

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,250
We will be baking our Navmesh, and you'll
preview it, to make sure that it suits

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:31,260
our terrain. So, let's go back over into
Unity, and take a little look at what we

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,899
need to do. We have a terrain, right, and
I've seen some fantastic different

00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:38,360
terrains, in the discussions, please do
post yours if you haven't already.

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,190
Most of what I've seen is much better
than ours, but the key here really is, we're

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,770
going to need to adjust the terrain as we
go along, because we don't really know

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,969
how suitable it is, until we play the game.
So, don't worry if you're terrain doesn't look

00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:54,670
amazing. You can improve it as you go along, but what we need to do is to have a zombie

00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,660
chase us. I already want a zombie chasing us. Now, Unity has provided us a

00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,980
very useful standard asset. In fact, go ahead and look under your Standard Assets Folder

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,900
under Characters now, and then, you'll
find Third Person Characters here. And if

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,010
you don't have this pack, go to Assets,
Import Package and Characters. Once you

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,200
finish that import, you should find
Third Person Character is an option,

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,689
and in there, you'll have lots of things,
which you are welcome to take a look at but one

00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:25,020
of them is a Prefab Folder. And in the Prefab Folder, you'll have a Third Person

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,250
Controller, which we're not using here
because we have a first person game, from

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,950
the eyes of the player, but we do have an
AI Third Person Controller Prefab. So, you're

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,189
welcome to drop that now, into the scene.
Let's go ahead and do that, and I'm going to

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:45,980
set my position to say 255... 200, something like that, and let's see where that ends up putting it.

00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,560
It's Ok, he's sitting just above the
ground, somewhere on the map. If that puts him

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,180
in the middle of a hill for you, then
move your AI

00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:02,290
Third Person Controller, which I'm going
to rename to Zombie01, somewhere, where he's

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,869
just off the ground, so that he falls to the
ground, when you click play.

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:09,800
So, if you then click play, go back to the Scene View, and have a look at your zombie. You can double click on

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,460
him remember. You'll see that he's probably falling down a hill or something now or maybe just

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,810
standing there. He's a guy called Ethan, we're going to be using him as a placeholder zombie. Whether or not I

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,000
actually get around to making full zombies for this game, I think it's unlikely.

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm trying to show you the elements of the game here, but there he is. And there's a few things going on with

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,980
him, and he needs in order to be able to
to navigate to me, he needs something

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,270
called a Navmesh. So, let me show you
this stage by stage. Firstly, on your

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,680
Third Person Controller, if you look down,
it's got several elements, a Transform

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,670
which tells it where it is, an Animator
which was responsible for his kind of

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,900
cool swaying action, a Rigidbody, which
gives him some physics, a Capsule

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,030
Collider, which allows him to go up and
down the slopes, a Navmesh Agent...

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,960
Hmm, interesting and we'll come back to that in a bit, and then, a couple of scripts. An AI

00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,330
Character Controller Script and a Third
Person Character Script. Cool! So, there's an

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,930
overview of this guy. Now, one of the
things he has is a target, and if you drag

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,560
the First Person Controller into the
target, like that... So I've taken the First

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,970
Person Controller, from my Hierarchy, and
selected it as the target of this agent. If

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,400
you play the game now, and go to the
Scene View and look at the Agent, he's

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,180
not actually moving. He's not trying to
move towards us, despite the fact that

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,720
that's what we've told the system to do. We've said

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,600
chase me, and he is not chasing me right
now. So, the reason is, because there is no

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,870
Navmesh for him to follow. He does not
have a Navmesh, and there's actually a warning

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,630
along the bottom of the screen, saying
"Set destination can only be called on an

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,680
active agent that has been placed on a Navmesh". There is no Navmesh. So what

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,070
a Navmesh is, is a way of this Artificial Intelligence Agent

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,320
understanding enough about the world that it can actually navigate the

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,150
world. Alright, so we're going to set up our first Navmesh, right now. So, what you want to

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,380
do is click on the terrain, and we're going to open a new module, under Window, we have

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,490
Navigation. Now, for me that's over on the right. You can put it where you like, the

00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,790
right hand side is reasonable. And if
you're not selected on the terrain, say

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,209
you're selected on a light, it's going to
say select a mesh renderer or a terrain

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,720
from the scene. Ok so, I've selected a terrain. Now, we can leave all these settings as

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,280
they are for the moment,

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,190
and just go to the Bake Tab. And what you
need to do with a Navmesh is, you

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,280
actually need to create it offline here, in this case, before you run the

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,570
game, and then bake the Navigation Mesh onto the terrain. So, let's see

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,510
what that actually means. Some basic
settings the Agent Radius, half a meter is

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,560
about right. Agent Height 2 meters
is about right. Maximum Slope 45 is

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,190
about right. Step Height 40 centimetres, that's the maximum step that the agent can go up,

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,030
that's about right, and we don't worry
about these advanced settings for now.

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,640
So, we should just click Bake, with those settings. It's going to take a little while. You can

00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,460
see the progress, down on the bottom right. What it's doing now is it's exporting the terrain tiles, and

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,160
when it's finished doing that it's then going to start calculating the Navmesh. And then, in a

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,990
moment you'll see your whole terrain fill
up with some blue indications as to

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,640
where this guy can and can't go. Now, there are a lot more advanced things we can do with

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,660
Navmeshes. He can jump, he can drop, and he can even kind of go through a portal

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,130
to somewhere else, which is the Off Mesh Links. But for now, we're just focusing on

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,190
the real basics, which is the idea of a
simple Navmesh, and this could take

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,180
a while on your machine, it might be much quicker. I'm on a Quad Core i7 here on

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,169
a laptop, it could be much slower. So, that
might take you a while and when it's finished,

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:40,070
have a look around you're terrain, and
you will find that the blue areas are

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,610
where this guy is going to be able to
navigate to. Now, there's a limited draw

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,680
distance on these, so you may need to
get relatively close to see it in action.

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,250
And I'm using these First Person Control
Keys again W, S, A, D, while holding down the

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,710
right mouse button, and you can see the
areas of the terrain that he is able to navigate.

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:02,850
Cool hey! So, before we go any further, I want you to create your first Navmesh. Bake a

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,300
Navmesh into the terrain, preview it in your scene, adjust either the terrain or the

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,780
Navmesh settings, things like the
slope, until it's how you want it. And then,

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,919
share a screenshot of your baked Navmesh in the discussions. So, go ahead

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,529
pause the video and set up your Navmesh... your first version of your Navmesh now.

00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,009
Cool welcome back! So, I'm going to stick
with what we've got here for the moment,

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,029
and just check it works before the end
of this video. And then, we'll go

00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:37,769
from there. So, the way to check it works
is simply to play the game, and then go

00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,669
to the Scene View and look at this zombie guy. Now, there he goes, he's running.

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:44,519
Now, he's doing some weird stuff. If we look at him, he's kind of doing mad jumping around,

00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,399
but he is effectively running. Now, if he's
not behaving right, if he's doing jumps all

00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,069
the time like this jump jump jump, holding his arms up in the air looking like a loony, then

00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,629
the reason is you need to go to the
zombie, and you need to go to the

00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,769
Inspector for the zombie and one of his
settings in the Third Person Character

00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:04,929
Script is a Ground Check Distance. So, you want to change this Ground Check

00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:09,109
Distance, it's a check on distance
between the character and the ground,

00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:13,519
and you want to change it to something like 2 from 0.2, a nice big value. Now, let's look

00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,229
at the guy; double click on the zombie... in the Scene View remember, and you'll get a

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,109
quick look at how he's running across
the terrain. Now, you can follow him around,

00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:24,979
watching his Capsule Collider stay in
contact with the ground. Now, it's that

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,219
Capsule Collider, that capsule shaped inner collider that is going to stay in contact

00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:33,179
with the ground mesh, and there he goes, he's running along the terrain after us.

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,520
Let's go into the game, and you can maximize, during play by the way, by just clicking

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,459
here and then Maximize. And let's look
around, I'm actually, for the first time,

00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,679
feeling a little bit anxious. I know that
somewhere out there, there is a zombie running

00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:50,809
across the terrain chasing me. So, let's
see if we can see him. And this is what I

00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:54,109
want you to do, I want you to get to the point where the zombie actually chases you. Now,

00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:57,279
in case you've missed a bit of this
video, while we wait for him to be

00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,679
visible, where I showed you how to make
yourself the target, it's under the

00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:07,839
zombie itself in the third person... Well
sorry, in the AI Character Controller Script

00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,169
here, and the target, we make the target
the FPS controller us, and it

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:16,739
will continually chase us. Ok, so let's go back to the Scene View, find this zombie.

00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:21,249
How's he doing? He's running along the terrain after us. So, back in Game View let's

00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:26,409
maximize. Where is he coming from? Probably from the right, I'm not sure.

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,420
I'm slightly nervous that this guy is going to jump out on me in a minute,

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,380
and I don't know which direction from.
Now, I don't know if the scaling is going to be

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,430
right, when this zombie gets here. We may be far too big; he may be far too small.

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,320
We're going to worry about that in a
subsequent video. I just want to make sure

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,740
that he actually gets to me, because
that's a nice win. So, where is he

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:53,050
coming from? This is scary. Fun hey! For the first time, we are feeling a little bit

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,210
concerned. Oh, here he comes!

00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,990
Oh, I'm not worried, look at that poxy little
zombie. He's tiny but he stops when he

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,090
gets to us and patiently stands there with
his arms by his side. Not quite the

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,720
effect we're looking for, but we clearly
have a scaling issue going on. So, what

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,910
we'll do in the next video is deal with the
relative scaling between you and the

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,490
zombie, because at the moment he's not at all scary, at that height. So, see you soon! [Laughs]
