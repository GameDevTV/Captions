00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
Hey hey! In this video. we're going to awesome-ify you're scene lighting. So. I'm going to show you

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.559
how to move your scene view to your
character view. how to add fog to your

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.999
scene. add a lens flare to the sun. and
then add a flare layer to the FPS Controller Camera.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.130
That was Chinese for camera. Ok fantastic! So. let's get on with all of that. Firstly. let's

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.140
imagine that you want to work on the sun and the lighting. and that you want to do it

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.399
by standing here and looking in between these two trees. And you get yourself to this position and you go.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.340
well that's a cool place! Of course. if you stop playing or even move the mouse. you're going to lose

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.370
this position. So. Control or Command + Shift + P. to pause the game. and then you've got

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.870
this locked. Then. what you can do is. you
can go to your FPS Controller Camera

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:59.570
like that. Then. you can go to Game Object.
Once you're in the Scene View. you can go to GameObject.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.700
Align View to Selected. Ok. And then. that
means that the Scene View is now the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.409
same as that game view. as you left it. So.
that's a pretty handy tool for you. Ok. Let's

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.630
look at adding some fog to the scene.
to make this more ominous. In the Window

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.020
Menu under Lighting. now you've got a load
of scene lighting options in Unity 5.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.549
Now. it's asking for the sun. If you don't select a sun then. it would assume the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.450
brightest directional light you have is the
sun. but you may as well give it the sun

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.400
while you're there. It's only used for Procedural Sky Boxes. but I'm just setting it as I go past. The bit

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.520
we're looking at is fog. down here. so click Fog. I'm going to use Exponential

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.850
Fog. You can play with these differences.
it's a question of how fast the fog

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.590
comes on. as you go away from the camera. I'm going to go with Exponential Fog. of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.960
the strength .02. Ok. Then. if you look
at that. inside the Game View. you can see

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.600
we have a foggy landscape.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.380
Fantastic! So. what I want to do next to
improve the lighting is to add a lens

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.420
flare effect. Remember we're going to be
wearing a helmet. so we want to make it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.850
feel like we're kind of looking through
a lens. So. you need two things for that.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.930
you need to go to your Directional Light.
and then. add a lens flare. ok. to the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.310
light itself. Now. when you go and try and select a flare. there is none.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.940
and that's because it's in another asset
package. And the asset package you need

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.540
is the Effects Package. so import package
effects. Now. we only really need the lens

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.970
flare. but we don't know what the
dependencies are. So. I think that I'm

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.500
just going to go in and import the whole lot.
Now. your project might be getting rather

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.120
large by now. but hopefully you've got the space for it. This is the disadvantage of just

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.830
importing things willy nilly. but it does
speed things up and allow us to get

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.069
access to all of the cool fun bits on
Unity. So. now back on your Directional

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.920
Light. When you choose Lens Flare now. you'll have the option for a 50 millimeter zoom.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.959
A flare. small. the sun. etc. Now. before we choose it. let me show you something. In the Scene

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.989
View. you've got this little preview
option here. and at the moment it's

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.590
showing flares. And you want to make sure there's a tick box in there. Your game camera will not

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.130
show the flare. even when you've added it. yet. So. let's go to the Directional Light and

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.360
add in a flare. Now. you need to make it
directional. so click directional. Ahh. there it  is!

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.720
Now. you can play with the brightness. Go really silly or you can go not so silly.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.700
I'm going to make it quite strong. and you
can have different fade speeds. Well.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.180
that has no affect. the way we're using
it. Ok. so I've got a brightness of say 1.5.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.010
Directional Sunlight Flare. Now. do I want
sun. or do I want 50 millimetre zoom? I'm

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.690
going to go with the 50 millimetre zoom
here. because it has these extra light

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.030
camera effects. which is just a bit more fun.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.859
Ok. so I've got a 50 millimetre zoom flare. it's a white flare. with a 1.5 brightness. Now.

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.419
you'll notice if you go to the Game View and play and try looking at the sun. you don't see the flare.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.430
And the reason you don't see the flare
yet. is because the camera that you're looking

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.909
through on the FPS Controller does not
have a Flare Layer. It needs something

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.909
called a Flare Layer. for the camera to see it. It's got no settings Ok. but it's just a thing

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.000
that makes the camera process those flares in the scene.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.090
Now. when you look at the sun. look at that. and isn't this why you got Unity out of the box. in the first place?

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.440
Not that it comes in a box. Maybe it should come in a box?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.940
It would be much nicer if it came in a box! But look at that. the water. the sun flares. these camera effects. fog.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.780
Ahh. what more do you want? You see. now you've done all of the hard

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.479
work of understanding how to script
behavior in Unity. We've got ourselves in

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.099
a position where we can start playing
with this stuff confidently. knowing that

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.360
when we need to go under the scenes.
behind the scenes rather and start

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.570
actually making behavior work properly
that we have the coding skills to do so.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.009
So. well done getting yourself this far! Do
have a look at the other options in the

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.009
Lighting Panel. see if there's anything
else you want to change. But this stuff is

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:03.539
all quite detailed. like Maps and Precomputed Realtime Global Illumination. all this

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.280
type of stuff. Probably not stuff you
want to get yourself messing around with

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.660
right now. but just take a look for
inspiration. Take a look at the books if you like.

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.949
the little book. and do look up and see
what all this stuff means. at least on a

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.199
first pass. But the important thing that
you do right now. really is just tweak

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.070
your whole environment. Get it all how
you want it.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.729
Remember it will change when you play
test the game. Adjust the height of your

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.400
terrain. your textures. your details. your trees. your water. your lights. etc.. and just have

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.270
fun with it. And I'll see you on the other
side.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.509
Welcome back! So. I'm just going to have a
little tweak of my terrain and stuff now.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:46.110
Make sure that this is going to be reasonably good to play. or at least make sure that it looks

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.669
like it is. So. I'm going to look at it
from above... zoom right out. Now. because I

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.720
can't see what the hell's going on. I'm
going to go to Window and Lighting

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.090
and turn fog back off again. at least for
now. And then. I'm going to be able to see my

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.200
terrain. One of the things I would like in my terrain is more depressed areas where we can

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.910
have water. to try and make life a
little bit harder for these zombies when

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.070
they come chasing us. So. I'm just going to
randomly cut into the terrain here. It's going to

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:24.190
be a bit strange. Ok. And then. you may
want to have many more mountainous areas.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.800
I'm very very lean on mountainous
areas here. I might want to have some

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.090
sort of mountain range coming through. See I'm really just slapping it on here. and

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.850
I'm going to want you to spend a lot more
time doing this. The thing is. that I'm trying

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.650
to get the concepts across. and not all
of the... you know not spending absolutely

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.510
ages painting textures on here. etc. I do want to share a few general things with you.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.430
One is. remember use your terrain editing layout. if you want extra space. Secondly.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.200
as a general rule. when you're first
getting into terrains it's

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.090
useful to have this kind of half grassy
half rocky texture on any of your

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:07.100
vertical surfaces. with a reasonably
small brush. And then. what you can do is

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:15.130
you can just paint that on here. That one there. And you can just paint it on these rocky surfaces

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.530
quite roughly. And that can give quite a
useful effect. rather than having grass

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.740
just kind of disappearing up the sides
of everything. which looks really fake.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.110
You can do it pretty quickly actually. you
can slap that on in a pretty organic way.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.540
and just make these hills look a little
bit more natural. So. there's a tip for

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.800
you. if you're going around with your
terrain. paint this rocky texture on.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.420
You also want to get the muddy
texture and put that into various

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.410
places. I need to raise the terrain up here a little bit. because I've got a feeling the character

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.360
may be able to almost get out of there. Now. I'm finding on my machine that it's often

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.070
selecting onto a different terrain tool. If you're finding that. just be aware

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:57.340
of which tool you're selected on there. And
it's pretty cool isn't it. this ability to

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.610
just modify the terrain? And you can
always dive into your first person

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.930
character and have a look around in that.
or you can use the Fly Through Controls.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.670
which I'm using here. which I'm right
clicking and then using the

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:14.700
normal first person controls. WSAD. So. I can have a look at it from this guy's perspective. Obviously. I've got

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:27.440
some texturing to do over there still. So.
let's have a look.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:36.720
Here you go. just got a few more bits of the terrain that need painting. Fill in these

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.210
mountainsides here. a little bit. so that
they're not too grassy. On the bits that

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.900
can't be grassy. I think I need some more mud. Need more

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:55.940
muddy muddy areas. so you could have suggested muddy pathways. whatever. You can see that I'm

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.830
not taking a lot of pride in my terrain
here. and that's because it's really

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.720
difficult. I think for me. to get great
concepts across whilst painting a

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.920
terrain in. Obviously. there are a lot of
considerations for how you make this

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.950
look natural and feel good. And I think
that I'm going to iterate on this terrain.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:21.590
as I play the game and try and use things like mud to indicate maybe directions to

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.100
safe areas or dangerous areas and things
like that. I'm also starting to feel this

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.770
terrain is a bit small. but for the
purposes of teaching this section I

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.440
think it's going to be absolutely fine. Now.
remember you can place or remove

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.430
more trees. you can place or remove more
grass details. We have really not put

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.050
that much grass down on this terrain. so
I might paint a bit more. Remember. when

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.590
you're painting your grass that you're
not going to see it. unless you're within

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:50.680
the draw distance of the grass that we
talked about. Ok. there's not many of

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.320
these terrain settings you probably
want to be fiddling with. at the moment. You

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.350
could increase your terrain size. but it will
stretch all of your features. That's ok

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:03.230
let's just take a look at doing that. If
I go to say 1.000 by 1.000. you

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.070
see what it does. It stretches all the
features. and your water table will also get

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.110
stretched. Well. not get stretched. it will
stay where it is and needs to be moved

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.730
and resized. So. you could make your
terrain bigger. make all your hills a bit

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.920
smoother. it'll spread all your trees out.
That's fine. In fact. I'm going to do that.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:26.660
I'm going to go up to 1.000 by 1.000. Then. I'm going to move my water table to 500 by 500. I'm going to

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:34.720
resize the water table. doing that same
calculation again. which is 500 times 1.42 = 710.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:41.490
It needs to be in radius. like so. so it just reaches the edges. And then. I have a

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.500
slightly larger terrain. more spread out.
slightly smoother features. so that's

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.399
fine in this case. You can make a kind
of X and Y even scale change accepting that

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:55.519
it will just smooth out your terrain features. Ok. so I now have 1.000 by

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:59.740
1.000 terrain. which my machine still
seems to be coping with. And have a go

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.740
around with your character. Obviously your character's going to need to start in a

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.680
position that doesn't fall off the world. etc.
Later. we will deal with falling

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:14.550
through the world and all that sort of
business. So for now. enjoy getting your

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:20.639
character somewhere sensible. and then.
running around your own terrain. Here we go.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:27.339
Little puddles. You see how quickly you can get something vaguely acceptable? But be careful about the

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:31.850
slopes in your terrain. you see my slope is too much here. In fact. my character is a bit wet. he can

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:37.980
only go up 10 degree slopes. I'm going to
give him 20 degree slopes. especially as he can't jump.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.860
He's a bit crippled. otherwise. by his inability to move around the terrain. Ok that's cool! So. much bigger

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:49.180
terrain. 1.000 by 1.000 now. can't escape. plenty of different textures. We're well on the way.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.279
Let's just check that lens flare. Still looking great!

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:57.480
There it is. Cool! Alright! Congratulations! Go ahead. make your terrain beautiful. Find some

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.790
nice places in it. maybe maximize your
screen. and take us some screenshots.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:05.259
Make us all jealous. with how cool your
terrain is and how nice your lighting

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:08.980
and everything looks. Make mine look
really silly for me. I really would appreciate

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.269
that. Ok. Thanks very much guys. and I'll see you soon.
