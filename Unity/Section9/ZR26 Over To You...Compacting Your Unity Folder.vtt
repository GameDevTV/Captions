00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
Hey guys, welcome back! We're actually going to wind up this section now. That'll come as

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.400
a great relief to some of you, but a
disappointment to others but I'll

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.460
explain why. And we're going to be talking about compacting your Unity Folder, briefly. So firstly,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.369
we're going to talk about what we left out of this section and why. We'll be checking that our

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.160
project is tidy. I'll show you how to compact your Unity Folder, to save space. I'll show you how

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.269
to find our code on GitHub, at any stage
of our lectures, and then, we'll go over

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.050
to you. So, what we've left out, we've left
out Xbox controllers, because we're going to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.350
cover them in another section, where we're going to make better use of the two sticks

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.280
and the fact that they're analog. We've left out mini-maps, because they're quite a lot of work

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.480
to code, and there's lots of them available on the asset store. We've left out

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.530
enemy spawning, because it's been
covered in previous sections, such

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.480
as Glitch Garden in detail and it's pretty simple. We've even done it here with the player, so

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.289
why not use a similar thing? Do you
even want to spawn your enemies? Spawning is a bit

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.890
weird right? Maybe they just want to be
in the scene in the beginning, who knows? We've left

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.780
out helicopter landing, the detail of that, because it's simply

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.229
an animation, and I want to see what you
guys can do with that. As a tip here, you

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.979
may want about a minute out, to re-vector the helicopter, rather than heading just

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.070
randomly towards the play space, to
adjust its heading to head exactly at the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.310
landing area, but decide how you want to
land. Do you want to come overhead and do a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.740
vertical landing, which is dangerous if
you get an engine failure at low

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.799
altitude, or do you want the helicopter
to make a more standard flare landing?

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.280
I love to see what you do, please share it in the discussions. And weapon pickups,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.400
because we'll be covering that in another
section, about how to do pickups, in a

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.970
future section I'll be adding. Yes there's more to come, and you'll be able to apply this back

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.790
to this section. So, that's why we're not
covering those things there. Now, this

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.979
is my code repository. We'll be talking
about that more in a moment, but for now,

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.840
I want to dive into the Unity Project
here, and I want to have a little look at

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.930
a couple of things. Firstly, I want to go
through all of the hierarchy, etc., and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.200
I want to make sure that it's all tidy and
clean. So ok, so here we are, let's take a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.720
look through. So, the editor scripts came
in with the standard packages, so they're fine.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.540
The Game Folder, what's going on in here?
Well, traditionally we would call this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.130
the Scenes Folder, and under it we see we
have another Game Folder, which contains

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.360
another Navmesh. What's going on there?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.500
Well, we can delete this Navmesh
actually, and what happens is, Game is the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.700
name of the scene and when you bake the Navmesh, it creates a sub folder called

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.710
Game. So, let me make this clear, I'm going to rename my Games Folder to Scene. Yes, I did

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.270
just delete that Games Sub Folder, but
bear with me. Now, just watch it for a moment.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.420
Make a folder called Scenes right, and then, you've got in it a Level Definition or

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.120
a Scene Definition called Game. Fine and it has the terrain! Now, I may as well call the terrain game, as

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.959
well. So, it's this terrain for this
scene Ok. Now, if I bake now, which is

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.250
doing lots of pre-computation of the
Navigation Mesh, it's going to draw polygons

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.239
around trees and do a lot of work. That
means that when the AI agent, i.e. the zombie

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.820
comes to run at you, it's going to be much much faster at run-time, because of this

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.120
work it's doing now, and down on the bottom right, you can see the progress. And what you'll

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.130
find in a moment is, we'll create a sub folder in here, called the same as the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.590
scene, and the scene is called Game. So, it will expect to see a sub folder called game,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.769
there you go, and that contains the Navmesh. Ok, so that's what's going on with

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.580
those funny sub folders. Prefabs all look good and the scripts are all fine and the standard

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.220
assets are there, but bear in mind they're
quite large and we'll talk about

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.280
compacting your folder down in a moment. And then, the start pack is also quite large.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.660
So, let's right click Standard Assets, and
I'm going to show this in Finder. It's a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.420
very similar thing in Windows. The standard assets that we've imported

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.870
total 158 and make a fair amount, but there's also other

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.549
things in here that we can reduce the
size of. So, if we go back to the Zombie Runner

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.390
Level, you'll notice that with practically all of your Unity projects

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.940
you have a load of stuff in the root, at
least a user press file, but potentially

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.840
a load of other stuff as well. CM Proj...

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.760
sorry project files and all sorts of
other stuff at the root, and then, you

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.240
will also have a Project Settings Folder
and a Assets Folder and a Library Folder and a Temp

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.090
Folder. Look you can tidy up your hierarchy here, you only need the Assets

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.910
Folder and the Project Settings Folder,
all of the rest of the stuff can go.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.540
I'm not going to delete it, because my
Code Management Tool, which I'll show you in

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.889
a moment, automatically ignores this
stuff, but if you want to compact your

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.840
folder down, you can safely delete your
Library Folder and every other file in

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.830
the root of here, just to let you know. Ok, and then, it will be rebuilt when you next open

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.840
Unity. So, you're welcome to save your
project and have a go at that. Ok, now I'm

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.160
going to show you our final thing, which is
how to find the code for all of our

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.770
projects. So, if I save what I've got here and then, I go over to something

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.389
called Source Tree, which is a visual
tool for Git source management... And

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.410
we will talk about this, probably in a
separate course possibly at the end of

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.830
this course, in a while, but this is
very useful for you as a student, even if

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.080
you don't understand Git, and even if you don't have an account on Git, because when I've

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.430
finished every lecture, like I just did...
Let me just show you a little bit behind

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.669
the curtain, as to what I do. I come along
here and I add everything that has

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.440
changed, that I just did in that lecture. I
commit it and I commit it with a name,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:52.320
that is the name of the lecture that
we're currently working on. So, in this case that is this,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.060
"Compacting Your Unity Folder". Ok, and
then, what that means you end up with if

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.440
we go to the Git Hub website, even as an
anonymous user where you don't

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:12.280
have an account then, look at this if you
go github.com/CompleteUnityCreator

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.200
then... What have I done here?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.479
Oh, CompleteUnityCreator is what I meant to type! Ok, here we go!

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:25.499
CompleteUnityDeveloper! Oh, it's late at night and I'm trying to get this finished for you guys. Ok!

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.700
So, github.com/CompleteUnityDeveloper

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.820
If you click on a section, say Zombie Runner, you'll see the latest code available, and you can

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.310
download it as .zip. Notice that the library file is not there

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.310
Ok, and neither are any other files in the root, apart from stuff to do with Git.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.880
And then, if I go to 24 Commits or the number of commits at the top left here, what this

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.230
will give you is a snapshot of our project at the end of every single video,

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.860
literally named the file of the video. So, if I was to click here, "Scaling Your

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.450
Characters", that one earlier in the section, and say "Browse the repository at

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.250
this point in history", now I get
something that looks very similar, but it's

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.750
actually the state of our project at the
end of that video. And you can click

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.710
Download ZIP and you can get it and
inspect what we've done. So, hopefully

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.110
that's useful to you. You may want to
follow me on GitHub, github.com/BenTristem

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.660
and you follow me, and you can
see all the commits to all of my

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.230
projects the Unity, the Blender, the Game
Physics, anything else I do. Ok!

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.960
So, that's a little look behind the scenes at code management, and I just wanted to let you

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.780
know you can get to all our things there.
Now, it's over to you with Zombie Runner!

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.750
So, I want to wean you off holding your hand, Ok. I've stopped

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.290
building user interfaces in Bowl Master, but that doesn't mean that

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.380
you should stop. It means that you should
do exactly what some of our students

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.790
have done and create your own unique interface. I want you to make the zombie spawn,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.330
that's already covered in Glitch Garden. It's already pretty easy to do, so I want

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.810
you to do that for yourself. Create a
spawning strategy or no spawning, maybe

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.000
just position a bunch of zombies in the
game. And make the helicopter landing, so

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.930
the helicopter currently is going to arrive at the edge or in the middle of

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.210
the scene, depending on how you've set it up. You may, at about one minute out, want to

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.040
arrange for the helicopter to head towards the landing area. That's something you're

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.030
plenty capable of doing now. Create a
user interface. Please take

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.390
the time to do this one. Make something
that's sympathetic to this game. Share it in

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.700
the discussions, I really want to see what
you create. And then, change the zombie

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.040
mesh to some free asset perhaps or
something you've made from the

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.000
asset store or your own creation. So
basically, make it your own and finish the

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.300
game. I want you getting into the habit of
finishing the game. My job is to finish the

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.720
course; your job is to start finishing
games. So, please take the time to finish

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.329
Zombie Runner, and once we have learned new things, in future sections,

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:41.339
then come back to Zombie Runner and continue to improve it Ok. Hopefully, one of you will make

00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:46.629
this into a game that you can share on
the iOS or Android store.

00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:49.089
So, congratulations getting this far in the
course! Crack straight on with the

00:08:49.089 --> 00:08:53.489
next section, and let's keep the momentum up, as soon as it's available. See you soon!
