00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,970
Hey guys welcome back! In this video
we'll be exploring humanoid animation a

00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,590
little further. So, an overview of how Ethan is actually animated. We'll be

00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,160
talking about re-targeting animations,
introducing blend trees, and while I'm there,

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,350
I'm going to tell you what Inverse Kinematics is, because you'll see a little IK button,

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,180
and I'm sure your curiosity will get the
better of you otherwise. So, let's

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,840
just take a look at how Ethan is actually animated. It all starts, of course,

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,890
with Ethan's third person animator controller, which is here in the Inspector, if you

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,760
click on Zombie, and then, click on
the Controller. So, there it is, let's...

00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,940
I'm going to put it down on the bottom, I'm just more used to it there. You put it wherever you like.

00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,539
And I'm going to take a look. It's got three
fundamental states, ignoring the entry

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,910
state here, which actually we could move these across couldn't we. And we wouldn't have to keep scrolling

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,039
around and giving you seasickness. So, you've got a grounded state, but it's actually got

00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,770
a sub-state machine and then, an airborne
state and a crouching state. They've done

00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:03,809
a lot of work for you Unity, in providing
this. Here you see this IK sticking up here,

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,640
Inverse Kinematics. I'll explain what that is in a bit. So, the overview is that he can be on the

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,700
ground, in the air, or crouching, and there are various transition criteria for this, to

00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,939
do with parameters. OK, so what I want to
show you, really in this video, is

00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:23,159
the preview down at the bottom here, that
you've got, now you've seen this

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,009
before and you've seen that you can click Preview. And this is previewing this transition, going

00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:34,159
from crouching to grounding. I also want
to show you that when we go into an animation,

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,340
this is using something called a Blend Tree, and what this means is there's a whole bunch

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,630
of different animation states for Ethan here. He's got a whole load of different

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,689
things, and what you see with this Blend
Tree, at the top firstly, is a State Space.

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:52,000
It's a whole bunch of different animations he could be in. He's got about 20

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,140
animations, between walking left and
right and sharp walking, etc.

00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,280
And they're all specified down here, and this X and Y position is just where it's plotted

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,300
on this graph above. OK, and this is how fast the animation is played.

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,690
And what the Blend Tree does for us is it
allows us to combine animations together,

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,710
so if I do a preview down here, you can
see that down here, this has selected the

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:20,210
Idle Animation, and another way of moving
between these is to move the parameters

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,340
that have been set up. So, this is how
far forward your stick would be pressed,

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,340
for example, on an Xbox controller, and then, this bit would represent how far left and

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,920
right your stick is being moved. So, you can either explore the state space here, or you can

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,030
actually just grab the red dot, up in the
Inspector, and move around. And this is

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,860
very much like you would see, when you
start moving your control around, as I

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,640
say. So, this is a fantastic system for
combining different animations together.

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,420
So, that is an introduction to Blend
Trees. It's simply a question of adding a

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,960
Blend Tree, adding in all the different
animations you want, putting them in

00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,400
different positions on the diagram, and
then, letting Unity do the blending

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,270
between them for you. It's pretty cool
and pretty clever, and you can see

00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,930
just how much work they have to do, to
acknowledge the fact that turning left

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,750
and turning right or walking left and walking right is different, doing that

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,830
in a sharp, rapid way. They have to do a
different animation for that, because of

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,600
the way the body sways, etc.

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,739
Now, we'll look at the actual animations in a second, before we do I just want to show

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,100
you how you can re-target animations. If
you click the Avatar, down here, you could

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,900
choose the Unity model, this dude here,
and he will take exactly the same motions.

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,690
One of the cool things about animations is,
you can put them on any humanoid

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,550
character, any character with the same
rigging, with the same bone structure,

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,860
you can put this same animation on, it could be an orc or a person. And you can go back

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,100
to Auto, and if it doesn't bring it up on
Auto, you can always just go to other, and

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,970
then, explicitly choose the game object
that you want to use, say Ethan here, for the

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,920
preview. OK, this thing here just turns on
and off this little access, which

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,660
shows you the direction he's facing. Now, the other thing I just wanted to introduce you to is Inverse

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,760
Kinematics. What's Inverse Kinematics? Well, it's often used on the feet.

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,560
For example, normally when you animate
you move forward down the Hierarchy, so

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,570
if we were to look at this zombie and zoom in to him, let's give myself some more

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:18,040
space right now, and then, maybe zoom right in to his shoulder... Now by the way, thank you to

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,250
Elijah for pointing out that, if you get
bored of clicking these little expansion

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,560
icons, you can hold down the Alt key on
your keyboard, I'm holding down Alt now, and

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,140
then click it and it'll do a full
expansion. And that would let us get to

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,090
his shoulder, for instance, a bit quicker, although you'd end up being vomited on by the Hierarchy.

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,360
And Forward Kinematics is this, it's when we move say an arm from this end, that's

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,570
Forward Kinematics. So, if I want to get the
hand to a certain position, I've got to move

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,680
the arm up, and then, I've got to go to the
forearm and move that and so on. It's great

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,340
for that type of movement, but how about he wants to put his hand on a wall and keep it

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,220
there or put his foot on the ground and
keep it there?

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,640
Well, Inverse Kinematics is doing
calculations to say, well actually I'm

00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,780
going to specify where the end of the
limb is, say the hand, and then, I'm going

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,570
to want the computer to work out
backwards what the limits of motion of

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,730
the rest of the body are, if the hand
were say glued to a table or the foot was

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:13,090
glued to the floor. So, that's just an
overview of when you see IK,

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,190
Inverse Kinematics in here. That's what
it's talking about.

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,120
OK, and you can see it making a minor
change here with the feet. Again, a little bit beyond

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,650
the scope of this course to get into that
level of detail about animation. Maybe you want to

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,840
check out my Blender course, later on in
there, if you want to get into that

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,230
detail. Animation is a completely different art, and we've got to have a lot of

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,070
respect for the guys who are spending a
huge amount of time putting these

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,250
animations together. So, we've talked
about an overview of how Ethan is animated,

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,900
re-targeting animations, how you could apply these to different things. You've got an

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,680
overview of Blend Trees, by the way, there are also Blend Trees for his airborne state.

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,850
So, if we click into here, you can now see
that when airborne he can jump

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,340
off the left leg or the right leg, and one of
the easiest ways to see that is to look

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,130
at this. This is deciding how far through the
jump animation he is, and this guy is deciding

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,640
whether he has jumped off the left leg or the right leg. And then, by cycling the run

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,870
appropriately, he can do

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,860
realistic-looking jumps.  A lot of work hey! A lot of work, and there's a similar thing

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,520
for crouched animations. So, the final
thing really, I want to show you is just how

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,290
much work there is in the key framing of
this guy. If I bring up a separate window here,

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,340
click on Ethan, I'm going to go back to that
Animation Window. Look at this! It's nuts!

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,199
So, this is just for the idle animation. This is just the idle, it's got

00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,479
all of these key frames. It's absolutely
crazy, it takes a huge amount of work, and

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,090
this is your Stand Quarter Right,

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,760
your Humanoid Jump Mid-Air, it's quite simple that one. But look at Idle, for example; look how many different

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,630
key-frames we've got, for how many
different body parts.

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,940
And then, you could go into the curves, as well, and see it diagrammatically. Now, that's not unusual for

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,560
animating a character. You know, Disney films would use something like that as well, with

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,330
even more. So yeah! It's impressive! It's an art form, in its own right!

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,120
Absolutely, it's a huge amount of work to
get it right, but Unity supports it, is

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,340
the bottom line here. It's really really
powerful, allowing you to animate, and

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,350
then, it'll blend between these
animations for you. So, back to Unity!  Anything

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,440
else to tell you? One more thing about
Ethan, his animation is augmented by a

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,610
Third Person Character Script here, and
you'll see it's also taking in some

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,840
additional parameters about how he
animates, Moving Turn Speed, Jump Power,

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,560
Gravity Multiplier. And if you go into that script, you'll better see how that works.

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,860
There's a variety of set up at the start here,
and then, he's doing things like the

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,880
move. He's modifying the way it moves, applying extra rotation, when he turns to give some

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,740
momentum. Scaling his capsule for
crouching, those sort of things, you need

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,419
to be thinking about. So, if he's going to be in a crouch state, then his Capsule Collider needs to

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,289
be smaller, and then, you need to decide
on things like can he stand, when he's in

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,710
low headroom. So, these are the sort of
things where you need to be casting a

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,190
sphere, for example, which we haven't
covered yet, but this is similar to

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,220
detecting collisions, to say: Look can I
stand up here or can I not stand up here? So, in

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,419
totality and in summary, to animate a
humanoid properly you need animation

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,470
state machines, you need sometimes a
variety of different transition criteria.

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,729
So, for example, going from grounded to...

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,740
Let's have a look at one of these, here you go. From airborne to grounded has multiple

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,539
criteria, it depends on whether he's on
the ground or whether or not he's jumping

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:25,069
down, or the down animation is at a certain parameter value. You're going to

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:29,120
need Blend Trees, in order to make
realistic blends between different

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,810
motions, otherwise your going to get very
unnatural looking animation, and then

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:40,060
finally, once you've set up thousands of
key-frames, literally thousands of

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,860
key-frames, over in your animator... By the
way, this animation only lasts about 2 seconds,

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,240
2.1 seconds I think it is. The final thing
you need to do, is to be modifying

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,980
the animations with script. Now, the great
thing is that for third person and for first

00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,790
person, not that there's so much animation involved in the first person, but at least

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,290
for third person you can use Ethan as a
starting point, because we can re-target

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,970
this animation to a completely different
skin. If you decide to go over here and

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,550
look for, I don't know, zombie. I don't know if there are any free zombies in the Asset

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,769
Store, but of course if you do a search there and you find an appropriately rigged zombie, you

00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,959
could pull that in and then, apply that
mesh and have the same animations going

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,720
on. So, you've got a little bit of ammunition now, to go off and customize

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,579
Ethan. If you do know how to 3D model, then do it. If you want to go and find or

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,889
even buy a good zombie, I mean there's
one here, but I can't recommend it in the

00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:35,019
course, because it's paid for but it's
probably a good asset.

00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:38,930
You probably want to go and look on the asset store, and if you want to either

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,370
buy or find yourself a good zombie great!
I'm trying to teach you the basic

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,430
principles here. We've had such great
results from people, in Bowl Master, making

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,639
their own games without too much
guidance, and I want to start weaning you

00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:55,619
off me giving you every single asset and
every single idea about user interface, etc.

00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,800
By the way, have you built your user interface for this game yet, because remember at the beginning,

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,149
I said if you don't build it early then
you won't build it at all?

00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:06,610
Then, in Bowl Master, we stopped building UI or any significant menu system. And I

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,550
wonder how many of you are actually still
building your user interfaces, because just

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,920
because I've stopped doing it, to wean you off, you need to keep building menu systems.

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,240
So, enjoy customizing Ethan, and I'm going to continue with the logic of the game now, and we will come back

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,580
