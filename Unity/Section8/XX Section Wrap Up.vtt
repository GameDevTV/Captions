00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
Congratulations on finishing your very
first 3d game in Unity.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.490
How did you get on? Did you rise to
Brice's challenge? Brice what was your

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.059
challenge at the beginning so my challenge
was for you to create instead of bowling

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:11.719
pins

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.109
garden gnomes, I want to be bowling down and
knock down garden gnomes instead of normal

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.970
bowling pins so if you've been
creative, if you've either drawn your own

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.250
textures or created your own 3d objects I
totally wanna see that, don't forget to

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.140
share whatever version you create
however original or different your

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.780
version is, I definitely want to see it shared
on GameBucket.io and then we can see it and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.579
then other students can see it... Ben
you've loved the other games of other

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.420
students right already? Yeah I mean on the
other course on the 2d course and already

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.579
in this course we're starting to see
amazing sharing, so please be one of

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.579
those people who're bold enough to share
your game and get some feedback it's a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.539
safe community here everybody else is in
the same boat, so please at least share

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.180

discussions and if you're feeling really

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.590
