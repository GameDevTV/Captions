Hey guys and girls, just a quick video from me

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to say, well done and carry on! I

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
know that at this stage in the course, these videos are quite long

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the topic is quite complete, but please bear with us,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm trying to keep these as concise as I can. There's

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
just a lot to cover and you're about to dive into

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
a sequence of two videos, that cover basically the same

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
thing, because it's quite a large lump. But after another five

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or six videos, the average lecture length is going to start

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
dropping again and the going will get a little bit easier. So

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
literally, I've just dived in to break up this large section of

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
long videos and say, well done! This is great

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
stuff you're learning here! I'm seeing the results in the discussions,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
please persists with it. If you're really struggling,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
remember there's always the strategy of

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
just overviewing the content, kind of rushing through it or just watching

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
it the first time and then coming back and doing it,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
filling in every bit of detail. Remember, you can overview,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then in view to all the details, and then, review.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I certainly have had a tendency, in the past, to want to read a book from the beginning

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to end, like you'd read a novel so you don't ruin it,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but of course, with learning it's actually better

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
sometimes to overview the map, like you would do

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the outside of a jigsaw puzzle, before you go in and fill in

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the details. So, do just watch some videos without doing anything,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
if you feel like a break and then come back, or just plow on, but either way,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
congratulate yourself! You're doing great! And I'll see you back in the

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,200
videos!
