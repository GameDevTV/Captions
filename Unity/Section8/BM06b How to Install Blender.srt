00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Hi. welcome back. In this video we are going
to show you how to install Blender. So Blender

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:16.219 align:middle line:90%
is a 3D art program. it lets you manipulate
meshes. textures. animations and much more.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Why do we need it? We need it to import .blend
files we're going to be providing you with

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:90%
the pin for example. the bowling pin as a
.blend file. It's amazingly powerful but tricky

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.489 align:middle line:90%
to get started with. you only need to install
it for this course. not use it. If you want

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.789 align:middle line:90%
to know more go to www.CompleteBlenderCreator.Com
to learn more.

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.679 align:middle line:90%
So that's the summary basically it's a pretty
simple job this video. we just want you to

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:46.659 align:middle line:90%
go to Blender.org. pick the right version
for your machine. install it then close the

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.719 align:middle line:90%
program. before you get scared of its interface.
then test that it's working in the next video

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.389 align:middle line:90%
by importing the pin as we show you how to
do. So good luck with that. now go ahead and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:03.289 align:middle line:90%
install Blender on your machine now. pause
the video. Fantastic. welcome back. how did

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:90%
you get on with that? So I'm going to install
Blender in front of you just to help out in

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
case you have any issues.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:90%
So right now the Blender homepage looks like
this but this background image will change

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:90%
a lot and the structure of their page will
change so when you watch this video it may

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:90%
look different from this. So. 2.74 is the
version at this time. it doesn't really matter

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:90%
which version you use I'm pretty confident
that whichever version you use. as long as

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:90%
it's 2.7 or later you'll be fine. So. you
click on download and then obviously you go

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:90%
and find the version which is relevant to
your platform. In my case that's Mac OS and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
it's a bit funny but right now you just click
on this download here. or you go and specifically

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:90%
find yourself a mirror in the USA. Germany
or the Netherlands.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to click the cloud. because
I'm scared of choosing a mirror. Now do consider

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:90%
donating to Blender. it's completely free
and open source software and they can't keep

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:90%
it at this amazing quality without some donations.
so we are strongly considering donating 5%

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:90%
of our current Blender Kickstarter to this
foundation but in the meanwhile please consider

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.659 align:middle line:90%
donating if you like Blender; but for now
the purpose is just to install it. that's

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.439 align:middle line:90%
all we're trying to do here is get it installed.
So once the Blender zip file has finished

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.519 align:middle line:90%
downloading then go ahead and install it as
you do on your platform on a Mac you just

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
drag it into applications.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.209 align:middle line:90%
In the case of a PC you may need to just go
through a standard install process. Open Blender.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.109 align:middle line:90%
is the main thing we need you to do here.
there it is. it's going to give you a splash

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:90%
screen. something like that. and the interface
will look pretty much identical on Mac and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.549 align:middle line:90%
PC. Now you don't need to go any further than
this. we actually don't need you to know how

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.579 align:middle line:90%
to use Blender at all. you can quite safely
close Blender right now and carry on to the

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.739 align:middle line:90%
next video without any fear or problems whatever
because now that it's installed you'll find

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.959 align:middle line:90%
that over in Unity you will be able to actually
open from our start pack the Blender imports

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:90%
like the bowling pin. In fact if you were
to go to Unity and double click your bowling

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.749 align:middle line:90%
pin you should find it pops up in Blender
like this. which is cool. so you actually

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.439 align:middle line:84%
have everything that you need right now.

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.609 align:middle line:90%
If you just want to know a tiny bit more about
Blender I'm not going to go into much detail

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.709 align:middle line:90%
at all. that's what the complete Blender creator
is for but if you want a tiny bit more detail

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.579 align:middle line:90%
then stay on this video right now and I'll
show you the most important thing that I know

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.099 align:middle line:90%
about Blender which is roughly how this crazy
interface works. So here we go. what is it

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:90%
about Blender's interface that is so hard
to get hold of? You have file up here and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:90%
then view down here and then view again here.
what the hell is going on?

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.029 align:middle line:90%
Let me just show you the overall structure.
You have multiple editor types indicated so

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:38.459 align:middle line:90%
then here we have our self one editor type.
it's a 3D editor type. Down here is another

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.249 align:middle line:90%
one. which is a... so this is a 3D view. you
can see from the icon. this one here is an

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:49.639 align:middle line:90%
information editor type. this one here is
a timeline. So they're all kind of overlaid

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.949 align:middle line:90%
on top of each other and to add insult to
injury if you go to a division between sections

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.489 align:middle line:90%
and you try and drag. if you drag in the wrong
place you end up duplicating your interface.

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Now that's really confusing. but what you've
actually got here is you've just got another

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:90%
3D editor. you could change that to a graph
editor. so it's completely customisable which

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.659 align:middle line:84%
is the great thing about it.

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.919 align:middle line:90%
Now to control where your editors are what
you need to know about is that you have to

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.590 align:middle line:90%
grab this little grippy thing. and provided
you have the same number of editors in the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:90%
space that you're trying to drag into you
can over-write what's there. So this guy here

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:90%
will be able to over-write the one above.
this guy here will be able to over-write the

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:90%
one below in theory. if I grab and drag right.
there you go and the same here. I just need

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:90%
to grab right. there you go. so we're over-writing
the other pane. and then this main pane will

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:90%
be able to over-write the pane on the right.
you see and even the top pane will be able

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
to over-write the one below.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:90%
So if you understand that logic. and that
you'll always be able to change the editor

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%
type here. it's actually completely configurable
- we're just looking at the pin from inside

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:90%
right now. So remember that you change the
editor type here and that you need these little

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:90%
draggy things here and if you're really stuck
and you need to bring up another menu or header

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:90%
bar click the little plus icons that you'll
see. OK that's a brief overview of Blender.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:90%
that's all that I need to show you for now.
the rest of this course of course focuses

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:90%
on Unity 3D and as I say. if you're curious
go to www.CompleteBlenderCreator.com where

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%
we're going to work the same magic for Blender
as we do for Unity. See you soon.
