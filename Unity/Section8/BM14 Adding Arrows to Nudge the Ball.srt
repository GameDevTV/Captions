
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, so now we're going to add some
arrows so we can nudge the start position

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,969 align:middle line:90%
of the ball. We'll add another UI panel at
the bottom of the screen; ensure that this

00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:18,140 align:middle line:90%
panel occludes the touch input panel, so that
we are either moving left or right or we are

00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,130 align:middle line:90%
starting our drag so there's no confusion;
add two arrows for moving the ball left and

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:28,279 align:middle line:90%
right and write a simple method to allow this
moving of the ball only at the start. So let's

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,579 align:middle line:90%
start off with this UI panel, I'll get you
going and then I'd like you to tweak it and

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,320 align:middle line:84%
finish it.

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,340 align:middle line:90%
So to reinforce our learning here around these
panels, I'm going to put another panel here

00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,579 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom. So let's take a look here at
our UI. First I'm noticing that my left hand

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:47,550 align:middle line:90%
panel here is not snapped into the space here
so if I just drag I can snap to the bottom

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,079 align:middle line:90%
like that that's great. So while I'm here
this would be a good time to make sure that

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,920 align:middle line:90%
both panels are the same width, so let's say
a hundred and eighty pixels, and if you see

00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,559 align:middle line:90%
a really weird figure like this, something
with an e minus six that means ten to the

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,400 align:middle line:90%
minus six; 0.000006 that's tiny. Basically
that means zero so set it to zero, same as

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,350 align:middle line:84%
the top position.

00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,810 align:middle line:90%
Now if it won't actually snap to zero that's
fine but I just want to let you know what

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,090 align:middle line:90%
this e means in here. It's a tiny number,
it's called standard form. So 180 pixels,

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,799 align:middle line:90%
0, that's fine, and let's again snap that
to the right. Alright, so we're ready to put

00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:30,820 align:middle line:90%
another panel in here. So UI canvas, gameobject,
UI and panel, that's what we're trying to

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,670 align:middle line:90%
do right there like that and there comes a
big panel. Now as long as you're in this UI

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,549 align:middle line:90%
edit mode or the 't' key you're going to be
able to move and snap this UI panel to the

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,210 align:middle line:84%
bottom here.

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,950 align:middle line:90%
I love the way that the UI system works, so
let's double click on it. That'll focus it

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,970 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be able to take a little more of
a look. So great, we have that panel there

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,420 align:middle line:90%
let's call it arrows and now the order in
the hierarchy we will talk about in a minute.

00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,070 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to put it under touch input but
this is going to affect what gets clicked

00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,850 align:middle line:90%
first so let's get the rest of that general
structure right and then we'll worry about

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,830 align:middle line:90%
that. So if you look in your assets pack in
your start pack then you will find that I

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,410 align:middle line:90%
have updated the start pack recently and you
will find that if you go to Import package

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:23,540 align:middle line:90%
/ custom package and then point it to the
start pack then anything that's not already

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,599 align:middle line:90%
in it will show up like this and there'll
be an arrow.png.

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,230 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead and import that arrow from the
start pack and then if you look at that arrow

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,650 align:middle line:90%
let's take a look, how's it come in has it
come in as a sprite or a texture for you?

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,720 align:middle line:90%
Well whatever it has come in as we want it
to be a sprite 2D and UI sprite under the

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,209 align:middle line:90%
texture type. So just set that there, that's
great. Now so we have arrows, what we want

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:53,440 align:middle line:90%
to do on the arrows panel is have two images,
left and right, maybe here and here for these

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,959 align:middle line:90%
two different arrows. So create a sub-object,
gameobject / UI / image like that and if it

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,489 align:middle line:90%
doesn't already sub itself to arrows then
drag it under arrows. Call one of them right

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,819 align:middle line:90%
and then the image itself you can see it here,
it has the wrong sprite so give it the arrow

00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,720 align:middle line:84%
sprite.

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,280 align:middle line:90%
We're nearly there, we need this to be inside
this panel and sensibly sized so let's double

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,209 align:middle line:90%
click to focus on it, careful of the pivot
point drag the right thing, the whole thing

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,239 align:middle line:90%
that's it. We're actually going to put mine
around here now, in terms of positioning these

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,760 align:middle line:90%
arrows left and right if you click on them
and hold down shift as it says here there's

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,459 align:middle line:90%
set pivot we want the pivot to be central
because that way this position in x if you

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:42,010 align:middle line:90%
look in the inspector is the number of pixels
from this centre point. So let's say it's

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,680 align:middle line:90%
50 pixels from the centre point, something
like that.

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,129 align:middle line:90%
That means that when we put the left arrow
in which I'm going to do by duplicating the

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:56,000 align:middle line:90%
right arrow and calling one left - now as
a hint we can use a negative x scale - a scale

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,569 align:middle line:90%
of minus 1 like we did in glitch garden to
turn that arrow around then we rough drag

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,090 align:middle line:90%
it to where we want it to be; but because
our pivot point is central we can actually

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,720 align:middle line:90%
precisely position it by just saying minus
fifty there. I hope that that makes sense.

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,280 align:middle line:90%
The final thing that we can do with both the
left and the right element there is make them

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,290 align:middle line:84%
scale like this.

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,019 align:middle line:90%
Stretch in both x and y and the effect that
that will have is to, when you click play

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,590 align:middle line:90%
and look at this game window, let's maximise
on play actually, we want to make sure that

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,500 align:middle line:90%
this bottom panel is behaving itself so as
far as I'm concerned that is not behaving

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,520 align:middle line:90%
itself right now, you see how big these arrows
are and how this bottom panel is the wrong

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,800 align:middle line:90%
size? There you go, started behaving now,
but this is going to be your challenge. I'm

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,530 align:middle line:90%
going to do it after the challenge, but your
challenge is to finish off setting up the

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,759 align:middle line:90%
UI panel because again, no good just watching
me right?

00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:51,830 align:middle line:90%
So get the arrows panel finished. Get scaling
how you want it; set anchor and pivot points.

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,889 align:middle line:90%
Wire up to a method in the drag start script
called move start to a particular place so

00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:03,180 align:middle line:90%
the signature is MoveStart(float xNudge) and
that method in DragStart.cs should only log

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,900 align:middle line:90%
to the console for now the position that you
are going to be moving to. Don't actually

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,110 align:middle line:90%
do anything else with it and then ensure that
this doesn't conflict with your swipe gesture

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,110 align:middle line:90%
when you click on an arrow you should be logging
MoveStart right or MoveStart left.

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,720 align:middle line:90%
So before you do that challenge just let me
show you what I mean by that; we're going

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,220 align:middle line:90%
to have an event system, again on our arrows
panel, and then; sorry on each of our left

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,039 align:middle line:90%
and right arrows we're going to have a new
event system, remember how we had that before,

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,039 align:middle line:90%
event trigger and then that's going to call
a method on drag start - on the ball and set

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,139 align:middle line:90%
an amount to nudge left or right, maybe positive
five on the right arrow and negative five

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,830 align:middle line:90%
on the left arrow or something, that's what
I mean by that. That's what I want you to

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,250 align:middle line:90%
finish setting up now, is the arrows panel,
but without actually writing the rest of the

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,430 align:middle line:90%
MoveStart method. Pause the video, have ago
at that now, and see if you can get it logging

00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:01,229 align:middle line:90%
out plus five and minus five when you click
the arrows.

00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:06,410 align:middle line:90%
OK welcome back, so let's take a look at what's
up with this panel. So back in the scene view

00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,090 align:middle line:90%
firstly the arrows panel itself, how is it
stretching and scaling versus how do we want

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,090 align:middle line:90%
it to stretch and scale? Well I think that
we want it to be tied to the bottom of the

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,590 align:middle line:90%
screen and stretching like so, you see this
one here? I think that that's the stretching

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:28,160 align:middle line:90%
mode that we want, let's take a look. Now
the panel is looking half sensible. The panel

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,919 align:middle line:90%
itself is fine, you see the panel working
nicely? What aren’t working nicely right

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,949 align:middle line:84%
now are the arrows inside that panel.

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:40,009 align:middle line:90%
So they look OK at this scale, just about,
but they don't look so clever at other scales.

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:44,500 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on with our arrows? It's just
a question of working out what their scaling

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,759 align:middle line:90%
rules are. So we had them stretching, but
is stretching doing the trick? Is that working

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,220 align:middle line:90%
how we want them to? Maybe not, maybe they
just need to be relative to the centre. It's

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,650 align:middle line:90%
a question of experimenting with these things.
Before I fine adjust them let's take a look

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,940 align:middle line:90%
at that and see if that behaves better; yeah
I would say that that is better.

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah so the arrows just need a fine adjustment
of size and shape. So we've settled on an

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,210 align:middle line:90%
anchor of centre for the left and right arrows.
So I'm just going to resize these arrows a

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,750 align:middle line:90%
little bit like this, I may as well remember
the width and the height, or I can just copy

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,669 align:middle line:90%
the component values once I'm happy with it
so I could put this one here for example,

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:31,000 align:middle line:90%
copy component I could go to the left arrow,
paste component values, when I do that of

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,800 align:middle line:90%
course it's going to sit right on top of this
component arrow so I need to make the two

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,259 align:middle line:90%
changes. Minus one for the x scale to switch
it round, and then of course the x position

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,830 align:middle line:84%
also needs to be minus compared to the centre.

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,610 align:middle line:90%
So there's an example of how you get perfectly
positioned thingies. Cool so now on our ball

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,199 align:middle line:90%
remember we have a DragLaunch script. I said
we wanted a new method called move start so

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,069 align:middle line:90%
public void MoveStart (float amount) now it's
not going to do the move for now, it's just

00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:06,250 align:middle line:90%
going to Debug.Log ball moved and then add
in the amount. That's what I said we should

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,090 align:middle line:90%
do in the challenge. SO you make a public
void MoveStart taking in a number of pixels

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:17,949 align:middle line:90%
to move which means that our right arrow can
have added to it an event trigger just like

00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,740 align:middle line:84%
we did before;

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:29,169 align:middle line:90%
and when we say pointer down it's going to
look at the ball, find its DragLaunch method

00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,300 align:middle line:90%
and call MoveStart with, say, five pixels
right. Fantastic, now we do the same thing

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,959 align:middle line:90%
with the left. Now we could just copy this
component again, paste the component onto

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:45,810 align:middle line:90%
the left arrow and just set the drag movement
to minus five. Let's see what happens now.

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,779 align:middle line:90%
A couple of things that we need to check.
Firstly is that clicking down here doesn't

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:55,640 align:middle line:90%
start the drag, good it doesn't and secondly
is ball moved five and ball moved minus five.

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,269 align:middle line:90%
That works. Now, one word of warning, if your
arrows element was above your touch input

00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,370 align:middle line:84%
element in the canvas now look what happens.

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:11,730 align:middle line:90%
You see? It's preferentially, it's assuming
you're clicking the arrows element so you

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,040 align:middle line:90%
actually want the thing that you want above
above in the hierarchy. So the arrows want

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,870 align:middle line:90%
to sit over the touch input so slightly confusingly
it's below it in the hierarchy, that's just

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,839 align:middle line:90%
the default way that it sorts. So it'll be
read from the bottom up this list if you like.

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,459 align:middle line:90%
So there's no 3 dimensional functionality
of that, you can't see it in 3D - well you

00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:35,360 align:middle line:90%
could move things around in 3D but the reliable
way is to get the hierarchy order correct.

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,990 align:middle line:84%
So now we can g plus five and minus five.

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,470 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic I hope that makes sense, we now
have a signal that allows us to nudge our

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,760 align:middle line:90%
ball and a nicely scaling UI - that's another
challenge for you; get the start position

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,910 align:middle line:90%
working. Approach it however you like but
the goal is to be able to drag or nudge the

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,529 align:middle line:90%
ball left and right; only allow moving before
the ball is launched so we're going to have

00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,339 align:middle line:90%
to have some indication - some flag - to say
that the ball is not launched or is in play;

00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,420 align:middle line:90%
and clamp the ball within the lane width,
so when we click those arrows left and right

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,560 align:middle line:90%
we want to make sure that that ball can't
leave the lane.

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:16,300 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead, pause the video, and get the
rest of that working now. OK welcome back.

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,339 align:middle line:90%
So we've done quite well. We've got DragLaunch
here, we know how much we're moving it so

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:26,519 align:middle line:90%
why don't we go ahead and do it? Ball.transform
now there's a useful method here called translate

00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:35,390 align:middle line:90%
and then we can say new Vector3 amount comma
zero comma zero; and if you look up that method

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,390 align:middle line:90%
in Unity's docs you'll see that it just translates
this transform without making an intermediate

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,589 align:middle line:90%
method or intermediate variable. So let's
take a look and see if this works.

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:49,640 align:middle line:90%
There you go. Now you might want to change
those five pixels to something else but that's

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,610 align:middle line:90%
fine now. If we try dragging from here nothing
happens, if we drag from off that bottom bar

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,550 align:middle line:90%
it works but we can nudge while we're in play
which is no good. So we need to supress the

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:05,860 align:middle line:90%
nudging when we are in play. Now, this is
where we have to think about responsibility.

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,200 align:middle line:90%
Who is responsible? Which object? Is it the
ball or the DragLaunch that's responsible

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,149 align:middle line:90%
for knowing whether the ball is in play? Well
I would suggest that it's a private property

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:19,370 align:middle line:90%
of the ball called inPlay and at start it
is false.

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:26,350 align:middle line:90%
OK, or you could make it a public property
of inPlay and query it here so you have a

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,130 align:middle line:90%
few decisions about how you talk to each other;
you either make this MoveStart method - you

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:37,190 align:middle line:90%
could put it onto the ball and say is it OK
for something to move the ball? Well I would

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:43,040 align:middle line:90%
say actually that it is OK to have a public
MoveStart on the ball; it's kind of a moveStart

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,540 align:middle line:90%
request because the ball is going to ignore
it if it's in play. So that might be the simplest

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,339 align:middle line:90%
thing rather than having component to component
communication is that our UI talks directly

00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,519 align:middle line:84%
to the ball, that we change our mind.

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,820 align:middle line:90%
Another option is that our DragLaunch calls
a method on the ball but that's a little bit

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,889 align:middle line:90%
around the houses. Another option is that
we have a public ball in play that we can

00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,790 align:middle line:90%
read from the DragLaunch script. I don't know
which way you want to do it, it's really the

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,620 align:middle line:90%
flick of a coin, there are consequences to
doing it each way; want to make sure that

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,829 align:middle line:90%
things are singularly responsible for what
they are doing, but I think that as the DragLaunch

00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:22,540 align:middle line:90%
script already launches the ball I think that
there's no harm in it also moving the start

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:22,910 align:middle line:84%
position.

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:29,180 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to go down the public ball inPlay
= false route. So now from the outside of

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,639 align:middle line:90%
the ball we can see if it's in play or not
which I think it reasonable. We started off

00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,589 align:middle line:90%
as not in play and then of course on launch
the first thing that we do is say in Play

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,730 align:middle line:90%
= true. Now on a subsequent launch we'll have
to add more code to this but let's see how

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:49,579 align:middle line:90%
it goes, we can always refactor later. The
key here now is that on DragLaunch we only

00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:57,389 align:middle line:90%
do this if not in play. Now I always put a
space after my exclamation mark because it's

00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:00,040 align:middle line:84%
really hard to see an exclamation mark otherwise.

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,889 align:middle line:90%
The other way that you could write this is
if inPlay == false but that's a bit of a weird

00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:11,170 align:middle line:90%
thing to do but it reads more clearly, you
can actually see that I'm saying if it's not

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,690 align:middle line:90%
in play. So I think in this case that I'm
going to do that but bear in mind you would

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,970 align:middle line:90%
normally just go exclamation mark in play
like that. But you see that that's very easy

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,240 align:middle line:90%
to miss that exclamation mark even if we put
a space, even if we put two spaces. Two spaces

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,010 align:middle line:90%
does it, if not in play. You get the idea,
there are two options. That or ball.inPlay

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,470 align:middle line:90%
== false. I'm going to stick with this for
now.

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,139 align:middle line:90%
There's always lots of ways of doing things.
So only if the ball is not in play do we do

00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,910 align:middle line:90%
this. Let's see if that's helped. Now we can
nudge but if we flick and then try and do

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,279 align:middle line:90%
it... well OK my flick was a bit weird then,
let's just do a standard kind of flick down

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,769 align:middle line:90%
there and then try and nudge and it won't.
Perfect! So a lot of talking, a lot of doing

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,920 align:middle line:90%
but look we've got extra UI elements now that
automatically scale as the screen space changes

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,079 align:middle line:90%
and, you know not perfectly but there's a
finite size of these arrows, if the screen

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,089 align:middle line:90%
space is too small then obviously it's going
to break down but it works pretty well.

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:11,250 align:middle line:90%
We've got the idea of all of these elements
kind of sticking together, and we have a simple

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,310 align:middle line:90%
way of moving the ball left and right. Now
you may have said why don't we drag the ball?

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,060 align:middle line:90%
Well you can only do one type of drag. You're
either dragging the ball to launch it or you're

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,510 align:middle line:90%
dragging it to move it. If you have two types
of drags then that's really confusing. So

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,089 align:middle line:90%
you could drag maybe with two fingers but
why make it that complicated? I think in this

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:34,459 align:middle line:90%
instance, you know in a real bowling lane
you kind of stand or you start on a particular

00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:38,389 align:middle line:90%
marker with your feet, so setting this as
a kind of one off is fine;

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:43,120 align:middle line:90%
and then all the skill is in dragging in the
correct way. Now bear in mind that this touch

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,760 align:middle line:90%
system right now is nothing to do with the
lane. If I start here and I want it to go

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,260 align:middle line:90%
straight down the lane or slightly right I
have to say go from here to just slightly

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,149 align:middle line:90%
right of that above so I need to do something
like that. So it's actually pretty skill based

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,329 align:middle line:90%
which I quite like. So there you go, we have
the full control system that we need for the

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:06,709 align:middle line:90%
ball at the moment except spin, and we'll
deal with spin in a subsequent video. So congratulations

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,589 align:middle line:84%
on getting this far, if you did all the challenges.

00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:13,329 align:middle line:90%
I hope that the code makes sense for you,
we've decided to leave the movement in DragLaunch

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,160 align:middle line:90%
just because it's already responsible for
everything to do with dragging and launching

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,570 align:middle line:90%
the ball and the only change that we've made
to the ball is a public Boolean to say that

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,220 align:middle line:90%
it's in play or not. As a general note Boolean
flags like this mean that there's a design

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,519 align:middle line:90%
issue so use them carefully, don't use too
many Boolean flags, we'll show you lots of

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,519 align:middle line:84%
other options later. OK, cool, see you soon.
