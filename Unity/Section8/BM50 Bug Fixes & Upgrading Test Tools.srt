00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Hey guys! So.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.900
here we're going to look at a couple of things. Firstly. kindly a couple

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.900
of our students have pointed out some bugs. So firstly.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.900
this actually ins't a bug. but I want to make sure that it behaves properly. It's in our score display

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.900
test. I want to add a new test. because Ben Vasco said

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.900
if you bowl 0 pins on the first bowl of a frame

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.900
and 10 on the second bowl of a frame. it is actually a spare.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.900
So. let's just make sure that. that is the case. So. I'm going to go down

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.900
and put in a new test. and I am going to call it

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.900
T06. And then. I'm just going to call it Bowl010.

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.900
So. if we bowl 0 then 10. what we should get out of it

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.900
is a nothing and then a spare forward slash. Let's see if we do.

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.900
So. save the script. Make sure it's saved. Back over into Unity

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.900
and let's let the tests run.

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.900
Now I need to rerun. Bowl 010 works! Fantastic!

16
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.900
OK. now the second thing I'm going to deal with is the fact that actually we have an invalid

17
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.900
test. If we look in our score display test again. at the bottom

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.900
we have this GoldenCopy 2of3. Look. if we go

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.900
1091 in the final frame. actually the last thing we should see is a

20
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.900
spare. not a 1. So. 9 and 1 together make

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.900
spare. OK. so let's see what happens if we try running that.

22
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.900
the code against that test. The test is actually wrong in this case.

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.900
Now we get a fail. and we get a fail because what our code is giving us is 91

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.900
and it should be giving us a 9 spare. So. a quick challenge for you. I won't even put up a slide.

25
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.900
Just fix that in the code if you can. So. go to the code for

26
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.900
ScoreDisplay and see if you can fix it.

27
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.900
OK welcome back! So. thank you very much

28
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.900
to Elijah I believe. who pointed out this problem for us

29
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.900
and solved it! What you need to do here is. this line is the offending

30
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.900
line. It's saying that a spare is when

31
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.900
box mod 2 is 0. but we have an exception on box 21.

32
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.900
because box mod 2 is not 0 and box 21 is that weird third frame.

33
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.900
So. what I'm going to do is just say box mod 2. take out a few spaces.

34
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.900
or box == 21.

35
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.900
I will probably just reduce the length of the comment.

36
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.900
OK. so in the case that we have box mod 2 is 0. which covers all the

37
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.900
frames apart from the last one. and then. the final frame our box is 21. Let's try that.

38
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.900
save it. back into Unity. let the whirligig

39
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.900
finish. and we still have a failing test. What's the

40
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.900
problem? Let me rerun. There you go. all passing! Fantastic!

41
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.900
OK. so that's two things sorted out. I want to tell you a final thing. I can't reproduce it for

42
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.900
you I'm afraid. I've tried. But when I came to this for the first time and I haven't used

43
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.900
this section for a little while. this project for a little while. none of my tests were running. In fact. none of the ticks

44
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.900
were even showing up. If that ever happens to you. here's what I did to fix it. So.

45
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.900
what I would suggest is that you quit your project.

46
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.900
you go find your project folder. which is here.

47
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.900
and delete everything in the root.

48
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.900
all of these solution and preferences files. and the Library folder.

49
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900
leaving only Assets and ProjectSettings. I'm also leaving a readme file.

50
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.900
That may clear it on it's own. just clearing the caches. becaues what can happen

51
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.900
is. your version of Unity can get out of sync with the version of the Unity test tools.

52
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.900
If after importing and recompiling all of this stuff it still doesn't work.

53
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.900
then go to the Assets Store and I'll just tell you what to look out for.

54
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.900
It's a simple tweak. So. go to the Assets Store. which

55
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.900
is Windows. Asset Store. Remember what you need to search for.

56
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.900
for Unity test tools. It's Unity Test Tools.

57
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.900
When you search for that. make sure that you're seeing this one by Unity Technologies.

58
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.900
When you click on it. this for me says Import. but it might for you say

59
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.900
Upgrade. So. just go ahead. download. re-import it. and upgrade it. If it still

60
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.900
doesn't work or you get weird errors. clear those files again in your Unity folder.

61
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.900
The Library folder. so your

62
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.900
left with just Assets and ProjectSettings. these ones highlighted. Delete everything else

63
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.900
and try again. and that should clear the problem for you. OK. that's two bugs

64
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.900
sorted out. The code is even stronger. So. I hope you enjoyed this brief and simple video. and I will see you soon!
