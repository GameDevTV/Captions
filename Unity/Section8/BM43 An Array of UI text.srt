00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Welcome back so I don't know about you
but I want to start seeing my scores in

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,639
this video we gonna rearrange your UI to
make space for the scores; create your

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,210
score board and then wire up your
score board. So I'm just gonna talk you

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,010
through my ideas here I've got a very
basic UI I think I don't need the right

00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,039
panel so I'm going to ditch the right
panel and what I want to do is also

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,660
get the arrows in my case on to the left
panel. Now you can arrange your UI

00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,050
however you like, you can even go be bold
and make it portrait if you want, which

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,059
may be even better for bowling but I'm
just gonna keep it simple and keep

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,860
the learning flowing so I have these
arrows I want him in the left panel so

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,469
I need to child into the left panel and then
it's just a question of getting in there

00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:52,520
and snapping to the bottom like so I
might make them a little bit higher so

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,510
what've I got? 40 pixels high let's say and I
just need to check the scaling and

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,690
stretching and it's sticking to the
bottom and stretching. Cool, looks good

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,909
let's just check the game view and make
sure that once we release the mouse that

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:10,880
this guy scales sensibly. Yeah looks OK, so there we
go, we can still nudge in the same way if we

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,979
were to play the game. Still nudge in
exactly the same way it's just that we

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,570
made some room along the bottom of the
screen now for the scores so that's where

00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,950
I'm going to pop them, so let's make ourselves
under the UI canvas or make yourself a

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,100
score panel, I'm going to challenge in a little
bit to actually fill it out with all of the

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,710
details but everyone is going to need at
least a score panel. So let's call it

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:43,130
scores. fantastic so there's the
scores panel, of course it's far too

00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,040
big, it's across the entire top of the
UI so let's make it 40 pixels high

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,579
maybe, same as the other guy and then
snapped to the bottom and stretching

00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:59,119
So again over in game view just rearrange
your game window to make sure that that

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,500
behaves. It does, Coolio. OK so now it's a
question of populating this so I'm going to

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,170
draw up one unit to help you out of frame
scores and bowls and then I'm going to

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,730
challenge you to populate it with the rest

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:19,129
so let's have a little bit of a think, a bit of
planning we've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 roughly six

00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:23,900
Unity game units along the bottom here
let's just see how that translates to

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,530
pixelsSo if I pop a single text box in
here and have a look. So if the left if

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,069
the left hand side of this, well let's look
at the center of the text box actually

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,140
here it said minus 300 pixels, here it's
at plus 300 pixels, I'm seeing that you

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,530
see the 300 there in between just to the
left of the thing I'm dragging so we're 300

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,900
pixels right 300 pixels left of that
center point so it's 600 pixels wide,

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,750
we've got 21 scores why don't we make it
twenty by twenty pixels? Let's try that

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,500
and I'm gonna go through font size
of 14 but i wanna make my text a lot

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,019
blacker than that, there you go. So let's
test it let's put a single character in

00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:10,200
say I'm going to stick with six just for
fun and I think I want these characters

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,120
like that

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,120
centralized both vertically and
horizontally. Cool, so what I'm thinking

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,220
now is having a bunch of little kind of
duplets or triplets even where we

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,220
have bowl a, bowl b, just name these things up
as we go to there's bowl b, let me just zoom

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:35,519
in get into a line perfectly so bowl a, bowl
b, and what we're gonna do in a moment is

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,290
just duplicate all these guys but
but I'll challenge you in a moment to do

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,269
all this yourself, the point is create this
unit for yourself now and then obviously you're

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,950
going to do all the replication of the other units in a moment, so you're welcome to follow along with

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,130
this. Now this last guy, to make it look
good is a little bit challenging it's

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,239
gonna need up to three digits so the
question is how do you lay this out? Well

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,650
I'm just gonna pull its right hand side
in a little bit until these align, and

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,310
one way of checking their line is to use
a character like a one and just put

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,340
maybe 1, 1, 1 and they are pretty much aligned
or perfectly aligned? I would say

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,760
perfectly aligned. That's good, so the
triplet I've got looks something like

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,230
that, two boxes called Bowl a, bowl b I'm
struggling to name this a guy! Bowl a, bowl b

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:26,210
and score. OK so we have a triplet like that
now so to get it across remember your snap

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,090
settings I'm gonna set myself an x
snap of 50, why 50? Well look, if we select all these

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,350
three guys and then hold down command or
control on a PC and drag using the

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,550
transform tool what what happens at fifty... 50
100 150 200 and its just because these

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,540
Unity grid squares tie in
every, well they're obviously every 100

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,040
pixels so we're looking at how it works
so that's it you've got everything you

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,680
need now to duplicate this right across
and also modify the final frame so that

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,880
you have three bowls in there. So that's
your challenge for now it's just to finish

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,600
off the creation of this score board so
make space for up to 21 bowls that take single

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,510
characters, also ensure you have ten
frame score boxes and remember that

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,780
frame scores need to take up to three
digits. Go ahead, pause the video and get

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,820
your score board somewhere on your
screen and laid out now. Could be

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,100
the top, the bottom, down the side, however you like.

00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,030
Welcome back so to keep this sane I'm

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,510
going to organize all of these score
blocks these triplets into frames so one

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:40,260
way to do that is to create yourself a
UI panel and then from that panel child it

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,640
to the scores, the panel is frame 0

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:50,160
1, zero because we know we're gonna have
nine... ten or more so therefore we need a

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,210
leading 0 for them to sort properly then
it doesn't need an image on it and it

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,840
doesn't need a canvas renderer on it
either it's basically the same as creating

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,110
an empty GameObject if we look at an empty game
object it's just a transform. If we look

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,260
at this guy it's just an empty Rect
transform so its screen space rather than

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,650
world space so frame 01 here now if we child
all these guys to... well actually before

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,370
you child them to frame 01 let's get
frame 01 positioned properly

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,780
where is it right now? What's its size?
Look at the size of it, it's massive it's crazy.

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,020
So that's because this position here is
relative to its parent, now its parent is

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,190
the score panel down there. So
obviously as a start we wanted 00 as a

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,449
starting point and then we

00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,419
need to decide just how big it's gonna
be well it needs to be big enough to

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:41,409
just contain the scores, so
something like that. In fact I might even snap

00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:45,419
it so it exactly contains the score
elements now this is not critical

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:50,069
really at all because all that matters
is that this whole thing this whole

00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,389
frame here once you've subbed these three
text elements to it, that's what you need

00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,789
to do you make your frame which is just
a rect transform you sub in your bowl

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,999
a bowl b and your score like that that
once you've got this frame it's just

00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:08,379
important that you can move it around
and it's in a vaguely sensible position so

00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,460
let's get another frame by clicking on
frame and duplicating look how helpful that is,

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,150
it's called it frame 02 and it's put
it below, and if I move this frame 02 whilst

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,240
holding down the command or control key,
with my snap setting set and make sure

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,399
your snap settings are set, and edit snap
settings and then you want a fifty in my

00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,960
case I want 50 for the x value, and that will
apply to 50 pixels here in UI mode and

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,419
then what I want to do is I want to move
this guy but I want to move it by

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:43,069
snapping by 50 pixels, maybe easier to do
that using the transform tool and there

00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:47,639
is. Now once I've got two next to each other
I just want to zoom out, say are they spaced

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,979
ok? Do they look ok? They look ok so let's
duplicate both of those to make four

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:56,990
and this is where we really get to see
our spacing so holding down Ctrl now is

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,029
the spacing reasonable? Well I don't know, let's look at
the game view, it's pretty good, we

00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:05,249
can see what's going on. Good enough for
government work as they say. So, we have

00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,749
four frames and now we really get some
leverage, because we just duplicate the

00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:12,589
four frames hold down CTRL, move them
across, so we even can see what frame number we're

00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:16,029
up to, it's really cool the way it renames
objects like this, hold down control and you've

00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,659
now got ten frames. Let's go focus
on the final frame, it just needs a tweak

00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:23,969
doesn't it so the frame itself is not
it's just not big enough so remember you need to be

00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:29,719
in UI mode for this in order to make the
change to the to the panel, there it is, and that's

00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,039
fine make a little bit bigger and then
these guys inside need to be moved

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,139
across a little bit and then we need
another score so let's put another score

00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:42,580
in or another bowl should we say, then move them all a little bit round

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,710
and check they're in the frame... looks ok to
me. Move this guy frame score across and

00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:54,520
how's that? That looks pretty good to me so
that's fine, now I just want to get a bit

00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,600
of naming going on here, bowl B1 is a
bit odd that's the downside of it appending

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,470
numbers on the end so we want bowl c. So
look at the sanity of this we've got

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,050
scores which is just a panel of scores
there that we can collapse or expand in our hierarchy

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,040
and then we've got each frame and then the bowls
in each frame ; bowl a bowl b, like so bowl

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,710
a, bowl b, score, and that pattern just
repeats and in frame 10 - double click to

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,780
focus, or frame

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,440
bowl a, bowl b, bowl c, score. Awesome! So well then if
you got that far you have a set of

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,000
scores basically, which is which is great
Now you wanna move them en masse of

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,410
course you can select the whole lot and
just shift along a little bit, pretty easy

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:31,830
right?

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,610
so wherever you like that looks ok
check it in game view always, just make sure

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,500
it renders how you expect and I think
it's going to work

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,720
cool so that's the first challenge the
next challenge of course is we need this

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
score display script. At the moment we
don't have a script that's gonna be

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,300
responsible for displaying the score. Let's
just briefly revisit our architectural

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,860
diagram. So we've got the pin counter
sending the pinfall to the game master

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,820
that stores the game state as a list of
pins; sends that list of pin falls over to

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,370
the action master that sends an action back,
which controls the pin setter and resets the

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,540
ball. and sends it to score master which send
scores back now we haven't really defined

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:14,580
what scores is; it's two things it's a list
of frames, frame scores, which is fine and

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,010
the other thing is what do we do about
the bowls? Well we haven't quite decided

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:23,490
yet what we're gonna get out of here, or
what we gonna send at least to the score

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,400
display in terms of the bowls themselves.
It could be single characters, it could

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,130
be one long string, it could be a
list

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,280
although when you get a strike then there's
nothing, how's score display going to know to

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,700
skip a box? so this is an API we'll need to
think about next video but what we need

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,910
to do for now anyway is get score
display set up and ready to go and

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,510
connected to the relevant UI elements that we
just created so why don't you go ahead and do that

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,850
now write yourself a score display class
once you've written the score display

00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,690
class

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,520
I want you to create an array of text in
it, wire all the scoreboard boxes to this

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,180
display manually in the inspector, drag them
across and just do the same for the frame

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,080
scores so that you have a score display
class that can actually write to all of

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,800
those texts elements that we just created. Go ahead, pause the video and do all that now please

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,800
whittle sticks welcome back, I'm not sure what whittle sticks are but I'm sure they're cool.

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,450
OK so I'm gonna make a class called cord, well,

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,040
score display even and then at the top
of that class I need a couple of things

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,040
they're just gonna be arrays both of them
because we have a finite and

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,300
predetermined number of text elements, so 
when you've got a predetermined list of things then an array

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:41,400
seems like the sensible construct so I'm
gonna have a public text array, now text

00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,110
doesn't exist of course you know about
this now, you need to be using Unity

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,850
engine . UI, so now the text type
will exist and I can validly create a

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:57,110
text array, public text text. OK now I
haven't given it a variable name so

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:04,890
let's call it rolls, or rolltexts and
let's have another one declare it on the

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:11,170
same line, frame texts and that just
makes it clear that they're texts ok and

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,620
they're public arrays of those things so
over in unity now if we decide to put our

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,880
score display script on something so
what would it make sense to put the

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,630
score display script on I think on the
scores object right? Because that's the

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,130
object that's responsible. Look what
we've got, we've got a roll texts and a

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,020
frame texts array. So the roll texts is
gonna be of size 21 and it's going to

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,380
be great fun to fill that in, let's just
go ahead and get it done, let's

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,300
just suck it up. A couple of ways you
could do that of course you can just

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,300
drag them straight from here or you
could click this button and then try and

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,050
find it in your assets list, not going
to be so easy to do though because we get

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,750
the repetition of the name and we don't
get the hierarchy so I recommend just

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,470
carefully dragging in bowl a, bowl b

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:57,050
frame two, bowl a... this is fun right? Now you
could say is there a better way to do

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,130
this? Of course there is, there's lots of ways you can
do everything in unity and you could use

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,400
the names programmatically but in terms
of you know it's one off right? There's 21 to

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,700
do, by the time you've moaned about it and
thought of a more automated way to do it you

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,770
could have just done it, in fact you get
your designer or your mom to do this bit.

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,750
I know that the developers out there
hate doing this type of repetitive task

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,750
and so do I but why create a framework
in this case for something more

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,720
complicated to do this? You say well in the future
I might have a game with 30 bowls, or three thousand well

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,470
deal with it then because by doing this
once or twice to get a feel for how long

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,670
things actually do take manually and you
can make a sensible judgment as to

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,750
whether it's worth automating now I
don't even know if I'm doing this right

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:44,250
bear in mind that arrays are index offset
+ 1 so the bowl numbers are gonna be

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,990
slightly wrong because they start counting at 0 but
I have done it right and there's the

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,200
nervousness can end. It looks like a, b and
then c are gonna slot in and I have

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,020
space for all 21 bowls; whether we use them
or not, well it depends how the game pans out

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,770
doesn't it? a, b, a, b, a, b, a, b... wicked okay and then we've also got

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:08,090
frame scores, so the hierarchies all opened wide
up I need to firstly allocate an

00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,610
array of appropriate size, what is the
size? How many frame score texts are

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,940
there? 10 right, okay and then it's
literally just a question for each frame

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,660
of just going in, getting these guys, the
scores and you can common-sense check it

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,380
as you go making sure that it says
score score score score and yes I

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,580
know you're gonna hate me for doing this
manually... other ways of doing it, you

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,050
could use GameObject dot find objects of
type or tag and you could tag all these

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,810
guys and then you could name them and
write a script that goes through and looks

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,040
at the name but then if somebody messes up
the name in the hierarchy or your designer

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,840
goes in and does something then it all breaks... there's probably a thousand ways, do put in the discussions if you've

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,070
got a neat way of doing it but I think
for 20 odd items you're better off

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,370
just hard wiring it like this

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,610
whittle sticks. we're done. We now have
programmatic access to everything so

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,089
better check it I guess we better just
go to score display and just on start

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,370
just say roll texts

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,730
one let's say, zero, the first one

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:14,910
arrays start at 0, dot text, remember equals and
then let's just make it an x for strike

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:22,370
that's fine and why don't we set a
frame score frame texts, put the first

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:30,250
frame score 2, 0 remember though that it is a string
here because it's a text element. Run the

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,660
game

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,810
make sure that the first elements update
from the script boom X 0 and then everything

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,750
else is as we left it.

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,279
Good job guys, that's all fantastic the
only final thing you may want to do here

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,250
of course is all of your text elements
currently have funny spurious stuffs in

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,750
them like you've got scores and all the
rest of it test scores et cetera so you

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,850
probably want to empty all of these
elements here which of course we could

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,990
have done at the beginning but we needed
to see what was going on right and you

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,010
could always have your code just
initialize these that's another way, you

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,560
could just put nothing into all of these
boxes. I for the sake of it am just going

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,600
to go here and remove the text or put a
space in, and that has the effect of

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,630
clearing down the scoreboard, but
when we play the game the program can

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,330
now write to it. Cool, we have somewhere
to write our bowls and out frame scores to, I look

00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,100
forward to seeing you for the
programming aspect of this in the next lecture.
