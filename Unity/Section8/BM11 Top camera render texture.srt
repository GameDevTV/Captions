00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Hi and welcome back. Now we are going to use
a render texture so we can have a top-down

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.509 align:middle line:90%
camera looking at the pins. So in this video
we're going to create a render texture ready

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.150 align:middle line:90%
for the camera output. read more about them
at Unity's docs there. Position a top-down

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:90%
camera looking at the pins. then we'll create
a user interface panel and embed a "raw image”

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:90%
with this render texture. Lots of new terms!
Render textures are a brand new feature to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:90%
the free version of Unity - they were always
available in Unity Pro but you can access

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:84%
them for free now.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cool right? So the first thing
that I'm going to do is just start tidying

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:90%
up. I now have too many things in my root
here. so it's a good time to start putting

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:90%
scripts into my scripts folder and other things
away as we need them. I'll just do that for

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:90%
now. scripts and scenes is all we need for
now. Now scenes are so important to access

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:90%
that I often prefix my scenes folder with
an underscore so I can quickly get to it because

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:11.729 align:middle line:90%
it floats to the beginning. Right? So we also
have prefabs. Now remember that we ultimately

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.229 align:middle line:90%
want everything prefabbed but the pins themselves
- each one of them is prefabbed.

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.939 align:middle line:90%
Bowling pin ten probably wants to be named
bowling pin ten; but also we're going to want

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:90%
to prefab the whole pin array - so why don't
we do that now quickly? We're just having

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:90%
a tidy up before we move on. So now in our
prefab folder we not only have the pins themselves

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:90%
we have our entire pin arrangement ready to
instantiate when we need to reset the pins.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Great. so that's blue. I like that. The floor
we don't need to prefab yet because in another

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
scene. if we had another scene of the game
we might have a completely different floor

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:90%
but the ball. I think that the ball's worth
prefabbing for sure and the light and the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.149 align:middle line:84%
camera we'll leave for now.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.689 align:middle line:90%
So that's a little bit tidier isn't it? That's
fantastic so the floor is a material; so I'm

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:90%
going to make a new folder called materials
and textures; or just textures for now. Now

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.729 align:middle line:90%
I should let you know. there's another way
of finding things here in Unity - you can

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.939 align:middle line:90%
organise by prefabs script etc. but we've
slightly broken the convention with this start

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:90%
pack so that I can easily export all of these
different things though some of these things

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:90%
are in different folders. right? You've got
start packs scripts and then you've got script

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:90%
up in the assets and that might drive you
a bit nuts;

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:90%
But. it's actually pretty cool because we
have multiple ways of categorising the same

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.530 align:middle line:90%
thing and if you want to see all of your scripts
in one place which might be what you're hankering

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:90%
after click over here in the top right of
assets on the search by type box button and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:90%
then click under script; and then look that's
going to aggregate all of your scripts in

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:90%
one place. So actually organising by something
but the type in these folders is a good idea

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:90%
because you can already show everything of
a type over here. we could see all materials

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:90%
for instance and that will pull materials
from both this textures folder and from the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
start pack. you get the idea?

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:90%
So you think you've seen that before but there's
another tip for you. OK so to create this

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.099 align:middle line:90%
render texture for you go to assets. go to
create. and then go down to render texture

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:90%
- there you go. Assets / create / render texture.
Boom. there it is. and I'm going to call it

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.989 align:middle line:90%
top camera. not going to bother with the space
in this case. there it is. looks a bit funny

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:90%
but that's because nothing is streaming into
it. Don't worry about the settings for now.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:90%
let's just leave them default unless we want
to change anything which we don't right now.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic. so we have a texture ready for
the camera to render into. What I want you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:90%
to do now is to actually create this "top
down” camera. so I want you to create and

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.239 align:middle line:90%
position a top view camera. put the camera
above the pins looking down. make the pins

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.319 align:middle line:90%
fill about 80% of its view. set the target
texture to the TopCamera.renderTexture that

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:90%
we just created and test that the game still
runs. You won't see any difference but just

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:90%
make sure that your camera - your main camera
- still works. Go ahead. pause the video.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and do that now.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back. let's pop back into Unity
and figure out how to do this. So you need

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:90%
to create yourself a new camera. now where
is that? It's in Gameobject / camera there

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:90%
so do that. now I'm going to pop mine at the
top. and I'm going to call it top camera.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:90%
OK? There it is. OK now we need to position
this camera in the right place so. it's a

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:90%
question of getting it over the pins. Well
one easy way to do that is to set its z distance

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:90%
to 1829 wasn't it? Should be right over the
top of the pins and then we're going to need

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:90%
to go into the rotate tool in the top left
here and point it downwards.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.419 align:middle line:90%
Now what's happening? How come this camera
isn't showing anything? Well. because it's

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:90%
at a y position of -80. let's try putting
it at 100. one metre above. Ahh. more like

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.389 align:middle line:90%
it. There it is. above. and you look in the
camera preview we're starting to get there

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:90%
now. Obviously it needs to move back a little
bit further than that and so on. Now. do we

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:90%
want it to be a perspective camera? Well that's
a good question. I'm not sure that I do want

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:90%
it to be a perspective camera because it's
a bit weird. Let's try an orthographic camera.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh. kind of does the thing apart from of course
it is in completely the wrong scale now.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.729 align:middle line:90%
So let's move it up and that's not going to
help; why doesn't it help when you move an

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:28.949 align:middle line:90%
orthographic camera upwards. anybody know?
Well that's because it has no perspective.

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:90%
you can only adjust it by adjusting its size.
here you go. So make the camera orthographic

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
I suggest. move it back in z and rotate it
until it has a 90 degree rotation. so it's

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.699 align:middle line:90%
an orthographic camera that's looking directly
down. then use the z co-ordinate. there you

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.970 align:middle line:84%
go. You see. and then adjust the size.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:90%
So what I want you to adjust in this camera
is projection to orthographic. adjust the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.979 align:middle line:90%
size until about 80% of the screen is filled
with pins. Adjust the rotation so that it's

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:90%
x rotation of 90 i.e. pointing straight down
on top of the pins. Z position wants to be

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.009 align:middle line:90%
roughly in the middle of the pins. that's
going to be around about the 1870 mark. calculate

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:90%
it precisely if you want; x = 0 would make
sense and then y well that doesn't actually

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.479 align:middle line:90%
matter very much so let's put it a couple
of metres above; as long as it's above it

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.069 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter because it's an orthographic
camera you see how it's got a square projection

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
box?

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:90%
It kind of looks like it's not above the pins
there but if you come to the right angle in

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.069 align:middle line:90%
3D. practicing your movement. it actually
is right above the pins. Fantastic so we've

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:90%
achieved the first bit of what we wanted to
do. what I also said I wanted you to do was

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:90%
render out to a target texture because look.
notice right now if you try and play the game

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.419 align:middle line:90%
it's all very well but where the hell's my
main camera gone? Why can't I see the main

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:90%
camera? Well. you may try going to the main
camera and setting a tag of main camera - you'll

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:84%
find it won't work.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle line:90%
You could disable the top camera sure. now
your game's back to normal but now your camera

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.039 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work. I think you'll find what you
need to do to get this working is to get the

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:90%
target texture rendering out to the top camera.
So this top camera here now no longer renders

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:90%
to the game view but renders into your target
texture. Now your game gets its main camera

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.389 align:middle line:90%
view back but this top - this target texture
is being rendered into. We just have to trust

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:18.699 align:middle line:90%
that for now because we can't see the texture
just yet. that's going to come up in just

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
a second.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:90%
OK so let's make this camera - this top camera
render texture have somewhere to render to.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.509 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to start by helping you to create
the user interface. and then I'm going to

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:36.229 align:middle line:90%
challenge you to finish that but off. So what
do we start with? Well we need a UI canvas

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:90%
to start with and that's your overall UI canvas.
so you may as well just leave it default.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Canvas and remember that it comes with an
event system so that's there ready to go.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:90%
now we're going to use a screen space camera
canvas this time. which means that it's relative

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:90%
to the camera. it stays with the camera. You'll
see how that manifests in a moment.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:90%
So we have a screen space camera canvas like
that and it's sitting over here. which is

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:90%
a bit of an odd position but we'll worry about
that in a moment. Before we can really see

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:90%
what the camera is doing we need to create
ourselves within that a panel; we're going

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:90%
to have a left panel which is going to be
the pins and the number of pins standing and

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:90%
then the right panel on the right hand side
in perspective that shows us how our scores

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:90%
are doing and all that. So create yourself
a panel and call it left panel. So at this

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.919 align:middle line:90%
stage you should have a UI canvas with a left
panel subbed to it.

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Then you can shrink down that left panel a
little bit by using the UI gripper tool like

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.229 align:middle line:90%
this. and see the effect we're having in the
game window. You see how I have a panel on

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:90%
the left hand side there? Now we can perfect
that later but that's a good start. If I am

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:90%
to play the game. you see how that panel stays
with the ball? Cool we'll leave the grey cast

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:90%
to this panel just for now. because that is
going to let us know where it is and then

00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:90%
we'll have another panel. we may as well do
it right now. called imaginatively right panel;

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.760 align:middle line:90%
and I might just call the canvas UI canvas
so UI canvas with a right panel and a left

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:90%
panel. Let's remove this right panel using
the UI gripper tool to the right there and

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
have a look at the game again.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:90%
So on the left I'm going to have a top-down
view of the pin and various other things and

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.149 align:middle line:90%
on the right I'm going to have my scoring
system so you might want the left panel to

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:90%
be wider than that - taller rather and the
right panel to also be taller. We'll make

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:90%
the sizes equal later when we tweak the user
interface but you get the idea. Perfect so

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:90%
it's not interfering with your view but it
is there waiting. Right so I've got a challenge

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%
for you then now that we've set up the UI
I want you to do something. and here it is.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:90%
OK so here's the challenge for you. I want
you to set up the camera view user interface.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Create a game object UI raw image. position
it on the UI left panel. set the texture to

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:90%
TopCamera.renderTexture and test that you
can see that top-down view inside. Have a

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:90%
go. persist until you get this working if
you can. We want on the left hand panel to

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:90%
see a permanent view of the top-down camera
when you hit the pins you should be able to

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%
see it from above. Have a go. good luck. and
I'll see you in a moment.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back. so let's make this thing work.
Fantastic. so I said in the left panel we

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:90%
needed to create ourselves a UI raw image
so let's do that and child it to the left

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
panel. There it is. now I'm going to pop mine
something like this. top of the left panel.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:90%
again we'll tweak all this later. I love these
UI tools. you see how they're helping us snap

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:90%
etc.? I'm going to call it top view. there.
so I've called it top view and I've got a

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:90%
raw image already and the texture I want is
the top camera texture so let's just drop

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
