ï»¿WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back. in this video we're going to
be improving the scaling of our User Interface.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.740 align:middle line:90%
So we will add a new UI panel. ready for a
swipe gesture. We will be launching our ball

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.720 align:middle line:90%
either with a mouse or of your finger on a
touch device. We will set the scaling and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:90%
anchors for our UI panels and then make sure
that it all scales well. So over in our project

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:90%
at the moment we have a UI like this where
we have a screen space overlay User interface

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:90%
here and now it specifically doesn't align
with the world space because it is rendered

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:90%
by the camera right over the top of everything
like that;

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:90%
but you'll notice that if you maximise on
play and then you play your game ignore the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:90%
movement of the ball for a minute. what we're
interested in is these panels. You see they're

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:90%
kind of ugly and they move around pretty randomly
and if I expand to the right this right panel

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:90%
it's not sticking to the side of the screen;
it's kind of a mess. right? So. let's get

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:90%
this sorted. The first thing that we're going
to do before we do anything else is add a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:90%
third panel to the system. So click on your
UI canvas. go to your game object / UI menu

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.799 align:middle line:90%
and then add a new panel; that's what you're
looking for. game object / UI panel.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Perfect. so that adds another panel to the
User interface. Now this is going to be called

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.759 align:middle line:90%
the touch input panel like that and I'm going
to put it to the top. just indicate to myself

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:90%
that this wants to be top layer. Now it has
an image and it needs to keep an image with

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:90%
it otherwise the event system won't pick up
our mouse movements in the subsequent lectures.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:90%
but what we want to do with this image is
actually remove this image so we have an image

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.899 align:middle line:90%
script but no image; OK? Then you can set
your alpha to completely transparent. you

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.369 align:middle line:90%
see the difference in the background there?
If we have fully alpha'd then we have white;

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.979 align:middle line:90%
then of course we're not going to be able
to see through it. if we have 0 alpha then

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:90%
we can see perfectly through that panel. So
this touch input panel there is in the next

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:90%
section. in the next video. is going to be
used to detect the position of our mouse clicks

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.420 align:middle line:90%
wherever we click on the screen and allow
us to have the right type of interface. So

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:90%
that's that bit. Now what we need to start
doing is looking at the way that these panels

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:90%
work. So let's start with the left panel.
The left panel if you use your 't' key or

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
your user interface control tool. you can
see that it's snapped to the left hand side

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:84%
at the moment. of the game space;

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:90%
but what it's not doing is scaling appropriately.
So let's start to get it to do that. Drag

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:90%
this user interface so that it's about a third
of the width of the screen. being aware that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:90%
it depends on how your current screen is set
up. it depends how big your game window is;

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:90%
because your game window is floating with
your scene window; but take about a third

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:90%
of the screen. something like that. Make sure
that it's snapping to the background appropriately.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.659 align:middle line:90%
you could set the left and top positions to
zero. OK. perfect. now what we need to look

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:90%
at is the anchors. so if you click on this
little icon here. what we actually want you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to do is stretch like that.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.959 align:middle line:90%
We want it to stretch on the left hand side.
Try that setting there. stretch attach to

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:90%
the left. Go to the game window. leave maximise
on play on. hit play and then try dragging.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:90%
You see how that left panel is now sticking
to the left a lot better than it was before?

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Perfect. OK so within the left panel we now
have a top view. and again that top view we

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:90%
need to give a similar treatment to. There
it is inside the panel. it needs to be smaller

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:90%
than it currently is. and we want it to stick.
something like that. and we want it stuck

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.239 align:middle line:90%
to what. to the left hand side? Well I don't
know. try. Try anchoring it to the left. for

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:90%
example with this setting here in your anchor
presets;

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.049 align:middle line:90%
then go into your game and have a play. It's
OK. it disappears off the top if the thing's

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:90%
too small. so this is what I want you to do
now. I want you to play with those settings

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:90%
for the left panel and for the right panel
so that when you rescale the game window then

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:90%
they work how you want them to for your game.
OK? That's what I want you to do now. So pause

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
the video and play with your UI anchoring.
and get to know what these buttons and controls

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:90%
do. Don't worry about getting them perfect
now. we need to do a lot of tweaking later

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:90%
when we actually put some things in here but
for now let's just get this roughly scaling

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
how we want it.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:90%
OK so go ahead and do that right now. OK.
welcome back. so I just want to make sure

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:90%
that the main elements like the touch input
scales properly. Another way to do it is to

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:90%
drag your inspector around because this will
change the size of your game window. So the

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:90%
touch input seems to work. the left panel
as we rescale is working OK. it's not perfect

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.669 align:middle line:90%
but we'll make it better later and the right
panel is kind of OK as well. let's try it

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:90%
the other way. Ah they're working much better.
right and when we let go of the drag you see

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
how theyâ€™re re-scaling? Much better.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:90%
OK the only problem that I have is that my
top down view isn't quite anchoring how I

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:90%
want it so let's choose a different anchor
maybe a top left anchor. let's see if that's

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:90%
better for the top-down camera view. Yes.
much better look at that. Oops. I didn't need

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
the console there... great. that's much better.
Fantastic. so now we're ready to start getting

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:90%
the game ready for touch input basically so
I'm going to turn off my maximise on play

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be able to play in here eventually.
dragging in the middle but with the confidence

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.190 align:middle line:90%
that if we rescale our screen that these panels
will work. so as a recap for this lesson what

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:90%
we've done is we've gone through each of our
elements in the UI canvas and we've worked

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:90%
on the anchors button. and it's a question
of how things scale and what they stick to

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:90%
so that's what I want you to explore and play
with.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:90%
As I say get it sort of 80% right right now.
don't aim for 100% because we're going to

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:90%
revisiting this once these panels are actually
fully populated with. there's going to be

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:90%
a counter down here for how many pins are
standing. there'll be some control buttons

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:90%
here for restarting the game. and on the right
hand side we'll have the score system basically

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
showing you which player is playing and what
the current frame scores and total scores

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:90%
are. So that's the general plan for the game
and the whole screen will respond as a user

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
interface swipe input.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:90%
You could argue that this game might be better
as a portrait game. most bowling games are

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:90%
portrait on the iPhones just because of the
nature and the shape of their lane but I'm

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:90%
going to be a bit different here because I
quite like having a portrait style centre

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.979 align:middle line:90%
section for the game and then a user interface
on the left and right; also it'll build better

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
for the web that way.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:90%
So congratulations on getting this far in
this video and I look forward to seeing you

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
=======

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,950 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, in this video we're going to
be improving the scaling of our User Interface.

00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,740 align:middle line:90%
So we will add a new UI panel, ready for a
swipe gesture. We will be launching our ball

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,720 align:middle line:90%
either with a mouse or of your finger on a
touch device. We will set the scaling and

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,650 align:middle line:90%
anchors for our UI panels and then make sure
that it all scales well. So over in our project

00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,700 align:middle line:90%
at the moment we have a UI like this where
we have a screen space overlay User interface

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,710 align:middle line:90%
here and now it specifically doesn't align
with the world space because it is rendered

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,260 align:middle line:90%
by the camera right over the top of everything
like that;

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,180 align:middle line:90%
but you'll notice that if you maximise on
play and then you play your game ignore the

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,350 align:middle line:90%
movement of the ball for a minute, what we're
interested in is these panels. You see they're

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,070 align:middle line:90%
kind of ugly and they move around pretty randomly
and if I expand to the right this right panel

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,320 align:middle line:90%
it's not sticking to the side of the screen;
it's kind of a mess, right? So, let's get

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,170 align:middle line:90%
this sorted. The first thing that we're going
to do before we do anything else is add a

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,840 align:middle line:90%
third panel to the system. So click on your
UI canvas, go to your game object / UI menu

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,799 align:middle line:90%
and then add a new panel; that's what you're
looking for, game object / UI panel.

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,420 align:middle line:90%
Perfect, so that adds another panel to the
User interface. Now this is going to be called

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,759 align:middle line:90%
the touch input panel like that and I'm going
to put it to the top, just indicate to myself

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,750 align:middle line:90%
that this wants to be top layer. Now it has
an image and it needs to keep an image with

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,640 align:middle line:90%
it otherwise the event system won't pick up
our mouse movements in the subsequent lectures,

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,700 align:middle line:90%
but what we want to do with this image is
actually remove this image so we have an image

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,899 align:middle line:90%
script but no image; OK? Then you can set
your alpha to completely transparent, you

00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,369 align:middle line:90%
see the difference in the background there?
If we have fully alpha'd then we have white;

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,979 align:middle line:90%
then of course we're not going to be able
to see through it, if we have 0 alpha then

00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:58,820 align:middle line:90%
we can see perfectly through that panel. So
this touch input panel there is in the next

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,280 align:middle line:90%
section, in the next video, is going to be
used to detect the position of our mouse clicks

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,420 align:middle line:90%
wherever we click on the screen and allow
us to have the right type of interface. So

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,830 align:middle line:90%
that's that bit. Now what we need to start
doing is looking at the way that these panels

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,730 align:middle line:90%
work. So let's start with the left panel.
The left panel if you use your 't' key or

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,720 align:middle line:90%
your user interface control tool, you can
see that it's snapped to the left hand side

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,250 align:middle line:84%
at the moment, of the game space;

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,670 align:middle line:90%
but what it's not doing is scaling appropriately.
So let's start to get it to do that. Drag

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:40,280 align:middle line:90%
this user interface so that it's about a third
of the width of the screen, being aware that

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,670 align:middle line:90%
it depends on how your current screen is set
up, it depends how big your game window is;

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,090 align:middle line:90%
because your game window is floating with
your scene window; but take about a third

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,480 align:middle line:90%
of the screen, something like that. Make sure
that it's snapping to the background appropriately,

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,659 align:middle line:90%
you could set the left and top positions to
zero. OK, perfect, now what we need to look

00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:07,060 align:middle line:90%
at is the anchors, so if you click on this
little icon here, what we actually want you

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,620 align:middle line:84%
to do is stretch like that.

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,959 align:middle line:90%
We want it to stretch on the left hand side.
Try that setting there, stretch attach to

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,780 align:middle line:90%
the left. Go to the game window, leave maximise
on play on, hit play and then try dragging.

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,610 align:middle line:90%
You see how that left panel is now sticking
to the left a lot better than it was before?

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,030 align:middle line:90%
Perfect. OK so within the left panel we now
have a top view, and again that top view we

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,400 align:middle line:90%
need to give a similar treatment to. There
it is inside the panel, it needs to be smaller

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,440 align:middle line:90%
than it currently is, and we want it to stick,
something like that, and we want it stuck

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,239 align:middle line:90%
to what, to the left hand side? Well I don't
know, try. Try anchoring it to the left, for

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,980 align:middle line:90%
example with this setting here in your anchor
presets;

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:58,049 align:middle line:90%
then go into your game and have a play. It's
OK, it disappears off the top if the thing's

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,180 align:middle line:90%
too small, so this is what I want you to do
now. I want you to play with those settings

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,090 align:middle line:90%
for the left panel and for the right panel
so that when you rescale the game window then

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,290 align:middle line:90%
they work how you want them to for your game.
OK? That's what I want you to do now. So pause

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:21,220 align:middle line:90%
the video and play with your UI anchoring,
and get to know what these buttons and controls

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,630 align:middle line:90%
do. Don't worry about getting them perfect
now, we need to do a lot of tweaking later

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,580 align:middle line:90%
when we actually put some things in here but
for now let's just get this roughly scaling

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,590 align:middle line:84%
how we want it.

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:39,150 align:middle line:90%
OK so go ahead and do that right now. OK,
welcome back, so I just want to make sure

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,070 align:middle line:90%
that the main elements like the touch input
scales properly. Another way to do it is to

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,650 align:middle line:90%
drag your inspector around because this will
change the size of your game window. So the

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,740 align:middle line:90%
touch input seems to work, the left panel
as we rescale is working OK, it's not perfect

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,669 align:middle line:90%
but we'll make it better later and the right
panel is kind of OK as well, let's try it

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:05,690 align:middle line:90%
the other way. Ah they're working much better,
right and when we let go of the drag you see

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,770 align:middle line:84%
how they’re re-scaling? Much better.

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,110 align:middle line:90%
OK the only problem that I have is that my
top down view isn't quite anchoring how I

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,930 align:middle line:90%
want it so let's choose a different anchor
maybe a top left anchor, let's see if that's

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,520 align:middle line:90%
better for the top-down camera view. Yes,
much better look at that. Oops, I didn't need

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:32,310 align:middle line:90%
the console there... great, that's much better.
Fantastic, so now we're ready to start getting

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,860 align:middle line:90%
the game ready for touch input basically so
I'm going to turn off my maximise on play

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,500 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be able to play in here eventually,
dragging in the middle but with the confidence

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,190 align:middle line:90%
that if we rescale our screen that these panels
will work, so as a recap for this lesson what

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,320 align:middle line:90%
we've done is we've gone through each of our
elements in the UI canvas and we've worked

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,270 align:middle line:90%
on the anchors button, and it's a question
of how things scale and what they stick to

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,630 align:middle line:90%
so that's what I want you to explore and play
with.

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,750 align:middle line:90%
As I say get it sort of 80% right right now,
don't aim for 100% because we're going to

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,630 align:middle line:90%
revisiting this once these panels are actually
fully populated with, there's going to be

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,650 align:middle line:90%
a counter down here for how many pins are
standing, there'll be some control buttons

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,190 align:middle line:90%
here for restarting the game, and on the right
hand side we'll have the score system basically

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,650 align:middle line:90%
showing you which player is playing and what
the current frame scores and total scores

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,360 align:middle line:90%
are. So that's the general plan for the game
and the whole screen will respond as a user

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,060 align:middle line:84%
interface swipe input.

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,970 align:middle line:90%
You could argue that this game might be better
as a portrait game, most bowling games are

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,710 align:middle line:90%
portrait on the iPhones just because of the
nature and the shape of their lane but I'm

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,270 align:middle line:90%
going to be a bit different here because I
quite like having a portrait style centre

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,979 align:middle line:90%
section for the game and then a user interface
on the left and right; also it'll build better

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:48,120 align:middle line:84%
for the web that way.

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,030 align:middle line:90%
So congratulations on getting this far in
this video and I look forward to seeing you

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,030 align:middle line:84%
