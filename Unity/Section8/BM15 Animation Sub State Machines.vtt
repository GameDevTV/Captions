00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, so we're going to talk about
animation sub-state machines. So this part

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.170 align:middle line:90%
is sufficiently complex that I'm going to
take the unusual step of overviewing the pinsetter,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.320 align:middle line:90%
which is the device that resets and clears
the pins and our end goal in a prototype,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.359 align:middle line:90%
and then we will set up a swiper bar to tidy
and reset the pins, add a swipe animation

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.739 align:middle line:90%
etc. and talk about animation state machines,
and manage it all in code. So, quite a lot

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to do and we may end up breaking this into
more than one video.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:90%
So the first thing that I'm going to do is
I'm going to take you to a prototype. This

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.059 align:middle line:90%
is the prototype that I built before teaching
this section and this is going to give you

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:90%
an idea of the end result that we are heading
towards. So, we have something called a swiper,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:90%
it's this thing here. It's a piece of glass
in my case and let's just see what happens

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:90%
with this swiper, so if we click play here
and just go back to the scene view and look

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.439 align:middle line:90%
down at the sharp end of the game down by
the pins and swiper, we have a state machine

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:90%
- an animation state machine that's sitting
in an idle state at the moment and it has

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:90%
two of these funny things that you can create
by right clicking and saying create sub-state

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
machine for reset and tidy.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at the difference. What is a
reset? Well a reset is where the swiper goes

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:90%
down, swipes all the pins out of the way,
comes back again, i.e. renewing the pins,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and then goes back to idle. So let's look
at that substate machine again, so let's just

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.549 align:middle line:90%
pause, you come into this state, this reset
state, you swipe, down here and back; you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.939 align:middle line:90%
renew the pins which is just a single bang
- here - here's a new set of pins and then

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:90%
you lower those pins back down to the ground.
Right? So you swipe, renew lower, let's watch

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.369 align:middle line:84%
it again.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:00.479 align:middle line:90%
So, in the scene view, trigger the reset,
swipe happening now, all the pins get swiped

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:90%
out of the way, renew i.e. instantiate new
pins and then drop them down real quick. OK

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:90%
so that is a reset, and we use a sub state
machine just to keep the animation hierarchy

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:90%
tidy, it sits there in idle just in case we
trigger a reset. Perfect so what's a tidy,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:90%
let's look at a tidy first, click that, all
the pins are lifted up, whatever's left i.e.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:90%
the pins that have fallen over are swiped
and then they're put back down again. So let's

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
look at the sub-state machine.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.709 align:middle line:90%
So we come in, we raise the pins, we lower
the pins again and then we leave. OK so let's

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:90%
look at that again. When the trigger happens
we raise the pins that haven't fallen over,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.280 align:middle line:90%
we swipe the ones that have fallen over and
we lower the pins back down, OK? So you can

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:90%
see how the end result of what we're looking
is pretty neat; it's pretty cool that we can

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:90%
have these submachines and they automatically
reset to idle when they finish resetting or

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:90%
tidying and we are defining what it actually
means to reset the pins or tidy the pins - by

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:90%
the way you can drag around these states all
you like so that you can see them better.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Like that, that's fine.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:90%
So you are making the definition of what it
means to reset or tidy inside the animator.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:90%
The other thing you should know is how do
these work? How does the raise work? Well

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:90%
let's take a look, raise for a start is just
after point three of a second it just calls

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:90%
a method called lift pins. How does swipe
work? Well, swipe here is an actual animation

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:90%
and it has a curve and it has key frames.
Mostly the key frames that you've been looking

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.269 align:middle line:90%
at so literally that's where the swiper moves
through the game space. If we click play and

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:90%
you look in the scene view that's what actually
moves this guy.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:90%
So we have key frames for the swiping, lowering
again is just a call to a method to lower

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:90%
the pins and very similarly for the reset
it's the same type of ideas. In fact we re-used

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.069 align:middle line:90%
the concepts of raising the pins, lowering
the pins, it's only renewing the pins that's

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.989 align:middle line:90%
different for the reset and again that's just
a method call. Now you can for this approach

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.549 align:middle line:90%
of course use animations for lowering and
raising, we just drop the pins when we lower

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.889 align:middle line:90%
them but you're very welcome to include an
animation, you've got the facility to do that.

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
So I quite like this structure, I quite like
the idea that the animator is responsible

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:90%
for this. There are some risks, one of the
risks is that we trigger something and that

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.449 align:middle line:90%
the animator never returns control flow back
to the game because if for any reason one

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:90%
of these things doesn't get called or we get
stuck in an animation state it's slightly

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:90%
risky leaving the core execution flow going
through the animator but I'm showing you lots

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:90%
of different ways of doing things and this
is a perfectly valid approach to go into a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:90%
tidy state through there and automatically
exits through a base layer.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:90%
So let's just watch it in progress once again
and then you are going to be responsible for

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:90%
making it happen; but there is a, what is
this a reset happening now. There it is and

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:90%
then a tidy is slightly different. We're re-using
everything, we only have one renew one lower

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.389 align:middle line:90%
one raise one swipe animation. So it's pretty
neat, it's kind of organised quite nicely.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.139 align:middle line:90%
Cool so you've got the overview of what we
are trying to do here. Now we need to go back

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:90%
to our project as we've left it which is our
BowlMaster project and make our project do

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
this, so bear with me while it loads.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:90%
So where are we? What's the gap between what
we've just seen and where we are? Well we

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.009 align:middle line:90%
don't even have a swiper. So let's go ahead
and make a swiper object to start with. So

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.580 align:middle line:90%
this is just going to be a piece of something
that looks like glass but we'll worry about

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.639 align:middle line:90%
the visuals later, down towards the end of
the scene so go ahead and make yourself a

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:90%
cube - a 3D cube-like object that sits just
above the pins as a swiper. Pause the video

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and do that micro-challenge right now.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.009 align:middle line:90%
OK so the way that I'm going to do it is I'm
going to go 3D object / cube like that and

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.979 align:middle line:90%
then I'm just going to scale it. Now the scale
in x is going to be 105 because that's the

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:90%
width of the lane; y what 20cm high something
like that and then how deep? What, 5cm? 10cm?

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.509 align:middle line:90%
If in doubt make it thick because it's going
to make sure that it collides because at high

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:90%
speed sometimes things don't collide so I'm
going to make mine 10cm thick and 40 or 30cm

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:90%
high, let's say 30, those proportions look
OK.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.039 align:middle line:90%
So there it is. Later on, or if you want to
now you can put some materials on here that

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.419 align:middle line:90%
make it look more like glass but for now that's
fine. Of course you need to position it so

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.229 align:middle line:90%
that it's at 0x, right in the middle of the
lane and then we need to make a judgement

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.509 align:middle line:90%
call on whether it's at the right height,
I think that I'm going to lift mine up to

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:53.009 align:middle line:90%
I think 80 cm and we may as well have a nice
round z position. Now remember the trick,

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:90%
you can click on the letter z and drag left
and right and watch how it affects the numbers

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.319 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to make mine at 1750 I think.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:90%
OK perfect, so we now have a cube but this
is actually called a swiper so name the object.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:90%
So at least we have a swiper in place now.
So the next thing to do is think about how

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:90%
we're going to set up our animation. Let's
look at our hierarchy, we have a camera and

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:90%
a main camera and a directional light and
a floor, a load of pins and a ball. Well I

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:90%
would say that the floor and the swiper are
both part of a more general thing called the

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:90%
lane, so why don't we create an empty object
and just call it lane?

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Now provided that you reset the transform
of that empty game object you can then drag

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:90%
in the swiper and the floor without any negative
effects, you're just grouping the floor and

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:90%
the swiper together and saying that they're
all just part of the lane as a whole. They're

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.009 align:middle line:90%
not part of the pins, the pins are separate
to the lane, so is the ball, that lot's all

00:07:54.009 --> 00:08:01.389 align:middle line:90%
part of the bowling alley or the lane. OK
fine, that's good, now we need to put an animator

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:90%
on something so that it can move around the
swiper. Now, put the animator on the most

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:84%
specific thing that you can.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.699 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you could put the animator on the lane,
that would work, and then you could reach

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:90%
in to the swiper object; but ask yourself
do we have anything else to animate in this

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:90%
lane? Well there's a design decision there
for you. If for example you had some of those

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:90%
kids' gutter bars down the side left and right
that could pop up, they could pop up as an

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:90%
animation so it may make sense to keep things
simple to have a single animator on the lane

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:40.589 align:middle line:90%
and then it would be able to access the swiper,
maybe the gutter bars if we had them, so that

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:41.060 align:middle line:84%
would be fine.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.779 align:middle line:90%
The cost of that is that it would be a little
more cumbersome to use the animator, the other

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:90%
option is that you put the animator on the
swiper itself and have a dedicated animator

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:90%
for the swiper so it's entirely up to you
which way you do that. In my case I'm going

00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:90%
to take my own advice and put my animator
on the swiper, the most specific object. So

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:90%
let's go ahead and do that. There is an animator.
Now the other thing that you're going to need

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:90%
on this swiper if it's actually going to impact
with the pins is you're going to need yourself

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:84%
a RigidBody.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:90%
It already has a box collider but no physics
collisions will be exhibited unless you have

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:90%
a RigidBody as well. We certainly don't want
it to be a trigger, it's a lot more than that,

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:27.519 align:middle line:90%
it is a fully physical object but let's add
a RigidBody. A 3D RigidBody these days. We

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:90%
don't need gravity on that RigidBody and I
personally like to move that up the hierarchy

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:90%
to sit next to the collider just so that at
a glance I can see that this is a RigidBody

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:90%
collider, but it is kinematic, we are going
to be specifying the motion through the animator.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.209 align:middle line:90%
Alright so that's the right type of object,
now your challenge is going to be to actually

00:09:50.209 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:90%
use the animator to make that type of swipe
animation that you saw ensuring that in doing

00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:90%
so you'll actually swipe the pins out of the
way. So go ahead and do that now, create a

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:90%
swipe animation. Be careful not to hit any
raised pins on your way down or back, you'll

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:90%
need enough key frames to kind of go around
the bend; and then go out and back smoothly.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:90%
So pause the video and make an animation similar
to what you saw in my prototype right now,

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see you when you're ready.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.399 align:middle line:90%
OK cool welcome back so this is how I'm going
to add the swipe animation, let's go to the

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:90%
swiper and let's get ourselves in an animation
layout. Now have you saved an animation layout?

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Not since I upgraded to Unity 5. So I'm going
to get the windows that I need, I want an

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:39.079 align:middle line:90%
animation window and I like to have that up
here and then I want another window which

00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:90%
is the animator and that animator which gives
me all of my animation states I like to have

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:90%
down the bottom here and then that layout
I'm going to save as animation. Entirely up

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:90%
to you how you workflow this but now I can
quickly switch to this animation layout in

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:90%
future and that just went because of Unity
5.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:04.579 align:middle line:90%
Cool, so our swiper has an animator on it.
But is has no animation controller so let's

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:90%
start getting ourselves a little tidier. Create
a folder called animations - if you like,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:90%
you can organise this how you like - and create
yourself a new animation controller. I'm going

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.459 align:middle line:90%
to call it swiper, because that's what's being
animated, and you can drag it onto the swiper

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:90%
like that. Now, the system is intelligent
enough to know that you want the animation

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:30.620 align:middle line:90%
controller here, that you just created, to
go into the animator of the swiper, so that's

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:90%
cool. Now, if you clicked on the animator
then we have this empty state machine view

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:90%
here, you can use the middle mouse button
or the mouse wheel to drag around this thing.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
We have no animation clips right now, or states.
So let's create ourselves an empty state called

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:90%
idle. So we'll organise our animations into
sub-state machines and stuff later in a future

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:90%
video, for now let's just focus on getting
this swipe animation working properly so you

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:90%
can create a new empty state here, call it
swipe, it can be moved into a lower level

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:90%
later. It doesn't have a motion, so let's
make a motion. Create / animation and just

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:90%
call it swipe. So back at your animator swipe
can now be given a swipe motion, perfect;

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and then we need a way of getting into swipe.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.829 align:middle line:90%
Well I'm just going to make the transition
happen by default, so if you click play it

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:33.339 align:middle line:90%
goes idle and then swipe. Alright? That's
absolutely fine for testing purposes. Remember

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
we're going to reorganise this state machine
later. The focus of this video is to get the

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:90%
swipe animation working properly. So you need
to be clicked on the swiper and now you need

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:90%
the clip swipe, and this is where we actually
model the animation. So if you click record

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:90%
here, remember that you can just switch between
the animation and the scene to apply your

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:84%
key frames.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:90%
So at the start we need a key frame which
is where the swiper is where it is - right

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:90%
at the top there, that's fine. So maybe after
one second we add a key frame, but a key frame

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:90%
what? It's all very well to just add a key
frame but you need to be changing a particular

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:19.649 align:middle line:90%
property and that property is the position
of the swiper. So at the start, there, when

00:13:19.649 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:90%
you look at the scene the swiper's here. Now
at, say, one second, we go over to the scene

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:29.639 align:middle line:90%
and we move it to where we want it. We want
it to be down a bit and forward a bit. Now

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:32.209 align:middle line:90%
bear in mind it will smooth the corners of
these motions.

00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:39.649 align:middle line:90%
So if we play that at the moment... to there,
that's OK. So now you just have to go in and

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:43.389 align:middle line:90%
put the rest of your key frames in. So maybe
I'm going to spend another two seconds getting

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:49.199 align:middle line:90%
myself to the back. So what do I mean by the
back? I want to get to this kind of position,

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:53.839 align:middle line:90%
something like this at the back here right.
Low enough to make sure that we swipe everything,

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:59.889 align:middle line:90%
great, and then maybe two seconds later over
here somewhere we add a new keyframe and maybe

00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
we want to be back at the start by then.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:07.389 align:middle line:90%
Or near the start, back here perhaps; and
then maybe we need a final keyframe maybe

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:90%
a second later giving us a 6 second total
animation that is back right at the beginning.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:90%
But if you leave that keyframe off to start
with never have overlapping keyframes because

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:90%
there's a risk that you'll have glitching
then. So let's just see how that works if

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:90%
you don't have that final keyframe in. It
goes along, it swipes them out of the way,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:29.949 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't move far enough back and it doesn't
return to the start position so we are going

00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:90%
to need a keyframe to return to the start
position but it's always worth checking that.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:90%
So, copy those keyframes of the start position
to be safe, and then paste them where you

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.519 align:middle line:90%
want them so that you know that they're in
the right position. Also the end position

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
which I believe is here simply isn't far enough
back to swipe them off the back of the lane.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:90%
There you go, let's take a look at this animation
now. Again all of this can be improved later

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:90%
but look, that's pretty cool, it swipes them
off the back, it's going through the floor.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Why is it going through the floor? Let's just
take a look at that.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.149 align:middle line:90%
So key frames tell you most of the story but
they don't tell you the entire story. What

00:15:04.149 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:90%
helps is to go to curves and what curves is
going to do is to tell you how the system

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:90%
is interpolating between these points and
the problem is here and here where the swiper

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:90%
is going too low. So how are we going to deal
with that? Well you could just play with your

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:90%
curves here and make sure that your swiper
doesn't go through the floor and also doesn't

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:90%
clip the pins. You see what I'm doing? So
that's curves there, so the dope sheet is

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:90%
what are the positions and when but the curves
is additional information. In addition to

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that, OK?

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.889 align:middle line:90%
So and you've got two different curves here,
what are they for? They're for the x position

00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:90%
and the y position and the z position of the
swiper. So its x position doesn't want to

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.360 align:middle line:90%
change, its y position, up and down, does
want to change in a fairly smooth curve like

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:90%
that and at the same time that that's happening
the z position wants to change backwards and

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:90%
forwards. Pretty cool, eh? and you can see
them all together like this, although there's

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:90%
a scaling issue because it moves a lot further
in z than it does in x.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take a look and see how that adjustment
to the curves has worked - down, swipes the

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:90%
pins, doesn't go through the floor and smoothly
comes back. How cool is that? We may need

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:90%
to adjust it later but for the moment we have
achieved what we want to achieve for this

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.829 align:middle line:90%
video which is creating our swiper animation.
So I look forward to seeing yours, you can

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:90%
make your movement a load more funky you can
make this guy spin and dance and do whatever

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:90%
you like but the point is we have an animation
ready for future work so congratulations and

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll see you soon.
