00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.430 align:middle line:90%
So hi. and welcome to your first real game.
We're going to be jumping into creating a

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.980 align:middle line:90%
ten-pin bowling game all in 3D to get you
introduced to all the 3D concepts that you're

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:90%
going to be needing to build more complex
games. So it's quite cool. it's a pretty simple

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.449 align:middle line:90%
game that you'll have fun playing and have
fun making and it's got some scope to create

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:90%
your own stuff. So what can they create in
that game that's their own really?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.219 align:middle line:90%
Well you could customise the lane itself.
you could put an image down across the lane;

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.289 align:middle line:90%
you can make your own pins. even if you just
want to use primitives at this stage which

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.629 align:middle line:90%
is fine. maybe just a sphere on top of a cube
or a cuboid. that's absolutely fine. If you

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.089 align:middle line:90%
want to be more sophisticated and you know
something about blender. or another program

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:90%
for creating 3D art meshes and 3D art then
go ahead and do that. and just share and just

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.639 align:middle line:90%
have fun with this. We've chosen this game
because you can get a surprisingly rich emergent

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:01.659 align:middle line:90%
behaviour using Unity's physics engine for
relatively little input and we think that

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:90%
it's a good starting point 3D entry into your
programming. So enjoy this section. anything

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:90%
else they're going to learn in here Brice
we should know about?

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:90%
No. I have a request for you guys though.
if you are going to be modelling your own

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:90%
things I want you to model some garden gnomes.
I want to be ten pin bowling with some garden

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:90%
gnomes. So have fun with that if you want
to take up the challenge.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Please. I'd like to knock over some gnomes.
See you soon.
