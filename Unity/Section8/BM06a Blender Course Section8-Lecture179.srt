Hey guys. Ben and Michael back! You may remember

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Michael from earlier in the course. my 3D artist friend.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So it's a this stage that. we really need some 3D assets. and this time

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we need a bowling ball and a bowling pin. Of course. I've provided them for you.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but guess who made them? Hi! It was me!

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Mikey made them! So. over in the Complete Blender Creator. we

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
take you through actually making exactly that bowling ball

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and pin and showing you how to customize it to your own needs and import it

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
into Unity. Yes. So. what are the basics. Mikey. of making something

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
like let's say the bowling pin? How do we get that shape over in Blender? Well. we

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
use a system called Bezier Curves. and then. it makes

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a nice smooth finish. around our pin itself.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so we make our pin from that. But with

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Unity you cannot just use this really high polygon

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
model. lovely pin. to collide

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with. because that ball is going to be rolling forward and hitting that

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
pin. And so. we're also going to teach you how to make a Collider Mesh. to go

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
along with your wonderful 3D assets. as well.

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So. to clarify on that. specifically. Unity has a 255

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
polygon limit on Collider Meshes.

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So. we want a mesh that very much replicates the shape of the pin.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but you're going to see that we can't just us the Full Render Mesh. because it's

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
just to high polygon. So. Michael actually. over in the course

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and in supplied assets. is going to create two meshes. A

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Visual Mesh and a Physics Mesh and put them into the same model.

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So. here is a second opportunity. and it's the only other

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
time I'm going to mention it in this course. apart from the very end. for you to go over

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
into the Complete Blender Creator and get yourself learning

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Blender. in parallel with this course so you can actually create assets

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
as you go. So. the URL is udemy.com/

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
blendertutorial. The coupon code you need is.

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Unity Student Special. and that will give you the cheapest price that we're going to offer

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
on this. And I hope you decide to take that course as well. It's every

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
bit as good as this Unity course! Take care guys!

35
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.100
Hope to see you there!
