00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Hi and welcome back. So in this video were
going to be importing a bowling pin from Blender.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.330 align:middle line:90%
learn about render and collider meshes. create
a pin prefab. and lay out all of our ten bowling

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:90%
pins on the floor according to the GDD. So
you can find out more about Blender at www.CompleteBlenderCreator.com.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:90%
I've teamed up with an old friend and 3D artist
Michael Bridges to bring a huge course similar

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:90%
to this one to you called the Complete Blender
Creator because it's such an important skill

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:90%
now that we're moving into 3D to be able to
manipulate meshes. so go out and take a look

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.559 align:middle line:84%
at www.CompleteBlenderCreator.com.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:90%
So. that's the challenge that we're going
to be doing a little later but for now let's

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:90%
just take a look around. In your start pack.
if you haven't already got your start pack

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:90%
for instance if you created your own floor
then go and get it now; import package / custom

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.829 align:middle line:90%
package and then navigate your way to your
BowlMaster assets at the beginning of this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.539 align:middle line:90%
section and there's a Unity section there
that you can import. In there you'll find

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Blender imports and there's a bowling pin.
Try just dragging that bowling pin from your

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.369 align:middle line:90%
Blender imports to the scene. It's going to
look a bit weird to start with and I'll explain

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:84%
why in a moment.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Drag it in and drop it. look at this default
shadowing in Unity 5. by default. That's really

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:90%
cool. So. what do we do when we drop a new
3D asset in? Well. firstly we need to make

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.439 align:middle line:90%
sure that it looks right. Now because Blender
and Unity play together nicely. and this bowling

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:90%
pin has been set up nicely or fairly nicely
over in Blender. we can actually get the two

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:90%
to play together very easily. So what have
we got here? We have a bowling pin and what

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:90%
is it? Well it's a transform and an animator
for now. Well we don't really need an animator

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
so we could remove that component.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.509 align:middle line:90%
Then let's look in and see what the subcomponents
are. Well we have a pin collider. So we have

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:90%
a collider mesh and that's the funny purple
things you're seeing there and then we have

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:90%
a renderer on that collider mesh we don't
need that. So the collider mesh is the mesh

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be responsible for calculating
how this pin interacts with other pins. So

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
you can remove the renderer mesh from the
collider sub-object. You'll understand all

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:90%
this a bit better in a bit. but basically
we just need a coarse collider mesh on there.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.569 align:middle line:90%
and when we add a collider itself. let's do
that now. add a mesh collider.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.440 align:middle line:90%
There you go. so you're looking at the bowling
pin its pin collider sub-component and add

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:90%
a component called a mesh collider. There
it is. So that mesh is of a lower detail than

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:90%
the render mesh. So if you zoom in to the
pin by rolling in as we showed you then look

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.069 align:middle line:90%
at the triangles in the render mesh. in the
blue here compared to all the triangles in

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:90%
the collider mesh; a much more coarse mesh
and there's a good reason for that. In order

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
to make the pin interact and bounce off other
pins the mesh needs to be something called

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
convex which means that it has no concave
elements like this curve here like the waistline

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
of the pin.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:90%
If it's not convex then this pin will not
be able to hit other pins it's a performance

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:90%
optimisation element of Unity. So we need
to click convex. So on your bowling pin pin

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:90%
collider your mesh collider element click
convex and it'll immediately become convex

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.209 align:middle line:90%
like that. which is great. You wouldn't be
able to do that with the render mesh because

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.860 align:middle line:90%
if you look at the documentation for a mesh
collider and then look up convex - there you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:90%
go convex - if enabled then mesh collider
will collide with other mesh colliders. we

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
need that. we need pins to collide with pins
but they are limited to 255 triangles.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.349 align:middle line:90%
SO Michael has kindly when he made this bowling
pin made us two separate meshes - one to make

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.599 align:middle line:90%
it look prettier. which is the render mesh.
and then another for the collider mesh that

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:90%
we are now making convex. So the end state
of your collider should be no renderer - we

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:90%
don't need to render the collider. we don't
need to see it; convex and looking something

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
like that. Now it's not perfect. it's not
going to collide exactly like pins do because

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:90%
it's going to act like it's impacting things
even right out here to the sides of the mesh

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:90%
but that's the limitation that we have with
Unity and convex meshes; and then if you look

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.019 align:middle line:84%
at the rendered that's doing fine.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Now you'll notice that again because the asset
was set up nicely in Blender to import it's

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%
got several things on it. It has a mesh and
then a mesh renderer but then it has also

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:90%
populated this materials array with two different
materials now. we have a material for the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:90%
majority of the pin which is white. which
you can see here. under material element zero.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:90%
pin body. and then material element one which
is pin stripe. Now if you're wondering where

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
those materials exist well they're in this
materials subfolder automatically and they

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:90%
are just plain red and white albedo materials
just like the floor. but just plain white

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and red.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.810 align:middle line:90%
OK the other things that you'll see in this
Blender object when you expand it out with

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:90%
the little triangle is a default take here
which is to do with animation and also a bowling

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.699 align:middle line:90%
pin avatar again also used for animation.
They come across by default; we don't need

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:90%
to use them. Fantastic so we have a single
pin which is great news. Let's go and put

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:90%
the single pin where it should be now. If
I remember rightly it's in the middle x. y

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:90%
well I believe should be 0. right on the floor
let's just check that this is going to depend

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.380 align:middle line:90%
on the pivot point of your 3D object. Yep
that's on the floor. Now if you're adventurous

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and you want to have a play with this pin
your second customisation point for this game

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:90%
after you've made us a different and much
more interesting lane is to double click on

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:90%
your bowling pin if you've got Blender installed.
get into Blender. and to modify this pin and

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to make it your own.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Now Blender can be a bit of a face full to
get used to and that is exactly why we have

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.449 align:middle line:90%
created this course. You have issues in here
with this interface and how to get a handle

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:90%
on it. I find it really tricky but that's
why we're making a course on it. Anyway try

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and find another bowling pin or modify this
bowling pin if you can at least change the

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:90%
colours of these stripes. that is simple to
do. right you just go into the pin render

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.080 align:middle line:90%
material here and you could go to the stripe
material and you could go into here and you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.789 align:middle line:84%
could change it to let's say a blue stripe.

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Alright? So at least customise the colours.
if you really want to get detailed you could

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:90%
go into here and you could start putting a
texture onto the pin itself and have a play

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:90%
around with all of how that works and the
pin properties. Great opportunity for you

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.229 align:middle line:90%
to create and explore and make a mess. OK.
so we have a pin. It lives at 0. 0 and then

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:90%
1829 was the position of the head pin I believe
from the document. Let's go focus down on

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:90%
that pin. OK so the z position is negative
and that's fine. we can have all of our z

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:90%
positions in the negative. or. you can switch
your play space around so you need to decide

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:90%
now do you want to be dealing with negative
z's or do you want to have positive z's from

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.349 align:middle line:84%
the line that you launch?

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:56.099 align:middle line:90%
Well I want to be dealing with positives.
so let's move our floor. so firstly I'm going

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:90%
to rename my floor object so it's more clear
what it is. I'm going to move my bowling pin

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom just for tidiness and now we
need to look at where this floor object is.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:90%
well it's 20m long but it centres in the middle
here. What I actually want to do is move it

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:90%
out in the z like that so the line that you
launch your ball from is right at the origin

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:90%
here. So we need to be minus a thousand centimetres
here and the effect that that has if we put

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:90%
a reference cube in - game object / 3D / cube
and then reset that cube. remember that this

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
is a one by one centimetre cube.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Where is it? Well let's take a look - its
right there. it's one hundredth of the width

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.639 align:middle line:90%
of the play space and it's right at the bowling
launch line. Perfect. The other thing that

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:90%
we can do with this reference cube of course.
being one centimetre tall is to move it up

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:90%
one centimetre like that and then to move
it to 1829 in the z direction. so that it's

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:90%
sitting right next to the pin. Now it's moved
in positive z. look at this little gizmo at

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.879 align:middle line:90%
the top here. and our playspace disappears
into negative z so you need to be careful

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.349 align:middle line:84%
with your positives and negatives.

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:90%
I think that the whole game would be a lot
easier to manage if the playspace. i.e. the

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:90%
floor. went not into negative z but into positive
z. So these are the sort of fiddling around

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.919 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to have to do. OK what have
we got now? We've got a bowling pin that shouldn't

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:90%
be at 1829 negative but positive. we're just
flipping our entire playspace around. Where's

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.009 align:middle line:90%
the camera? Well. it's kind of in the wrong
place now but that's fine. we can go to the

00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:30.199 align:middle line:90%
end of the playspace. this is a good chance
for you to navigate. or we could either go

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:36.680 align:middle line:90%
to the end of the playspace. spin around.
and then align the camera with the view. or

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
we could do this from the inspector.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
We could say that we want the camera to be
at y = 5. that was fine before. it could be

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
at x = 0. right in the middle of the lane.
and then at z = 0. and then where's the camera?

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Well let's just take a look at it in the scene
view. Do a bit of moving around with the right

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:90%
mouse button. click on the camera to visualise
it. there it is. So the problem with it right

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.399 align:middle line:90%
now is its rotation around the y axis. How
do you know that? Well look at these axis

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:08.649 align:middle line:90%
indicators here. it's the y axis that we need
to spin it around. 180 degrees. there you

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:90%
go; and the camera preview looks about right.
and actually it's great. we're looking down

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:84%
the lane.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:90%
So now the position of our camera. if we set
it to 0 z. is right at the launch point of

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.649 align:middle line:90%
the lane. We can't see the pins at the end
now. why not? Well because the camera viewport

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:90%
is too wide. We need to zoom our camera in
a little bit. Click on the camera again. maybe

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
go into game view so that you can see what
you're doing. and just turn the field of view

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:90%
of the camera down. OK? And then again you're
going to have to adjust it a little bit until

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:90%
you can actually see what's going on. So get
used to manipulating these objects. move the

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.279 align:middle line:90%
camera viewpoint up; now what's wrong? Well
the camera has a far point clipping plane

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:90%
of a thousand which is how far it can see.
Why don't we say 2.500? There you go.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Now it can see out to 25 metres distance.
and you can see that reflected here; you see

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:90%
as I move this far point. you see it moving?
So beyond that things aren't rendered for

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:84%
this camera. it's like the fog of war.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:90%
So if your camera is sitting now at the start
point. basically at the origin but lifted

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.279 align:middle line:90%
up a little bit by 25 cm off the deck - maybe
we should go higher than that. maybe we should

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:21.399 align:middle line:90%
go 150 cm off the deck. more like a human
height. Sounds like a good idea but it just

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:90%
doesn't look right with this zoomed in camera
so I'm going to put it back down to where

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:90%
it was. You see sometimes you just have to
be non-realistic and just play with things.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.279 align:middle line:90%
Is it right in the middle x-wise? No it could
be. that'll be fine. Probably more boring

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:90%
if it is. and we could play with the camera
more later. You get the idea. we want it at

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.910 align:middle line:90%
the origin. looking down the lane. the lane
wants to extend from the origin. i.e. 0.0.0

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:46.649 align:middle line:90%
all the way down. 20 metres in the positive
z direction as indicated here. the floor is

00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:90%
at 0.0.1000 because it's 20 metres long. it
has to be offset by a thousand.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Where's this reference cube? Itâs right
down here. actually inside the pin at the

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:90%
moment. so letâs go to the translate tool
which is up here. and just move it next to

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
the pin now it needs to be at y = 1. there
you go. and now you can check and see is this

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:90%
guy roughly the right size? Well how big was
the pin supposed to be? Well twenty something

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:90%
centimetres right? So why not scale your cube
20 cm and move it up 10cm? And that's 20cm

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:25.450 align:middle line:90%
so you can check against your game design
document how big your pin should be and just

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:90%
use physical objects as measuring sticks if
you want.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere here we have a pin specification.
here you go. It should be 38 cm tall. So over

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:90%
in Unity if we set the y scale to 38 half
of that's going to be under the floor. so

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:90%
we need to move it up by 15 _4 or half of
38 which is 19 so it sits perfectly on the

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:90%
ground. you see right there and you see that
is the height of the pin or thereabouts. So

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:90%
great. measuring stick. That's what I used
the cube for. Just to get a handle on what

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:90%
this space is. Remember we're choosing for
our units to mean centimetres. they have no

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
meaning until we give them one.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:07.029 align:middle line:90%
Great. so we have the pin in. let's take you
onto your challenge right now. So I want you

00:12:07.029 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:90%
to find your own pin. or modify the pin if
you want to. otherwise use ours from the assets.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:90%
ensure that the dimensions match. or are close
to the GDD. test that the pin sits on the

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:90%
lane properly like we have there and set up
all ten pins according to the game design

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:90%
document that means lay them out and that's
a bit of a hassle but it only needs to be

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:90%
done once because we'll prefab the pin set
up. So go ahead. get all that done and I will

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
see you in a moment.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.839 align:middle line:90%
Cool welcome back. so now it's just a question
of firstly I just need to make sure that the

00:12:42.839 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:90%
pin actually collides with the floor. so that
it will let me play the game here. and the

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:52.399 align:middle line:90%
pin well. it probably does collide with the
floor but there's no gravity on it yet. We'll

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:56.459 align:middle line:90%
deal with the physics of the pin in a little
bit but for now all I needed you to do was

00:12:56.459 --> 00:13:00.839 align:middle line:90%
to make sure that they sit on the floor graphically.
If you've been a little more advanced and

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:90%
already added a rigidbdy to the pin and noticed
that it falls to the floor then extra bonus.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
but let's cover the physics of the pin in
a separate video.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Cool. so for now we need to just replicate
these pins in such a way that they match the

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.950 align:middle line:90%
game design document for the pin layout. So
that's at the beginning of this section. you

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:90%
have this document here and we have a 30.48cm
spacing between them sideways and a 52.71

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:90%
spacing this way. That's a bit weird. So how
are we going to do that? Well I like to have

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:41.399 align:middle line:90%
an empty parent object called pins. and it's
good practice to pop that at the origin. Or.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:90%
to pop it at the position of the head pin
actually. which is what I'm going to do. 1829

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.449 align:middle line:84%
so it's here. the game object is there.

00:13:48.449 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Then when I move the bowling pin into it.
it's offset the head pin is not offset at

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.279 align:middle line:90%
all from the pins object so the pins object
is relative to that headpin. Now it's just

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:90%
a question of duplicating the pin. and actually
what would be useful because it's going to

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:90%
auto-number the pins for you is why not delete
that first one and just duplicate like this

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:90%
- 2. and then bring it back put it roughly
in place. duplicate splodge d. 3. again command

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:90%
or control d. you see the idea here and we
can just duplicate these pins out moving them

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.279 align:middle line:90%
into roughly the right position I suggest
is a good idea. Careful about using this box

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:29.949 align:middle line:90%
translator as it'll move it in 3 dimensions
and that will be confusing. So it's probably

00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:90%
easier just to use your red and your blue
handles; and also remember that you can move

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:90%
your viewpoint. don't fight in a 3D view if
you don't need to be; and now you could actually

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:90%
label these exactly as they should be so if
this is pin 1. 2 and 3 as we look from above.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:51.740 align:middle line:90%
why not spin it around. get above it and then
make sure we're doing pin 1. 2 you see two

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:90%
and three are round the wrong way as such
so let's just get them right.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:90%
1. 2. 3. and then 4. 5 is inside four at the
moment because of the way that I duplicated

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:11.079 align:middle line:90%
it. we're just going to do a rough layout
to start with. then six and the beauty of

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:90%
duplicating these after deleting the first
pin is that they auto-number. isn't that easy.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Seven. eight and I suggest immediately that
you duplicate them that you move the new object

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:90%
out so it doesn't end up too confused. and
there you go we have a set of pins. Now they're

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:90%
not lined up perfectly. and that's not surprising
because we havenât yet actually inspected

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.009 align:middle line:84%
them to line them up perfectly.

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:90%
So how are we going to do that? How are we
going to make sure that the pins are in exactly

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.389 align:middle line:90%
the right positions? Well you just need to
go through and do a little bit of calculation.

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:44.959 align:middle line:90%
so if it's - looking at this vertical dimension
looking from pin 3 to 9 that's going to be

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:49.029 align:middle line:90%
the same as the dimension from pin 1 to 5
so let's start there with number one; and

00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:90%
we need to make sure that the dimension 9
to 3 or 3 to 9 is 52.71 cm. let's remember

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:90%
52.71 so we need pin 5 to be 52.71 cm back
from pin 0.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:90%
So pin 0 is at 0. 0. 0 relative to the pin
array. which is a nice. that's the head pin

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:15.899 align:middle line:90%
so that makes sense. Pin 5 we want to be at
x = 0. y = 0 because we want it sitting on

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:90%
the floor but 52.71 back. Now to me that looks
like that's too far back but no but it's OK.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:90%
it's just a bigger gap than we expect. This
pin has ended up all the way back here. That

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
seems like it's a long way back to me. in
fact that is too long a way back for sure.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:39.199 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take a look where pin 2 would be.
that would put pin 2 maybe it is OK?

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Pin 2 there. pin 3 here. yeah maybe that's
fine. So pin 4 would come down here. see a

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:90%
messy business of just laying out the pins
roughly right in the first place and then

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:55.209 align:middle line:90%
we just have to move the back layer of pins
all the way back and you could actually multi-select

00:16:55.209 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:90%
those to do that by holding down command.
OK. so maybe they are that spaced out. It

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.870 align:middle line:90%
feels a little bit odd. looks a little bit
odd. but let's make sure that it works. Pin

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:90%
1 is at 0. 0. 0. pin 5 is the first one that
we have a handle on is at 0.0.52.71. That's

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.199 align:middle line:84%
what it says. let's just keep going then.

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:90%
So we have 30.48cm sideways between two pins.
So that means we have 15.24cm is half of that.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:90%
right? So that's where this guy needs to be.
pin 2 needs to be at -15.24 going half the

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:90%
distance sideways and then how far back? Well
half of 52.71 now we're stretching my mental

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:90%
calculations a little bit so let's just use
a calculator. 26.355 you may as well copy

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:90%
that from your calculator to be precise. and
just pop it in here. There you go. So it's

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:90%
pretty obvious now what pin number 3 is going
to be. it's going to be the same type of thing

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:90%
as number 2 but with the opposite x co-ordinate
so 15.24.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
OK look. now I'm not going to bore you by
going through and showing you the final layout

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:90%
of these pins so I'm just going to cut to
the end result where I've applied the same

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:14.809 align:middle line:90%
calculation to make sure that all these pins
are in the perfect positions. So a couple

00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:21.669 align:middle line:90%
more tips to help you with this. I've laid
out most of my pins I just want to show you

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:90%
two more options. one is don't be afraid to
delete pins if you find that it's going to

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:33.660 align:middle line:90%
be easier just to duplicate like that perhaps
and then move this guy across maybe to 15.2.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that's one option for you.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:90%
The other thing that you can do if you have
a rough set pin like this pin number ten here.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:48.049 align:middle line:90%
let's imagine that it's in a weird position
like so. and you say well it's pretty much

00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:90%
the same position as this guy. he's just the
opposite x component. what you could do is

00:18:53.870 --> 00:19:00.039 align:middle line:90%
go to the transform of say pin 7 or whichever
one. copy the component. that copies the whole

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:90%
transform component. click on the destination
pin and paste component values and it will

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.179 align:middle line:90%
snap right on the top of this guy and then
if you remove the negative then that's another

00:19:10.179 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:84%
way of doing it.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.289 align:middle line:90%
Now if you still think that this looks weird
then you can change your camera from perspective

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:19.100 align:middle line:90%
to isometric. Now perspective is obviously
how we see the world. isometric is like a

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.360 align:middle line:90%
camera at infinity and now there is no perspective.
and actually from this point of view it's

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:90%
all looking a lot more sensible in the perspective
view and maybe down here they look too spread

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:90%
out but we're just so used to seeing bins
from down here that it just doesn't match

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:90%
our intuition. It looks a lot better down
here right? Again isometric here looks weird

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:90%
but perspective here looks right. and isometric
from above looks right as well.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:90%
So congratulations! All our pins are laid
out beautifully in the play space and if we

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:90%
look at our game camera you can see something
looking like a bowling lane and we have a

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:90%
master game object so perfect! Well done looking
=======

00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:10,080 align:middle line:90%
Hi and welcome back. So in this video were
going to be importing a bowling pin from Blender,

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,330 align:middle line:90%
learn about render and collider meshes, create
a pin prefab, and lay out all of our ten bowling

00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,920 align:middle line:90%
pins on the floor according to the GDD. So
you can find out more about Blender at www.CompleteBlenderCreator.com,

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,640 align:middle line:90%
I've teamed up with an old friend and 3D artist
Michael Bridges to bring a huge course similar

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,250 align:middle line:90%
to this one to you called the Complete Blender
Creator because it's such an important skill

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,500 align:middle line:90%
now that we're moving into 3D to be able to
manipulate meshes, so go out and take a look

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,559 align:middle line:84%
at www.CompleteBlenderCreator.com.

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,290 align:middle line:90%
So, that's the challenge that we're going
to be doing a little later but for now let's

00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,750 align:middle line:90%
just take a look around. In your start pack,
if you haven't already got your start pack

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,980 align:middle line:90%
for instance if you created your own floor
then go and get it now; import package / custom

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,829 align:middle line:90%
package and then navigate your way to your
BowlMaster assets at the beginning of this

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,539 align:middle line:90%
section and there's a Unity section there
that you can import. In there you'll find

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,720 align:middle line:90%
Blender imports and there's a bowling pin.
Try just dragging that bowling pin from your

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,369 align:middle line:90%
Blender imports to the scene. It's going to
look a bit weird to start with and I'll explain

00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:10,920 align:middle line:84%
why in a moment.

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,540 align:middle line:90%
Drag it in and drop it, look at this default
shadowing in Unity 5, by default. That's really

00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,970 align:middle line:90%
cool. So, what do we do when we drop a new
3D asset in? Well, firstly we need to make

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,439 align:middle line:90%
sure that it looks right. Now because Blender
and Unity play together nicely, and this bowling

00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:32,720 align:middle line:90%
pin has been set up nicely or fairly nicely
over in Blender, we can actually get the two

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,140 align:middle line:90%
to play together very easily. So what have
we got here? We have a bowling pin and what

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,880 align:middle line:90%
is it? Well it's a transform and an animator
for now. Well we don't really need an animator

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,320 align:middle line:84%
so we could remove that component.

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,509 align:middle line:90%
Then let's look in and see what the subcomponents
are. Well we have a pin collider. So we have

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,750 align:middle line:90%
a collider mesh and that's the funny purple
things you're seeing there and then we have

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,020 align:middle line:90%
a renderer on that collider mesh we don't
need that. So the collider mesh is the mesh

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,020 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be responsible for calculating
how this pin interacts with other pins. So

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,780 align:middle line:90%
you can remove the renderer mesh from the
collider sub-object. You'll understand all

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,110 align:middle line:90%
this a bit better in a bit, but basically
we just need a coarse collider mesh on there,

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,569 align:middle line:90%
and when we add a collider itself, let's do
that now, add a mesh collider.

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,440 align:middle line:90%
There you go, so you're looking at the bowling
pin its pin collider sub-component and add

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,900 align:middle line:90%
a component called a mesh collider. There
it is. So that mesh is of a lower detail than

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,400 align:middle line:90%
the render mesh. So if you zoom in to the
pin by rolling in as we showed you then look

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,069 align:middle line:90%
at the triangles in the render mesh, in the
blue here compared to all the triangles in

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,730 align:middle line:90%
the collider mesh; a much more coarse mesh
and there's a good reason for that. In order

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,910 align:middle line:90%
to make the pin interact and bounce off other
pins the mesh needs to be something called

00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,610 align:middle line:90%
convex which means that it has no concave
elements like this curve here like the waistline

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,120 align:middle line:84%
of the pin.

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,430 align:middle line:90%
If it's not convex then this pin will not
be able to hit other pins it's a performance

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,650 align:middle line:90%
optimisation element of Unity. So we need
to click convex. So on your bowling pin pin

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,150 align:middle line:90%
collider your mesh collider element click
convex and it'll immediately become convex

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,209 align:middle line:90%
like that, which is great. You wouldn't be
able to do that with the render mesh because

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,860 align:middle line:90%
if you look at the documentation for a mesh
collider and then look up convex - there you

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,580 align:middle line:90%
go convex - if enabled then mesh collider
will collide with other mesh colliders, we

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,790 align:middle line:90%
need that, we need pins to collide with pins
but they are limited to 255 triangles.

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,349 align:middle line:90%
SO Michael has kindly when he made this bowling
pin made us two separate meshes - one to make

00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,599 align:middle line:90%
it look prettier, which is the render mesh,
and then another for the collider mesh that

00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,760 align:middle line:90%
we are now making convex. So the end state
of your collider should be no renderer - we

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,750 align:middle line:90%
don't need to render the collider, we don't
need to see it; convex and looking something

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,510 align:middle line:90%
like that. Now it's not perfect, it's not
going to collide exactly like pins do because

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,500 align:middle line:90%
it's going to act like it's impacting things
even right out here to the sides of the mesh

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,290 align:middle line:90%
but that's the limitation that we have with
Unity and convex meshes; and then if you look

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,019 align:middle line:84%
at the rendered that's doing fine.

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,600 align:middle line:90%
Now you'll notice that again because the asset
was set up nicely in Blender to import it's

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,910 align:middle line:90%
got several things on it. It has a mesh and
then a mesh renderer but then it has also

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,610 align:middle line:90%
populated this materials array with two different
materials now, we have a material for the

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,110 align:middle line:90%
majority of the pin which is white, which
you can see here, under material element zero,

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,550 align:middle line:90%
pin body, and then material element one which
is pin stripe. Now if you're wondering where

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,940 align:middle line:90%
those materials exist well they're in this
materials subfolder automatically and they

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,060 align:middle line:90%
are just plain red and white albedo materials
just like the floor, but just plain white

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,100 align:middle line:84%
and red.

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,810 align:middle line:90%
OK the other things that you'll see in this
Blender object when you expand it out with

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,900 align:middle line:90%
the little triangle is a default take here
which is to do with animation and also a bowling

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,699 align:middle line:90%
pin avatar again also used for animation.
They come across by default; we don't need

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:06,800 align:middle line:90%
to use them. Fantastic so we have a single
pin which is great news. Let's go and put

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,600 align:middle line:90%
the single pin where it should be now. If
I remember rightly it's in the middle x, y

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,460 align:middle line:90%
well I believe should be 0, right on the floor
let's just check that this is going to depend

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,380 align:middle line:90%
on the pivot point of your 3D object. Yep
that's on the floor. Now if you're adventurous

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,310 align:middle line:90%
and you want to have a play with this pin
your second customisation point for this game

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,180 align:middle line:90%
after you've made us a different and much
more interesting lane is to double click on

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,300 align:middle line:90%
your bowling pin if you've got Blender installed,
get into Blender, and to modify this pin and

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,650 align:middle line:84%
to make it your own.

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,080 align:middle line:90%
Now Blender can be a bit of a face full to
get used to and that is exactly why we have

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,449 align:middle line:90%
created this course. You have issues in here
with this interface and how to get a handle

00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,050 align:middle line:90%
on it, I find it really tricky but that's
why we're making a course on it. Anyway try

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,740 align:middle line:90%
and find another bowling pin or modify this
bowling pin if you can at least change the

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,020 align:middle line:90%
colours of these stripes, that is simple to
do, right you just go into the pin render

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,080 align:middle line:90%
material here and you could go to the stripe
material and you could go into here and you

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,789 align:middle line:84%
could change it to let's say a blue stripe.

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:10,210 align:middle line:90%
Alright? So at least customise the colours,
if you really want to get detailed you could

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,400 align:middle line:90%
go into here and you could start putting a
texture onto the pin itself and have a play

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,830 align:middle line:90%
around with all of how that works and the
pin properties. Great opportunity for you

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:25,229 align:middle line:90%
to create and explore and make a mess. OK,
so we have a pin. It lives at 0, 0 and then

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:32,400 align:middle line:90%
1829 was the position of the head pin I believe
from the document. Let's go focus down on

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,130 align:middle line:90%
that pin. OK so the z position is negative
and that's fine, we can have all of our z

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,850 align:middle line:90%
positions in the negative, or, you can switch
your play space around so you need to decide

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,990 align:middle line:90%
now do you want to be dealing with negative
z's or do you want to have positive z's from

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,349 align:middle line:84%
the line that you launch?

00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:56,099 align:middle line:90%
Well I want to be dealing with positives,
so let's move our floor, so firstly I'm going

00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,630 align:middle line:90%
to rename my floor object so it's more clear
what it is, I'm going to move my bowling pin

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,280 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom just for tidiness and now we
need to look at where this floor object is,

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,470 align:middle line:90%
well it's 20m long but it centres in the middle
here. What I actually want to do is move it

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,490 align:middle line:90%
out in the z like that so the line that you
launch your ball from is right at the origin

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:23,030 align:middle line:90%
here. So we need to be minus a thousand centimetres
here and the effect that that has if we put

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,460 align:middle line:90%
a reference cube in - game object / 3D / cube
and then reset that cube, remember that this

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,020 align:middle line:84%
is a one by one centimetre cube.

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,080 align:middle line:90%
Where is it? Well let's take a look - its
right there, it's one hundredth of the width

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,639 align:middle line:90%
of the play space and it's right at the bowling
launch line. Perfect. The other thing that

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,810 align:middle line:90%
we can do with this reference cube of course,
being one centimetre tall is to move it up

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:48,550 align:middle line:90%
one centimetre like that and then to move
it to 1829 in the z direction, so that it's

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,910 align:middle line:90%
sitting right next to the pin. Now it's moved
in positive z, look at this little gizmo at

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,879 align:middle line:90%
the top here, and our playspace disappears
into negative z so you need to be careful

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,349 align:middle line:84%
with your positives and negatives.

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,360 align:middle line:90%
I think that the whole game would be a lot
easier to manage if the playspace, i.e. the

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,490 align:middle line:90%
floor, went not into negative z but into positive
z. So these are the sort of fiddling around

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,919 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to have to do. OK what have
we got now? We've got a bowling pin that shouldn't

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,090 align:middle line:90%
be at 1829 negative but positive, we're just
flipping our entire playspace around. Where's

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,009 align:middle line:90%
the camera? Well, it's kind of in the wrong
place now but that's fine, we can go to the

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,199 align:middle line:90%
end of the playspace, this is a good chance
for you to navigate, or we could either go

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:36,680 align:middle line:90%
to the end of the playspace, spin around,
and then align the camera with the view, or

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,570 align:middle line:84%
we could do this from the inspector.

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,659 align:middle line:90%
We could say that we want the camera to be
at y = 5, that was fine before, it could be

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:50,420 align:middle line:90%
at x = 0, right in the middle of the lane,
and then at z = 0, and then where's the camera?

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,480 align:middle line:90%
Well let's just take a look at it in the scene
view. Do a bit of moving around with the right

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,480 align:middle line:90%
mouse button, click on the camera to visualise
it, there it is. So the problem with it right

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,399 align:middle line:90%
now is its rotation around the y axis. How
do you know that? Well look at these axis

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,649 align:middle line:90%
indicators here, it's the y axis that we need
to spin it around, 180 degrees, there you

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,640 align:middle line:90%
go; and the camera preview looks about right,
and actually it's great, we're looking down

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,120 align:middle line:84%
the lane.

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,040 align:middle line:90%
So now the position of our camera, if we set
it to 0 z, is right at the launch point of

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,649 align:middle line:90%
the lane. We can't see the pins at the end
now, why not? Well because the camera viewport

00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:30,500 align:middle line:90%
is too wide. We need to zoom our camera in
a little bit. Click on the camera again, maybe

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,820 align:middle line:90%
go into game view so that you can see what
you're doing, and just turn the field of view

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,240 align:middle line:90%
of the camera down, OK? And then again you're
going to have to adjust it a little bit until

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920 align:middle line:90%
you can actually see what's going on. So get
used to manipulating these objects, move the

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,279 align:middle line:90%
camera viewpoint up; now what's wrong? Well
the camera has a far point clipping plane

00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,730 align:middle line:90%
of a thousand which is how far it can see.
Why don't we say 2,500? There you go.

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,980 align:middle line:90%
Now it can see out to 25 metres distance,
and you can see that reflected here; you see

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,680 align:middle line:90%
as I move this far point, you see it moving?
So beyond that things aren't rendered for

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,140 align:middle line:84%
this camera, it's like the fog of war.

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,300 align:middle line:90%
So if your camera is sitting now at the start
point, basically at the origin but lifted

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,279 align:middle line:90%
up a little bit by 25 cm off the deck - maybe
we should go higher than that, maybe we should

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:21,399 align:middle line:90%
go 150 cm off the deck, more like a human
height. Sounds like a good idea but it just

00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,930 align:middle line:90%
doesn't look right with this zoomed in camera
so I'm going to put it back down to where

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,790 align:middle line:90%
it was. You see sometimes you just have to
be non-realistic and just play with things.

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,279 align:middle line:90%
Is it right in the middle x-wise? No it could
be, that'll be fine. Probably more boring

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,440 align:middle line:90%
if it is, and we could play with the camera
more later. You get the idea, we want it at

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,910 align:middle line:90%
the origin, looking down the lane, the lane
wants to extend from the origin, i.e. 0,0,0

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,649 align:middle line:90%
all the way down, 20 metres in the positive
z direction as indicated here, the floor is

00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,640 align:middle line:90%
at 0,0,1000 because it's 20 metres long, it
has to be offset by a thousand.

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,700 align:middle line:90%
Where's this reference cube? Its right
down here, actually inside the pin at the

00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:02,050 align:middle line:90%
moment, so lets go to the translate tool
which is up here, and just move it next to

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,720 align:middle line:90%
the pin now it needs to be at y = 1, there
you go, and now you can check and see is this

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,310 align:middle line:90%
guy roughly the right size? Well how big was
the pin supposed to be? Well twenty something

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:20,310 align:middle line:90%
centimetres right? So why not scale your cube
20 cm and move it up 10cm? And that's 20cm

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,450 align:middle line:90%
so you can check against your game design
document how big your pin should be and just

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,730 align:middle line:90%
use physical objects as measuring sticks if
you want.

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,540 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere here we have a pin specification,
here you go. It should be 38 cm tall. So over

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:40,220 align:middle line:90%
in Unity if we set the y scale to 38 half
of that's going to be under the floor, so

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,100 align:middle line:90%
we need to move it up by 15 _4 or half of
38 which is 19 so it sits perfectly on the

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,950 align:middle line:90%
ground, you see right there and you see that
is the height of the pin or thereabouts. So

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,540 align:middle line:90%
great, measuring stick. That's what I used
the cube for. Just to get a handle on what

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,620 align:middle line:90%
this space is. Remember we're choosing for
our units to mean centimetres, they have no

00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,800 align:middle line:84%
meaning until we give them one.

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:07,029 align:middle line:90%
Great, so we have the pin in, let's take you
onto your challenge right now. So I want you

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:13,310 align:middle line:90%
to find your own pin, or modify the pin if
you want to, otherwise use ours from the assets,

00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:18,060 align:middle line:90%
ensure that the dimensions match, or are close
to the GDD, test that the pin sits on the

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:24,510 align:middle line:90%
lane properly like we have there and set up
all ten pins according to the game design

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,600 align:middle line:90%
document that means lay them out and that's
a bit of a hassle but it only needs to be

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,920 align:middle line:90%
done once because we'll prefab the pin set
up. So go ahead, get all that done and I will

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,600 align:middle line:84%
see you in a moment.

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,839 align:middle line:90%
Cool welcome back, so now it's just a question
of firstly I just need to make sure that the

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,850 align:middle line:90%
pin actually collides with the floor, so that
it will let me play the game here, and the

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:52,399 align:middle line:90%
pin well, it probably does collide with the
floor but there's no gravity on it yet. We'll

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,459 align:middle line:90%
deal with the physics of the pin in a little
bit but for now all I needed you to do was

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,839 align:middle line:90%
to make sure that they sit on the floor graphically.
If you've been a little more advanced and

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,540 align:middle line:90%
already added a rigidbdy to the pin and noticed
that it falls to the floor then extra bonus,

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,670 align:middle line:90%
but let's cover the physics of the pin in
a separate video.

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:15,570 align:middle line:90%
Cool, so for now we need to just replicate
these pins in such a way that they match the

00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,950 align:middle line:90%
game design document for the pin layout. So
that's at the beginning of this section, you

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:28,550 align:middle line:90%
have this document here and we have a 30.48cm
spacing between them sideways and a 52.71

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,880 align:middle line:90%
spacing this way. That's a bit weird. So how
are we going to do that? Well I like to have

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:41,399 align:middle line:90%
an empty parent object called pins, and it's
good practice to pop that at the origin. Or,

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,470 align:middle line:90%
to pop it at the position of the head pin
actually, which is what I'm going to do. 1829

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,449 align:middle line:84%
so it's here, the game object is there.

00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:54,980 align:middle line:90%
Then when I move the bowling pin into it,
it's offset the head pin is not offset at

00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,279 align:middle line:90%
all from the pins object so the pins object
is relative to that headpin. Now it's just

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,380 align:middle line:90%
a question of duplicating the pin, and actually
what would be useful because it's going to

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,110 align:middle line:90%
auto-number the pins for you is why not delete
that first one and just duplicate like this

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:16,550 align:middle line:90%
- 2, and then bring it back put it roughly
in place, duplicate splodge d, 3, again command

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,850 align:middle line:90%
or control d, you see the idea here and we
can just duplicate these pins out moving them

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,279 align:middle line:90%
into roughly the right position I suggest
is a good idea. Careful about using this box

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,949 align:middle line:90%
translator as it'll move it in 3 dimensions
and that will be confusing. So it's probably

00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,230 align:middle line:90%
easier just to use your red and your blue
handles; and also remember that you can move

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,060 align:middle line:90%
your viewpoint, don't fight in a 3D view if
you don't need to be; and now you could actually

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:44,040 align:middle line:90%
label these exactly as they should be so if
this is pin 1, 2 and 3 as we look from above,

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,740 align:middle line:90%
why not spin it around, get above it and then
make sure we're doing pin 1, 2 you see two

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,100 align:middle line:90%
and three are round the wrong way as such
so let's just get them right.

00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:03,810 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, and then 4, 5 is inside four at the
moment because of the way that I duplicated

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:11,079 align:middle line:90%
it, we're just going to do a rough layout
to start with, then six and the beauty of

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,310 align:middle line:90%
duplicating these after deleting the first
pin is that they auto-number, isn't that easy.

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:21,870 align:middle line:90%
Seven, eight and I suggest immediately that
you duplicate them that you move the new object

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,040 align:middle line:90%
out so it doesn't end up too confused, and
there you go we have a set of pins. Now they're

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,630 align:middle line:90%
not lined up perfectly, and that's not surprising
because we havent yet actually inspected

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,009 align:middle line:84%
them to line them up perfectly.

00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,560 align:middle line:90%
So how are we going to do that? How are we
going to make sure that the pins are in exactly

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,389 align:middle line:90%
the right positions? Well you just need to
go through and do a little bit of calculation,

00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:44,959 align:middle line:90%
so if it's - looking at this vertical dimension
looking from pin 3 to 9 that's going to be

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,029 align:middle line:90%
the same as the dimension from pin 1 to 5
so let's start there with number one; and

00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:56,690 align:middle line:90%
we need to make sure that the dimension 9
to 3 or 3 to 9 is 52.71 cm, let's remember

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:04,070 align:middle line:90%
52.71 so we need pin 5 to be 52.71 cm back
from pin 0.

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,970 align:middle line:90%
So pin 0 is at 0, 0, 0 relative to the pin
array, which is a nice, that's the head pin

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:15,899 align:middle line:90%
so that makes sense. Pin 5 we want to be at
x = 0, y = 0 because we want it sitting on

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:22,990 align:middle line:90%
the floor but 52.71 back. Now to me that looks
like that's too far back but no but it's OK,

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,430 align:middle line:90%
it's just a bigger gap than we expect. This
pin has ended up all the way back here. That

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,220 align:middle line:90%
seems like it's a long way back to me, in
fact that is too long a way back for sure.

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:39,199 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take a look where pin 2 would be,
that would put pin 2 maybe it is OK?

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,690 align:middle line:90%
Pin 2 there, pin 3 here, yeah maybe that's
fine. So pin 4 would come down here, see a

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:51,170 align:middle line:90%
messy business of just laying out the pins
roughly right in the first place and then

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,209 align:middle line:90%
we just have to move the back layer of pins
all the way back and you could actually multi-select

00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:01,610 align:middle line:90%
those to do that by holding down command.
OK, so maybe they are that spaced out. It

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,870 align:middle line:90%
feels a little bit odd, looks a little bit
odd, but let's make sure that it works. Pin

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:12,990 align:middle line:90%
1 is at 0, 0, 0, pin 5 is the first one that
we have a handle on is at 0,0,52.71. That's

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,199 align:middle line:84%
what it says, let's just keep going then.

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,730 align:middle line:90%
So we have 30.48cm sideways between two pins.
So that means we have 15.24cm is half of that,

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:29,240 align:middle line:90%
right? So that's where this guy needs to be,
pin 2 needs to be at -15.24 going half the

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,720 align:middle line:90%
distance sideways and then how far back? Well
half of 52.71 now we're stretching my mental

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,200 align:middle line:90%
calculations a little bit so let's just use
a calculator. 26.355 you may as well copy

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,370 align:middle line:90%
that from your calculator to be precise, and
just pop it in here. There you go. So it's

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:53,220 align:middle line:90%
pretty obvious now what pin number 3 is going
to be, it's going to be the same type of thing

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,990 align:middle line:90%
as number 2 but with the opposite x co-ordinate
so 15.24.

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:03,160 align:middle line:90%
OK look, now I'm not going to bore you by
going through and showing you the final layout

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:09,330 align:middle line:90%
of these pins so I'm just going to cut to
the end result where I've applied the same

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:14,809 align:middle line:90%
calculation to make sure that all these pins
are in the perfect positions. So a couple

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:21,669 align:middle line:90%
more tips to help you with this, I've laid
out most of my pins I just want to show you

00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:27,830 align:middle line:90%
two more options, one is don't be afraid to
delete pins if you find that it's going to

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,660 align:middle line:90%
be easier just to duplicate like that perhaps
and then move this guy across maybe to 15.2,

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,370 align:middle line:84%
that's one option for you.

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:42,220 align:middle line:90%
The other thing that you can do if you have
a rough set pin like this pin number ten here,

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:48,049 align:middle line:90%
let's imagine that it's in a weird position
like so, and you say well it's pretty much

00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:53,870 align:middle line:90%
the same position as this guy, he's just the
opposite x component, what you could do is

00:18:53,870 --> 00:19:00,039 align:middle line:90%
go to the transform of say pin 7 or whichever
one, copy the component, that copies the whole

00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:05,490 align:middle line:90%
transform component, click on the destination
pin and paste component values and it will

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,179 align:middle line:90%
snap right on the top of this guy and then
if you remove the negative then that's another

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,130 align:middle line:84%
way of doing it.

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,289 align:middle line:90%
Now if you still think that this looks weird
then you can change your camera from perspective

00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:19,100 align:middle line:90%
to isometric. Now perspective is obviously
how we see the world, isometric is like a

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,360 align:middle line:90%
camera at infinity and now there is no perspective,
and actually from this point of view it's

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,880 align:middle line:90%
all looking a lot more sensible in the perspective
view and maybe down here they look too spread

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,340 align:middle line:90%
out but we're just so used to seeing bins
from down here that it just doesn't match

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,590 align:middle line:90%
our intuition. It looks a lot better down
here right? Again isometric here looks weird

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,270 align:middle line:90%
but perspective here looks right, and isometric
from above looks right as well.

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,780 align:middle line:90%
So congratulations! All our pins are laid
out beautifully in the play space and if we

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,030 align:middle line:90%
look at our game camera you can see something
looking like a bowling lane and we have a

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:57,030 align:middle line:90%
master game object so perfect! Well done looking
