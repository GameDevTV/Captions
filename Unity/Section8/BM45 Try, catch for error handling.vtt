00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.860
Hey hey, so in this video we're gonna talk about
try catch for error handling we'll

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.639
be talking about how to decouple our
code with the try catch method mainly

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.470
used for file handling applications but
it could be used in a team so that one

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.720
person could move on perhaps accepting
that the other person has to stay behind

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.420
and get the bugs fixed and we're going to be
isolating our score display issues and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.029
then making sure that our game fails
gracefully. So let me show you what this

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.230
try catch thing's all about let's go to our
game manager which is where our

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.460
problem is. Remember from pin counter it's
really important that game manager dot bowl

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.640
finishes execution so that the pin counter
can continue through when it does

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.180
actually call game manager dot bowl. So I'm
gonna show you how try catch works, what

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.329
we do is we go try and then open curly
braces we have a code block so I'll indent

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.350
this lot which I'm doing with command or
control and right bracket;  OK so I indent

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.720
my code and then I come back out
again so I'm gonna try that lot but if

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.729
it doesn't work I'm gonna catch the
error in another code block, and in this case I'm

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.100
simply gonna go debug dot log warning
and then it's not going to, by the way this

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.930
isn't gonna stop the problem happening,
you're gonna do that, but I'm just

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.009
showing you how to do it.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:37.119
Debug log warning something went wrong in
game manager, or just in bowl will do, cause you'll

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.740
be able to see from the error log where it's
happening so that's how do the try

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.560
catch it tries to do these things, if
they succeed great just carries on out

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.390
to here, if they don't succeed then it
will log a warning and carry on

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.869
crucially so what I want you to do now
is to put a very similar try catch loop

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.310
around the score display line, the
offending line, that's your job now so

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.460
that the game runs so use the same try
catch pattern; protect score display dot

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.159
fill roll card bowls with it and then check
that your game now runs without any

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.990
warnings. Go on then.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.520
You're doing it, right? Fantastic so here we go
let's just do the same thing so try and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.580
fill the role card but if you get in
trouble then catch the problem and debug

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:39.770
log out a warning, while
fill roll card failed, or errored. ok so

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.420
let's look at  that. Now whatever happens when
pin counter calls into bowl it's going

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.400
to... even if there's an error in one of
these three lines it'll make it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.740
to here, and then if there's an error in
this line then it'll still get through. So the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.600
execution should continue now, let's go
have a look in unity; see what happens

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:08.130
we bowl, it counts four standing pins, the ball
resets, it tells us that the Fill Roll

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.840
Card failed, of course it failed, we've
contrived this whole thing so that it

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.000
fails but look, the game continues and it's
doing the right thing, there it did a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.150
tidy and if I bowl down the middle

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.350
it'll do an end turn... and life's all good again. So is it ok
to polyfill over an error like this? Well

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.050
carefully, yes here's a guideline: do not
polyfill over an error you don't

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.260
understand. So I specifically made sure
we wrote down the trace and understood

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.140
what's going on here before we poly
filled over it OK? You never never try catch

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.090
yourself out of a problem that you don't
understand so the second thing to

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.960
say is it's ok if you know what you're
doing, so you could just paste over it

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.900
like this because this may be a one in a
thousand times error and it may make a lot

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.800
of sense to protect a crucial execution
loop like that and it might be that what

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.650
this actually does when it catches this
error is rather than just logging maybe

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.930
it actually puts something in a log file
or even sends back to your server saying

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.670
wow this weird things happened what's
going on and sends a bug report, you

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.959
know those automated bug reports you
get? They've probably come out of

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.290
something like this and maybe the player
can carry on you know maybe it's only

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.310
in one in a thousand games of bowling that this this error occurred,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.520
depending on how you've written this
method and maybe the player could just

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.660
carry on and go that's weird I've got a
strange score this time but it doesn't

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.520
happen for them again so this is a case
of failing gracefully, this is setting

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.360
your code up to fail gracefully. Of
course somebody needs to - preferably you -

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.220
follow right behind you and fix this
code which is exactly what needs to

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.160
happen next.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.650
What we need to do is think about how to
actually make fill roll card work

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.400
properly but that's a subject of another
video so for now congratulations you

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.090
have a new tool in your armoury, the try
catch structure. Do look up try catch

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.200
C# and have a look on the web,
there are some more terms you can use

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.080
here, some more things you can do with it,
and I look forward to seeing you soon.
