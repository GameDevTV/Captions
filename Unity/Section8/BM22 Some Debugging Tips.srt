00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys and girls. welcome back!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So. we have some bugs! So. in this video we're going to learn a bit

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
more about Transform.Translate(). use the

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Step Button to slow things down. talk about the perils

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of moving Static Colliders. how

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
default animation blends can cause issues. and

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
also warning you about moving motion clips around. which

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is another thing that caused our bug. So. let's take a look at these things.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
one at a time. and see where our problems

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
have been caused. Let's start by reminding ourselves

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
what the problem is. The problem is that. when you click Tidy

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in the game

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
state here. you see the way the pins disappear? Let's get

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the pins up. on the left hand side here. So you

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
play the game. hit the Tidy trigger. and a

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
bunch of pins disappear. If we go down and look at the Scene View.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you've only got two or three pins left. And

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
what's going on? So. firstly my pins

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
are not lifting. so let's deal with that element first. If you go to

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
your PinSetter Script

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and take a look at the

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
"(Raising pins") method. I have said transform.Translate

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and then I put in a Vector3. but let's look at the

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
docs for Transform.Translate. just for a moment.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You'll notice something in the docs. the Transform

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
.Translate. which is this.

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
"If relativeTo is left out or

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
set to Space.Self the

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
movement is applied relative to the transform's local axes."

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So. this thing here is defaulting to

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a transform. relative to the local axes

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of the pin. rather than

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the global axes of the game. And we want to move this thing

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
up. in the global Y space. so we need to just

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
add in a comma space dot world.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So. let's just do that. On the end of your translate

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
function. you can put in .Space.World);

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And that should make it reliably move up. in the global

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Y direction. in the game's general Y direction. Let's just

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
take a look at that first bit. and make sure that over in this

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Scene View. the pins rise up. They do! You can see that they are

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
raised up there. in the very beginning. Let's just check it again.

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Click play. the pins do raise

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
up. OK. sure they fall down again. but we'll deal with all that

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in a moment. So. that was the lesson about

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the Transform.Translate. but I still want to know why these pins

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
are disappearing. so here's another trick for you. Let's

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
go to the Animator. turn off your trigger for a sec. play the game.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
go and have a look down at the

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
end. and then. pause the game.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You can set your trigger off. even in Pause Mode.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and I'm going to look at my PinSetter here.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Do you remember the Pin Setter Box over here? It has a Box Collider

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
on it. the Pin Setter. So. let's

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
start stepping through and see what happens.

56
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now. if for some

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
reason your Box Collider is not showing. mine is off in the Gizmos

58
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
for some reason. you're welcome to turn it back on. I'd like you to

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
be able to see your Box Collider. I'm not sure how my ended up off.

60
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So. as I step through frame by frame here. watch what happens! Ahh.

61
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
those back pins disappear out the end of the Box Collider.

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and then they get destroyed by that OnTrigger

63
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Exit Script. So. this

64
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
moving step by step is incredibly useful for spotting that

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
sort of thing. Now. of course there are two issues here. One is

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
why is the whole Box Collider moving? And the other

67
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
is. why are the pins being destroyed. when it goes out the back?

68
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Well. they're being destroyed. when it goes out the back. simply

69
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
because the code tells them to be destroyed. If you look at your

70
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
PinSetter code. you have an OnTriggerExit.

71
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and it says if a pin leaves the collider.

72
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
then destroy it. Also. we shouldn't really be

73
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
moving this collider. because it is a Static Collider.

74
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
If you'll remember back to your Collider Interaction Matrix.

75
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
it's just a Static Collider. because it has no Rigidbody on it.

76
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We don't want to be moving those. So.

77
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
why are we moving them? Well. we're moving it because

78
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
when we took our motion. that was attached to the Swiper

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and renamed it PinSetter. it was a

80
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
motion that was just effecting the transform. Remember the

81
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
motion here is just effecting the transform of the thing

82
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
it was attached to. It used to be attached to the PinSetter. it's now

83
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
up to the Swiper rather. it's now attached to the PinSetter. so it's

84
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
moving the entire PinSetter. Now. because the Swiper

85
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
is a child object of the PinSetter. they are all moving together

86
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in that same animation sequence. Let's watch them do it. You see that.

87
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So. that'a a bit weird right? And that's

88
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
a little bit weird that that's doing that. and that's what's causing the bug.

89
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So. a warning about moving animation clips

90
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
around. How do we fix it? Well. good question!

91
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
There's two ways you could fix it. You could either remake your animation. which is what

92
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I'm going to suggest. because it's going to produce the most fundamental solution.

93
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
The problem here is that we're animating now the wrong

94
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
thing; we're animating the whole PinSetter. rather than just the Swiper

95
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
inside it. so I'm going to suggest doing that. There are other

96
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
ways around this. Of course. you could on this Animator

97
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
here. say to the Box Collider. you could turn it off

98
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
but that's just adding complexity. Turning the Box

99
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Collider off. at the start of the animation. and then.

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
turning it on again is a bit nasty. it's

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
adding complexity to try and solve the problem. Whenever you're doing

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that. you're making things worse. really. So. if you can

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
bite the bullet and redo this animation. which I'll do in a moment. then that's

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
always going to be a better way of doing things. But I want to show you one

105
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
more potential problem with this as well. which also makes it quite hard to

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
debug. Watch this! If you look at the transition

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
in the tidy substate.

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
from Raise to Swipe. you'll notice that by default over here

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in the Inspector it has a blend.

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
What that means is that. it... Oh. let me just try

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and get it back on the screen. There we go! It has this blend. it

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
spends a little bit of time both in Raise and Swipe.

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and of course. it doesn't trigger that piece of code

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to raise the pins. until very near the

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
end of the Raise motion.

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And have a look at the Raise motion. where it is at the end of it. it

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is just a call to a piece of script. So.

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
let's watch what happens step by step again.

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
when we trigger. So. let's to through...

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I have to start again.

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So. start with your trigger off. pause the game.

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
look at the scene. maybe get the

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
PinSetter on the screen. play the game.

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and then. we've already done the trigger. so I'm going to go to the top

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
level. Step

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
through the Idle state. until... I'll just redo

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the trigger. just in case I forgot it. Step through the Idle state

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
until it's finished. Here you go! So we're going through Raise now.

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Raise raise. Now look. you see the Swipe

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
motion. you see this blue line going down the

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
transition here. It's saying there's a blend in progress. and

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
even before the Raise has finished or even

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
triggered. look the thing is moving! The box is moving.

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
so we delete the back pins.

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Then. we're raising up and then because gravity is

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
on. the pins fall down. So. hopefully you can

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
understand all of those different things. interactions. that are going

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
on there. So. we'll fix it in just a moment. but I just want to put the

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
problem back on the screen for you. so you can understand.

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So. we decided to use Transform.Translate() and that's fine!

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Of course. you could have said Transform.position +=

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
in a vector. That would have worked fine. If you are going to use

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Transform.Translate() be aware of that last parameter. and make your

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
decision about whether you're moving in world space or relative to the

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
object. Number two. using the Step button to

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
slow things down. Incredibly helpful. you can do it at any time.

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
You can pause the game and go through one frame at a time. really handy.

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Number three. the perils of moving those

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Static Colliders. So. we don't want to move a Static Collider.

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Unity doesn't expect Static Colliders like that

151
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
PinSetter Box to be moving. so don't move them.

152
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Number four. how default animation blends can cause issues.

153
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So. if you were wondering why

154
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
the Swipe motion was starting to

155
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
happen. before even the Raise happened. that's because

156
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
of the blend. the Animation State Blend. And by default you'll have

157
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
those blends in there. to try and make animations smooth. but if

158
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
you're calling functions from script and you have a blend in

159
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
place. it can cause problems. And be careful

160
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
about moving your motion clips around. because otherwise. you're going to have to do what we

161
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
ought to do now. which is just redo this animation.

162
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The animation. in my case. wasn't great anyway. I'm very sorry if you spend a

163
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
lot of time on your animation. I want to use this as

164
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
a warning to you about the difficulty. actually. of copying an animation.

165
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because I don't know a way of getting this animation

166
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
in here. from the Swipe motion

167
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
of the pin. I don't know how to get these keyframes.

168
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and I have had a good look. there are some tools that'll do it.

169
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
But I don't know any standard way in Unity of taking all these keyframes and applying

170
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
them to what we need it to be applied to now.

171
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
which is the Swiper's transform. of course .position.

172
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
That's the thing that we need to be adding to this. We need to

173
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
dig in and add very similar keyframes to the Swiper.

174
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So. you can do it just by inspection. of course. but you're

175
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
not going to easily be able to do it by copying

176
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and pasting. even in the curves. Some people seem to have had some luck;

177
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I can't make it work reliably enough to teach it. So. what I'm

178
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
going to do is. I'm just going to delete all of the properties that

179
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
move the PinSetter's position and just leave

180
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the sub-object. Swiper. and just reanimate. I'm just going to delete

181
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
all the keyframes and just reanimate. There's not a huge amount of value

182
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
in there. in my case. So. what I'm going to

183
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
do is just go in. in the Recording Mode of the Animator.

184
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
you're hopefully getting quite used to now. and I am

185
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
going to start putting my keyframes in. So. my first keyframe is going

186
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
to be at say half a second. something like that.

187
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Remember. you can zoom in by holding down Alt and

188
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
rolling the mouse wheel.

189
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So. it's something like. this time I'm going to put in a keyframe.

190
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and just go ahead now. really quickly. and rebuild that animation.

191
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So obviously. I've sped up the video

192
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
again here. I'm going to make more and more use of that technique. as we go

193
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
through the course. so that we can get some leverage on

194
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
your time. when it's repetitive things like this.

195
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So. we're just going ahead and reproducing a very similar

196
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
animation. to before. by moving the object

197
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
around in this Record Mode of the Animator.

198
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and then placing our keyframes and their positions.

199
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
as we go. And then. I'm making sure

200
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that the Swiper comes back. I'm using the Inspector

201
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
occasionally. to look at the Z position of

202
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the Swiper. so that we return to the same

203
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
horizontal position. before moving up vertically.

204
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And then finally. to smooth out

205
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
the motion. I'm going to be taking a look at the curves.

206
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
so that the Swiper doesn't go through the floor. So. by

207
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
holding down Alt and scrolling around or double clicking.

208
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
if you're not sure. you should get to the curves. Look for your

209
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Y curve. and you can get a really nice motion.

210
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
OK welcome back! So. we've got a pretty cool looking

211
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Swipe motion. going on there now. which is fantastic! And

212
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
we're back to where we want to be. with the simplest possible solution.

213
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
which was redoing the PinSetter's

214
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
animation motion. for the

215
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Swipe motion and we're digging into the

216
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
swiper. OK fantastic! So.

217
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that's working nicely now. Now. what we need to do. or what

218
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
you need to do is just get these Raise and Lower pins methods finished off.

219
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So. it's going to be a challenge for you now. Let's go ahead and do that!

220
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Refactor Raise and LowerPins(). Enter Pin.cs.

221
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
We don't really want it in the PinSetter. there's enough stuff in the PinSetter.

222
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Now. let's move some of the responsibility over to the

223
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
pin itself. So. move RaisePins()

224
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and LoverPins() into Pin.cs. Rename them Raise() and Lower(). because

225
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the context now tells you what they do.

226
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Create a distToRaise. at the top of the Pin.cs

227
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
class. which is going to be a property that tells us how

228
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
high we need to raise them. It will depend on the height of the pins mainly.

229
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And disable and re-enable

230
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
gravity as necessary. during the animation sequence.

231
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
so that the pins don't fall. And just test that the whole lot works

232
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
together. properly for me. So go ahead. pause the video! See if you can get

233
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
all this. Tidy and Reset. finished off and working

234
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
properly. now that we've solved the bugs.

235
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
OK great! Fantastic!

236
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Welcome back! So. let's go ahead and do this refactoring. It's always a good

237
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
thing to be refactoring. when you think that you need to.

238
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So. I'm going from Pinsetter to Pin. so I may as well rearrange

239
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
my tabs at the top. so I know what I'm doing.

240
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And just take a look. So. where have we got

241
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
RaisePins and LowerPins here?

242
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Well. we already have a RaisePins and LowerPins

243
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in PinSetter. Now. you're going to need to leave the RaisePins

244
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and LowePins methods there. of course. because otherwise the

245
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Animator will not be able to make the calls to them

246
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
because an Animator can only call scripts that are on the object

247
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
or sub objects. But we're just going to make them a very thin

248
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
pass through. So. rather than saying

249
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
if the pin is standing. do all this.

250
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
we'll take that responsibility and put it

251
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
over in the pin here. So.

252
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
over in the pin. let's go to the bottom and pop that code in

253
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and then. wrap it in a public...

254
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Yes it does need to be public; public Raise ()

255
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and it's void. it doesn't send anything back. Public

256
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
void Raise () and then.

257
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
we need to just change that code up a little bit. so it's no longer if (pin.

258
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
IsStanding(). because we are in the context now of the pin.

259
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
so it's just (IsStanding(). Again. we don't need the pin

260
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
.transform.Translate. distanceToRaise...

261
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
...distToRaise. Just stick

262
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
with my example. and then. at the top of the method

263
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
we are going to go public float

264
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
distToRaise = I'm going to give it a default of 40 centimeters.

265
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It's about right for this size of pin.

266
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So. if it's standing raise it. that's fine!

267
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
That's done right! If it's standing raise it. that's simple.

268
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And let's have another method. which is public

269
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Lower () and is void. I keep forgetting the

270
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
return types tonight. So fantastic! There you

271
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
go! So. we're just going to lower them. regardless.

272
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
We're just going to transform.Translate it downwards. in world

273
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
space. by minus the distance. which

274
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
is why I'm using a variable because we can change the same thing in two places.

275
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Great! So. we also said that we

276
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
wanted to turn the gravity

277
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
off of all of the pins. in question. So.

278
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
let's not do that here. because we...

279
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Do we have access to the Rigidbody? Yes. we do! OK.

280
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
because we already have access to the Rigidbody and the pin. let's go ahead

281
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and do that. So. it's going to simply a case of going say. rigidBody

282
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
.gravity or use gravity

283
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
= false; So. we turn gravity

284
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
off and raise it up. and then. when we lower it down. we put gravity back

285
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
on at the end. So. we put it down on the floor and turn gravity back

286
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
on. And that's how we stop the pins from falling.

287
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Cool! So.

288
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
there's my code

289
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
for the raise and lower. inside the pins. and then. all I need to do

290
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
over in the PinSetter. when I raise. I say for each

291
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
pin just pin.Raise();

292
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Just showing you how you can move

293
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
code around all you like and just change the API.

294
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and don't be afraid to refactor and do this. So. pin

295
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
.lower. Oops. small p. Ah.

296
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
OK. so with LowerPins of course. I've got to do the same thing. roughly the same

297
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
same thing. I just need to

298
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
iterate through like this. and pin.Lower ();

299
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
So. one other thing is. it's not just raising them. it's raising

300
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
them if standing.

301
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So. I'm actually going to change my suggestion from the challenge. having

302
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
done it. and just make this method on Pin.cs. Raise if

303
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Standing (). because that's what it actually does.

304
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
OK. let's try all this and see how we get on.

305
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So. the main thing to be concerned about is. what happens

306
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
when we click the Tidy trigger? Does it work?

307
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Hmm. sort of. the Raise isn't happening.

308
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Now. that's probably just because we've been playing around

309
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
with the names of our methods and it's disconnected.

310
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Raise and lets just check Lower. while

311
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
we're here. LowerPins().

312
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
OK. so I'm a bit concerned that

313
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
this thing is called Raise. Go back to your code. make sure...

314
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Ah OK! RaisePins ()

315
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
OK. just get your name in right. Now. when you change your

316
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
method name. back in the Animator. you probably

317
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
find you're going to need to reconnect that.

318
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Yep you are. OK fantastic!

319
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So hopefully now. with any luck when we're looking

320
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
down at the end and we go through our various animation

321
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
triggers it'll work. Tidy trigger! Raises!

322
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
The animation happens like that. the Swipe happens all the way to the back

323
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and it drops them down. Beautiful! Let's try the Reset! We

324
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
are not raising in the Reset. What's happening

325
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
there? Well. you're not supposed to Raise

326
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
it in the Reset. That's absolutely fine! Yeah. the Reset is

327
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
not yet instantiating new pins. but that will be for another video.

328
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
All I want to do to finish this one off is to bowl the ball down

329
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and have a few standing pins. before I Tidy.

330
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And then. I am done for this video. and we'll talk about instantiating

331
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
new pins and what else we need to do.

332
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
in terms of tidying up in the next video. So. let's just check

333
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
that the Tidy actually really works properly now.

334
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
[Ball Sound Effect in Background]

335
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Here it comes! So. the pin counting

336
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
is working. that's fantastic! Let's hit Tidy! Oh. it's

337
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
gone to the Start. That's absolutely fine! And let's hit Tidy now.

338
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
That's great. because we've actually got a couple of pins

339
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
to swipe out of the way. at least one. Lift up.

340
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
swipe the remaining pin. it comes back. and

341
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
drops them down. Look at that! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!

342
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
So. that's good enough for this video. You've done really well.

343
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and we will polish off all of this

344
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and do a little bit of code refactoring. in the next video.

345
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
before moving on to different things like physics. And then

346
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Eventually. we'll swing all the way around to the scoring system. So. good progress

347
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.800
and we'll see you soon!
