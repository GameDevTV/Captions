00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.090 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back. it is time to install Unity
5. We're going to talk about how to keep Unity

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.780 align:middle line:90%
4.6.3 on your machine as well as Unity 5.
we'll be installing the latest version of

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Unity 5 and then taking a quick tour of what
is different. So the first thing to understand

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.329 align:middle line:90%
is that on your machine right now you'll probably
find if you go to your applications that you

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:90%
have a single folder called Unity. and what
we want to end up with is two folders - one

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:90%
called Unity 4.6 and one called Unity 5 to
be explicit.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.420 align:middle line:90%
So the first thing you need to do is find
your Unity folder and just rename it from

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.649 align:middle line:90%
Unity to Unity 4.6 so just go ahead and do
that now. rename your Unity folder in your

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:90%
applications to Unity 4.6. OK by the way.
in the future Unity may change the way that

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Unity 5 installs so that you can choose whether
you overwrite or upgrade but this is a surefire

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.409 align:middle line:90%
way of making sure that you keep Unity 4.6
if you want to - you don't have to because

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:90%
we can upgrade all of the previous projects
to Unity 5 but if you want to keep 4.6 this

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.389 align:middle line:84%
is how you do it.

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:90%
OK so the next thing is to install the latest
version of Unity 5. how do we do that? Well.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.729 align:middle line:90%
go Unity3D.com. click on Get Unity and it
will bring you to a page that looks like this.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:90%
or similar to a page like this it may change.
and you are looking for a personal edition

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.789 align:middle line:90%
of Unity 5. go for the free download and you'll
notice that when you click download what it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:90%
will install is not actually Unity 5. it's
a download assistant for Unity 5. so it's

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.869 align:middle line:90%
a new way of deploying Unity 5 so when you
open that download assistant and run it you'll

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.509 align:middle line:90%
get the standard warnings on your platform.
and then you'll get to the point where it

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.530 align:middle line:90%
starts to ask you about licence agreements
which of course you'll read every word of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and then carefully agree.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Comme ça. and then here you go. It's going
to ask you about components. do you need all

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.649 align:middle line:90%
these things? Just leave it like that if I
were you. Unity 5. the web player and the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.909 align:middle line:90%
standard assets. they're all useful. I would
argue that the example project is not particularly

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:90%
useful. but if you do want to look around
it and you've got plenty of time and broadband

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:90%
capacity then go ahead. Then you get to chose
your destination etc. Now I'm not going to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:90%
go through the installation here because that's
boring and at this stage in the course I'm

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:90%
pretty sure that you can install a software
package.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.349 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to back out of this installation
altogether and just show you what a finished

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.459 align:middle line:90%
Unity 5 looks like so here we go. When you
open Unity 5 you'll have a new screen looking

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:90%
something like this although of course this
has got some projects in it. This is very

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:90%
very different from how Unity 4's opening
screen looks. so at this point you want to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:90%
create yourself a new project and I would
be calling it BowlMaster because that's the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:90%
title of this section. Alright? I'm going
to store this somewhere temporary because

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I already have that repository set up.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:90%
But choose a folder where you already know
where it is and if you're using version control

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.049 align:middle line:90%
like Github or anything like that then put
it in there. OK cool so you wait a moment

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:90%
and up springs Unity 5 now it immediately
seems different. it mainly seems different

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:90%
to be honest because by default this little
button here has the Skybox and fog and flares

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.239 align:middle line:90%
turned on. If you notice when I turn those
off we're back to something that looks pretty

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:90%
much identical to Unity 4.6.3. in fact the
only two ways that I think that you can easily

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.049 align:middle line:90%
tell that you're in here is number one you
could go to Unity and about Unity and it would

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.459 align:middle line:90%
tell you that you are using version 5. and
number two. you can see in brackets it tells

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:90%
you a licence edition in Unity five here.
it says personal.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.019 align:middle line:90%
There are several other little tell-tale signs
such as if you click game you'll see that

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.629 align:middle line:90%
you have a mute audio option. so there are
a few differences. Now for more differences

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.709 align:middle line:90%
you can click on our blog post. let me show
you the slide. At the bottom here you can

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:90%
go to completeunitydeveloper.com you can just
search our blog for differences or click in

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.989 align:middle line:90%
this very .pdf and you will see this blog
post here which will show you all of the differences.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:90%
all of at least the superficial differences
between the two versions in some detail.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.549 align:middle line:90%
So that's it. your challenge now is simply
to get Unity 5 installed and working. ensure

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:90%
that you can open it. take a look around and
then create yourself a new project called

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:90%
BowlMaster and that will be the end of the
video because I have already shown you basically

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:90%
how to do all of that. So good luck with that.
and see you soon.
