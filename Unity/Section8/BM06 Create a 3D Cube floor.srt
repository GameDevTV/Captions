
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:07,990 align:middle line:90%
Hi, welcome back and I'm really looking forward
to getting into this bowling game with you

00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,730 align:middle line:90%
guys. So we're going to get used to 3D controls,
create a bowling lane floor according to the

00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,730 align:middle line:90%
Game Design Document, and set your main camera
to look down the lane. So firstly go find

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,230 align:middle line:90%
your game design document, it's actually at
the start of your section notes; it's also

00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,300 align:middle line:90%
in a separate .pdf at the beginning of the
section, and in there you'll find the bowling

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,279 align:middle line:90%
lane specification. We're going to use centimetres
as our unit of choice here because it just

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,290 align:middle line:90%
fits really well with this game, it's a centimetre
scale game.

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,080 align:middle line:90%
Metres are simply too big, and millimetres
are simply too small. So if we check the specs

00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,860 align:middle line:90%
from the Wikipedia article linked at the bottom
we'll find that it's 18.29 metres or 1829

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,480 align:middle line:90%
centimetres from the foul line, i.e. the line
that you're not allowed to cross when bowling

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,440 align:middle line:90%
to the front pin, the head pin. So we're going
to make it 2 metres, which is 2000 centimetres

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,080 align:middle line:90%
long, a hundred and five centimetres wide,
I'm actually going to make it a cuboid and

00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,860 align:middle line:90%
give it some height, so we're representing
a physical floor that of course must have

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,110 align:middle line:90%
some depth, that's going to help with collisions,
things like that.

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,510 align:middle line:90%
OK so let's dive over into Unity 5 and take
a look at this game. So here you've got a

00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,310 align:middle line:90%
brand new Unity project, all I've done is
created myself a scene here called game, OK

00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,690 align:middle line:90%
so I've simply gone save scene /game I think
that you get the idea by this stage in the

00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,490 align:middle line:90%
course. So create yourself a game object - game
object / 3D object / Cube. Go ahead and do

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,280 align:middle line:90%
that now, let's put a simple cube in the scene
and if you want to focus on it double click

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,520 align:middle line:84%
on it in the hierarchy.

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,560 align:middle line:90%
Now talking about the hierarchy you'll notice
that there's one other difference in Unity

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,840 align:middle line:90%
5 and that's that you'll always get a directional
light right off the cuff, that just comes

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,130 align:middle line:90%
in there that's fine, and your main camera
gizmo here's rather large, if you find that

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,620 align:middle line:90%
annoying like I do click on gizmos in the
scene view and then drag down on the top on

00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:54,520 align:middle line:90%
your 3D gizmos slider to make your camera
gizmo much smaller. You can also click here

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,200 align:middle line:90%
at the top of scene view if you can see where
my mouse is and that will give you the option

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,260 align:middle line:84%
to turn off that skybox in the background.

00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,270 align:middle line:90%
I think that I'm going to leave it on just
so that we make it very clear at a glance

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,159 align:middle line:90%
that we're in Unity 5 but that's called a
Skybox and we'll be dealing with that later

00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,260 align:middle line:90%
when we change it to a nice starfield and
make it a nice space bowling game. So there

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,590 align:middle line:90%
we have a cube. Now you need to know how we
navigate around in the 3D world. So how do

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,870 align:middle line:90%
you do that? Well, I suggest using a 3 button
mouse if you possibly can; if you haven't

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,200 align:middle line:90%
got a 3 button mouse then just click here
with a Q key or at the top left on the little

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,380 align:middle line:90%
hand icon and you can also use a tracking
pad. 2 fingers forward and back or zoom on

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,090 align:middle line:90%
the trackpad does the same as a mouse wheel,
goes in and out. The left mouse button translates

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,550 align:middle line:90%
like this left and right, up and down, as
does dragging on your track pad with three

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,709 align:middle line:90%
fingers with a Mac or with a single finger
click down if you really want to give yourself

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,459 align:middle line:84%
RSI.

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,910 align:middle line:90%
You've also got the option to right-click
with a mouse which will tilt your view, or

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,349 align:middle line:90%
on a trackpad that is two fingers held pushed
down. So have a little practice of just saying

00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,330 align:middle line:90%
to yourself for instance I want to see the
underside of the cube, how am I going to get

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,489 align:middle line:90%
it? Well I'll zoom in a little bit, I can
use the middle mouse button to translate and

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,840 align:middle line:90%
the right mouse button to rotate so there's
the underside. Or you might say you want to

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,160 align:middle line:90%
see the top so you'd just come up to the top
and there's the top surface lit brightly by

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520 align:middle line:84%
this directional light.

00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,190 align:middle line:90%
Now we'll cover more detail about what a directional
light does later, but just so you don't get

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,800 align:middle line:90%
confused right now I want to explain that
a directional light doesn't matter where it

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,569 align:middle line:90%
is in the scene, if we go to translate mode
and we start moving this light around it will

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,590 align:middle line:90%
have no effect whatsoever. It doesn't matter
how far away from things, it doesn't matter

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,349 align:middle line:90%
where it is in the scene, it only matters
what direction it's pointing in. So one of

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,290 align:middle line:90%
the other tools that we can use is a rotate
tool at the top left here.

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,959 align:middle line:90%
That's "e" on your keyboard; and you'll notice
that if I grab the rotate tool and start moving

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,800 align:middle line:90%
this directional light around, watch what
happens to the cube illumination in the background

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,760 align:middle line:90%
there I'll zoom in a little bit for you, you
see it is being illuminated differently depending

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,670 align:middle line:90%
purely on the direction of this light you
see it's a light being cast across the whole

00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,030 align:middle line:90%
see depending on the direction in which it
is pointing and it has parallel light rays,

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,690 align:middle line:90%
as you can see. It's a bit of a weird light,
there's not really any real light like this,

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,870 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very simple light to get you off
the ground.

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,530 align:middle line:90%
Great so have a play, get used to a work flow
that works for you, a combination of mouse

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,959 align:middle line:90%
buttons, and possibly modifier keys down the
bottom left of your keyboard, ctrl, function

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,379 align:middle line:90%
shift etc. Have a play, keep your eye up at
the top left see what effect your keys are

00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:25,110 align:middle line:90%
having on your view mode and just make sure
that you know how to move around the scene;

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,969 align:middle line:90%
that you know how to use this tool here which
is the translation tool to move things independently

00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:35,110 align:middle line:90%
in x, y and z by grabbing the appropriate
arrows, and also free-form by grabbing the

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,849 align:middle line:90%
box in the middle; and then also you have
a rotation tool again, you can free-form rotate

00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:45,719 align:middle line:90%
by clicking on the object or rotate around
a particular axis by grabbing its' coloured

00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:50,779 align:middle line:90%
ring; and then you have a scaling tool which
works in a very similar way. You can scale

00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:55,710 align:middle line:90%
the whole object by dragging the box in the
middle, or you can scale in a particular axis.

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,099 align:middle line:90%
OK? I'm now going to reset the transform of
the cube and refocus on it by double clicking,

00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:06,319 align:middle line:90%
There it is, it's a one by one by one unit
cube now we're calling units centimetres so

00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,240 align:middle line:90%
it's like the size of a sugar cube right now.
Always keep it real, always think what this

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,650 align:middle line:90%
means what this would be like in real life,
try and relate it. OK now we're not going

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,279 align:middle line:90%
to try to adjust this thing's size by dragging
because that's a little bit crazy, what we're

00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:24,080 align:middle line:90%
going to do is use the inspector; but I want
you to do this bit so let's go back to the

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,289 align:middle line:84%
slides and look at your challenge.

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:32,379 align:middle line:90%
So what we have for you is I want you to create
a lane floor. Refer back to the GDD for the

00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,939 align:middle line:90%
dimensions, use x for the width, the 105;
y for the height, the 1 cm and z for the length,

00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:42,939 align:middle line:90%
that twenty metres. Apply a texture as a bonus,
if you can work out how to apply a texture

00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:47,129 align:middle line:90%
to it there's a texture in the course assets,
there's a bowling floor wooden texture, or

00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:52,580 align:middle line:90%
get creative, go and make your own texture,
go draw something and make sure that it looks

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,409 align:middle line:90%
right from above when you look at the lane,
that's a bonus for you if you know how to

00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:03,599 align:middle line:90%
do it and a hint it use a cube don't try to
use a mesh or a quad; sorry a plane or a quad

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:11,059 align:middle line:90%
so go ahead pause the video and get your bowling
lane laid out in that orientation right now.

00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:15,169 align:middle line:90%
OK welcome back, so let's do it, let's make
this bowling lane right. So we're going to

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:19,999 align:middle line:90%
change the scale, the x scale so I need to
refer back to my GDD for the dimensions that

00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:28,259 align:middle line:90%
I need, so where are they? Here they are,
bowling lane specification, 1829 so 20 metres

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:37,529 align:middle line:90%
by 105 by 1. OK so it's 105 in the x, fine,
1 cm high that's fine a sort of wooden width

00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:42,490 align:middle line:90%
by 20 metres, or two thousand, so it's gone
crazy it's gone absolutely crazy inside the

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:50,689 align:middle line:90%
scene view, it's gone crazy inside the scene
view because we're so close to it. So you

00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,499 align:middle line:90%
double click it and it will frame the whole
object.

00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,550 align:middle line:90%
So there we are, we have a bowling lane. It's
a bit white right now and that's because of

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,369 align:middle line:90%
the material on it so the next thing that
we need to show you how to do is how to apply

00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:05,240 align:middle line:90%
a sensible material to this guy. So if you
look over in the inspector when selected on

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,219 align:middle line:90%
cube you will see a materials arrow and you'll
see it has a single element - a single material,

00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:15,520 align:middle line:90%
we're only going to be dealing with single
material at the moment, but it's a default

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,369 align:middle line:90%
material, and that's not a lot of use to us,
we actually need to create a new material.

00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:27,219 align:middle line:90%
So if you go to your assets menu, create and
material and you can just call it floor there

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:32,710 align:middle line:90%
it is. So we now have a floor material which
we can apply to the cube, and you can do that

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,309 align:middle line:90%
by just dragging it to the cube if you want
and if you check over in the cube then you

00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:40,189 align:middle line:90%
can see that it has actually put it in to
the element 0 of the floor materials. You

00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:42,449 align:middle line:90%
can have multiple materials but we're not
going to bother right now, we're going to

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,069 align:middle line:90%
have a single material. So let's take a look
at this material we've just created, click

00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:51,349 align:middle line:90%
on your floor material in your assets and
over in the inspector we can start to take

00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:52,669 align:middle line:84%
a look at what it's all about.

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,860 align:middle line:90%
So in Unity 5 we have a standard shader which
is the one that I'm going to suggest that

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,439 align:middle line:90%
we use for now and it's actually very powerful
and very configurable. Now of course a bowling

00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,629 align:middle line:90%
floor would be slightly shiny and reflective
but I'm going to leave out the issue of making

00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:10,939 align:middle line:90%
this reflective at least until the end of
this section, possibly until much later in

00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,379 align:middle line:90%
the course because it's a little bit more
detailed and I want to focus on just getting

00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,330 align:middle line:90%
you used to the 3D environment for now. If
you want to as a side project try and make

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,689 align:middle line:90%
the floor reflective then that's entirely
up to you. so firstly it's the albedo is what

00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:27,719 align:middle line:90%
we're going to focus on today with this so
if you click under main maps and then albedo,

00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:32,240 align:middle line:90%
you can see that you can give a colour cast
to the entire floor, this is called its' diffuse

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,180 align:middle line:90%
colour, its default colour so you can just
drag around in your colour picker and make

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,690 align:middle line:84%
your floor a flat colour of whatever you like.

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,750 align:middle line:90%
So that is fine if you just want it to be
a flat colour but how about if we want a texture

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,780 align:middle line:90%
on there? If we want to put an image? So this
is where you have your first opportunity for

00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,280 align:middle line:90%
creativity is to go and find your own image
on google images or create your own and you're

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,620 align:middle line:90%
going to need to tile that image down the
floor or have a very long and thin image.

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,070 align:middle line:90%
So to help you off the ground we've given
you an asset package at the beginning of this

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,540 align:middle line:90%
section if you go to import package / custom
package we have our bowlmaster assets. Why

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,810 align:middle line:84%
not just import them all.

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,990 align:middle line:90%
Now this time for the first time in the course
all these assets are going to import into

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,450 align:middle line:90%
a subfolder called start pack. That makes
it easier for us to export and somewhat easier

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,380 align:middle line:90%
for you to choose. So, our floor, looking
at our floor material again if you click the

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,400 align:middle line:90%
little circle next to albedo there, then it
will bring up a list of textures one of which

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,720 align:middle line:90%
now should be the lane texture so choose the
lane. A couple of things happen here firstly

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,750 align:middle line:90%
it renders a very strangely stretched, very
ugly piece of wood onto the floor, why does

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,960 align:middle line:90%
it look like that? Well, if we look at the
image we gave it it's just this lane image

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,410 align:middle line:90%
here, and that has been applied once sideways
and once in the z direction so it's very,

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,210 align:middle line:90%
very very stretched, OK that's currently the
problem.

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,650 align:middle line:90%
So the other thing you should notice is that
if you look at the material is that it gives

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,760 align:middle line:90%
you a slight preview of the material right
here in the inspector. It's giving you an

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,240 align:middle line:90%
idea wrapped on a sphere what that material
may look like. A material is simply something

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,130 align:middle line:90%
that tells you how things are going to look.
So the first thing that we need to is to tile

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:13,610 align:middle line:90%
this material appropriately, so here under
cube, and then inspector if you can't see

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,750 align:middle line:90%
the details of the floor material by the way
it's a bit strange but you expand out with

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,510 align:middle line:90%
this little triangle or by clicking the grey
bit where I'm clicking now and that will toggle

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,560 align:middle line:90%
whether you're seeing details of the floor
shader.

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,720 align:middle line:90%
So you have this piece of wood in you can
still adjust the albedo which just multiplies

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,880 align:middle line:90%
basically each of the red, green and blue
components by your colour, so you can offset

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,270 align:middle line:90%
the colour if you want to. We're going to
leave it as it is for now. The main problem

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,540 align:middle line:90%
that we have is this tiling so looking at
our floor image, how many times do we want

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,930 align:middle line:90%
this to tile left and right? Well, one of
the easiest ways is to click on the x and

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,390 align:middle line:90%
just drag it until it looks about right. Well
now you can't tell because it's tiling far

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,480 align:middle line:90%
too infrequently in y so drag your y until
it starts to look about right; and you can

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,850 align:middle line:90%
just iterate here getting closer to the floor
until you get a parquet floor effect - or

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,690 align:middle line:90%
whatever texture you guys want to use - that
looks something like what you're satisfied

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,000 align:middle line:84%
with.

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,190 align:middle line:90%
So maybe I tile this guy maybe 50 times in
one direction, and, well, how many in the

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,420 align:middle line:90%
other well we ought to use the same aspect
ratio potentially so 50 by 2, 50 by 1, whatever

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,040 align:middle line:90%
looks right at the end of the day you know,
does that look right? Looks OK, looks a bit

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,620 align:middle line:90%
weird, 50 by 12 obviously too much in the
x direction. So look, it's up to you guys

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,820 align:middle line:90%
to make this floor look beautiful, I'm just
trying to show you; give you the tools of

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,030 align:middle line:90%
how to do it. I have a floor that has a tiling
- now it's not the tiling on the floor material;

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,310 align:middle line:84%
it's the tiling on the cube.

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,800 align:middle line:90%
The tiling on the cube is 2 by 50 which means
that we're taking that image, that floor image;

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,910 align:middle line:90%
we're repeating it twice in the x direction
and 50 times in the y direction as we go down

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,770 align:middle line:90%
the lane. Alright? So that gives us a somewhat
convincing floor. Later, at some point in

00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,040 align:middle line:90%
the course we'll talk about how to make it
reflective. Fantastic, so the final thing

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,360 align:middle line:90%
I said that we were going to do here is to
make the main camera face down the lane. We've

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,410 align:middle line:90%
been moving around in the scene view, but
if we click over to game, well, it happens

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,430 align:middle line:90%
to be facing down the lane, but let's imagine
that we want to put it somewhere different,

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,630 align:middle line:84%
how do we do that?

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,330 align:middle line:90%
Well one easy way to do that is to go to where
you want the camera to be in the scene view

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:20,380 align:middle line:90%
like say here, get it how you want it, select
the main camera and then you've got a very

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,190 align:middle line:90%
useful game object / align with view, so the
game object in question is the camera and

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,030 align:middle line:90%
we're aligning it with our current scene view
by doing that we now move the camera so when

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,140 align:middle line:90%
you click play and switch over to the game
view we get exactly what we wanted. That's

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,870 align:middle line:90%
everything we need to do in this lecture,
congratulations on getting your first 3D object

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,870 align:middle line:84%
created and I'll see you soon.
