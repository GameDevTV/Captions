00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey welcome back! I want to

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
spice up our game. with a little bit of smoke. using Particle

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Systems. When a brick is destroyed like that. I want to see

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a smoke puff come out. and I'd like the smoke puff to

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
be the color of the brick that got destroyed.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So. let's look at how we're going to do that.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In this lecture we're going to cover the following: We're going to

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
create a simple Particle System. we're going to make a brick

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
look like it goes up in smoke. we're going to write the

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
code to trigger smoke puffs. and then. at the

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
end we will tweak the smoke prefab. while play testing

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to get it looking right. So. what's a Particle System?

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
An extract from Unity's document say it's "for effects

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
like moving liquids. smoke. clouds. flames and magic spells...

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Particle Systems can be used to capture the inherent

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
fluidity and energy." You can read more about it here.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So. let's start off by putting an empty Game

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Object into our Play Space. and I'm going to call it smoke.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In the Scene View.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
let's move it somewhere where we can see it. for a moment.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and add a component to it called Particle

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
System. Over in Inspector. Add Component. Particle System.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now immediately. you'll get this default Particle System

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
here. Pretty fun hey! Let's take a look at some

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of the settings. Duration 5 means that it's a

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
5 second loop. basically. that this

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
goes around in. and the Start Lifetime

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is how long the particles last for. If the particles

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
say lasted for 1 second. let's see what happens.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Each one dies out. after 1 second.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but the effect has a lifetime of

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
5 but because we are looping you don't see that. So. if you take it off

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
loop now. now you will see that you get

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
5 seconds of emission. of particles that

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
last 1 second. I hope that makes

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
sense. The other option is we could turn that around the other way. We could

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
have 1 second of emission.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and it stops at particles that last 5 seconds.

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Cool! So look. we're going to play with the details

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of this later. so for now. I'm just going to set it to

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
1 second and 1 second. I think.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And then. I'm going to come

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
down and have a look at what other things I can change. Now.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
one of the things I'm going to want to look at is the Emission Rate.

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Are my particles coming out too fast or too

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
slow. and also the shape of the emission.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well. I'm going to go for a box. in my case.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so let's have a look at that. Ah. that's kind of

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
more like it. So. imagine this

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
was where a brick was.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Yeah. that's kind of OK!

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Yeah OK! So. let's use this

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
as a starting point. So. my settings are 1 second duration.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
1 second lifetime. I haven't changed

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the Emission criteria. but I've changed the shape to a box

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and just left it at that for now. OK. so if we

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
were to just run the game. then that would just happen and go away.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So. that's all very well. but we're going to need this

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to happen at run time. so because of that. we need to

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
prefab the smoke. So. let's go ahead and prefab the smoke now.

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm going to do that. by dragging the smoke that I have

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
into my

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Assets Folder. down here. I'm also going to

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Reset the Transform on the prefab. And then. I

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
get rid of the smoke. from the scene. So now. if I

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
was to drop smoke back into the Hierarchy I would

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
end up with it down at the bottom left. which is what I'd expect. And it's

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
blue. so it's prefabbed. Awesome!

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So now. what I want to do is I want to challenge you

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to make the smoke get triggered. when

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
a brick gets destroyed. I'm going to get you started.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
let's go into Brick.cs. and I'm going to tell you that we're

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
going to need to expose ourselves a GameObject.

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and I'm going to call it smoke.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Alright. and then the moment we've exposed that

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
GameObject smoke. if you look at your brick prefabs on the

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
green. red. and yellow. all of those are going

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to want the Smoke Prefab.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Alright. so I've made public GameObject smoke.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and then. I've come back to the Inspector and dragged the

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Smoke Prefab into the green. red. and yellow. In

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
my case. all my breakable bricks now have a

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
smoke attached to them. We're using the same smoke. for all of them

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
at the moment. Your challenge is as

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
follows. I want you to instantiate smoke at

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
runtime. Here are some hints. Instantiate the Smoke

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Prefab as a GameObject. It's position

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
should be the brick's position. When you check the

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
docs. you'll notice it needs a rotation. Just use Quaternion

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
.identity. and don't worry about what that means. for now. it just means it's

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
upright. And test that you get white

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
smoke puffs. when the bricks are destroyed. Don't yet try and make them the same

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
color as the bricks. One step at a time. let's just get white

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
smoke puffs. when bricks are destroyed. Here are Unity's docs

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
for Object.Instantiate. and

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
hopfully using those and a bit of willing. you can get that going.

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So. pause the video and do that challenge now.

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
OK how

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
did you get on? This is how I've solved this problem.

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I'm looking into my Brick.cs

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
script. firstly to see where I want to do this.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Well. I want to do it immediately before I destroy the GameObject.

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
so the method is Instantiate.

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Then. we need the smoke.

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
which we defined up at the top and we publicly

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
inserted it. Now. what's the position... What's the

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
position of the brick? Well. it's gameObject. because we're on Brick.cs.

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It's the instance of the current gameObject.transform

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
.position. And then. I said we're going to use Quaternion

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
.identity. for just a default

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
upright rotation. That's the line I'm adding.

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Instantiate smoke. at the position

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
of the brick. with default rotation. Let's

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
have a look.

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Oh yes. and that's exciting!

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So. let's just make sure it works on other brick types. by firing

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the ball up the side.

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Of course. these guys take a few hits to go. There you go!

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
White puffs are being generated. so if you did

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that all on your own. congratulations! Now. let's move onto the next

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
step. which is getting the puffs colored.

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So. your challenge again is. store the smoke

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
puff. that you just generated. as a GameObject variable.

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So. just add to the line we just created. so that you

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
store this thing. Then.

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
using the right dots. set the

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
smoke's start color to the same as the brick.

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and test that different bricks make different smoke.

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
As a hint. the color that you want to set

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
comes from the brick's sprite renderer. So. pause

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
the video. and have a go at making colored smoke. right now!

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
[Temporary Silence]

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
OK welcome back! Let's take a look at how to do this thing!

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Firstly. let's make this method...

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Sorry. this Variable that captures the thing we

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
instantiated. So. it's a GameObject. and I'm going to call it

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
smokePuff

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
= that. So now. we have

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
smokePuff as a local variable. which is

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the very smokePuff we just instantiated.

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Now. we can start messing with it. smokePuff

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
dot. Now. smokePuff dot what?

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Well. let's have a look in Unity. at a smoke puff.

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Here's a smoke puff. so

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
it's a GameObject. and then. we need to look at it's particle system.

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Dot particleSystem

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
dot. OK. let's keep going. Dot start

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Color. Ah. that looks promising. smokePuff

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
.particleSystem.startColor =.

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Now. the second half. where do we get

151
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
this color from. Well. we need to get it from the brick. And what about

152
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the brick? Well. it's the brick's sprite renderer.

153
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So. it's gameObject.

154
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Now. you can't get to sprite

155
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
renderer. so we're going to have to GetComponent

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
<SpriteRenderer>

157
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Like that and then dot.

158
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
What do we go for?

159
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Color. OK hopefully

160
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that makes sense to you. So. we're taking the current

161
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
brick. we're getting the SpriteRenderer component off it.

162
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and then. we're getting the color. whether it's yellow. green.

163
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
or red. and then. we're setting that to the color of the particle

164
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
System. Let's have a go and see if it works!

165
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
OK!

166
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So. the error is on line 45. and it says it

167
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
can't convert a Unity Engine object to a GameObject.

168
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Are we missing a cast? So. it's hinting at a possible

169
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
solution. Let's have a look at the docs for Instantiate.

170
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
very briefly. In fact. they're sitting here.

171
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
They return an object not a GameObject.

172
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So. this line here is not returning.

173
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
This Instantiate method does not return a GameObject. it returns

174
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
an object. So. we need to

175
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
say at the end. as GameObject;

176
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
now. that line has got a little bit long. but actually you can remove

177
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
gameObject from .tranform.position.

178
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
because it's going to assume we're talking about the current GameObject.

179
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So. your line 45. in my case. can become this.

180
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The GameObject. smokePuff

181
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
variable. that we're going to use to store. is the result

182
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
of Instantiating a new smokePuff at the position of

183
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
brick with default rotation. but when we

184
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Instantiate. we want to cast it from being a general object to

185
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
being a more specific GameObject. Then. we can work

186
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
on the smokePuff GameObject properly. Let's try

187
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
now.

188
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Awesome! Yellow puff. yellow

189
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
puff. and off we go! Let's just test

190
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
other colors. make sure that they work OK!

191
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Then. red bricks take a little

192
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
while to go. Great!

193
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Look at that and all the colors are mixing together. Fantastic!

194
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So. now that you've done that. you can go into your Smoke Prefab.

195
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and you can mess around all you like with the

196
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
factors down here. You could

197
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
click Random Direction on your shape. for instance.

198
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and see that. that has a dramatic effect on it. I find

199
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that very distracting. but the great thing is that because we're

200
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
using prefabs. any changes we make to the Particle System now

201
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
will apply everywhere. I'm going to leave mine like this.

202
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and I'm also going to do a quick tidy up of my

203
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
code. I don't think this HandleHits () is very

204
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
easy to read anymore. so I'm going to make a new method

205
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
called PuffSmoke.

206
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
which is just going to move out the code from that Handle

207
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Hits () method; all of the stuff that deals with

208
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
puffing smoke. which is really simple. it's

209
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
just two lines there. So. I'm just going to do that and I'm

210
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
just going to say PuffSmoke(); just because

211
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I want to be able to see. in the HandleHits what happens.

212
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
a bit more clearly. Just to prove that works.

213
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and there it goes.

214
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So congratulations! Let's just take a recap of what we've learned in

215
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
this lesson. We have

216
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
created a simple Particle System. made a brick look

217
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
like it goes up in smoke. written code to trigger those

218
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
smoke puffs. and tweaked the Smoke Prefab while play testing.

219
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
at the end. Awesome job! Well done! See you soon!

=======

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey welcome back! I want to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
spice up our game, with a little bit of smoke, using Particle

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Systems. When a brick is destroyed like that, I want to see

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a smoke puff come out, and I'd like the smoke puff to

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
be the color of the brick that got destroyed.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, let's look at how we're going to do that.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In this lecture we're going to cover the following: We're going to

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
create a simple Particle System, we're going to make a brick

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
look like it goes up in smoke, we're going to write the

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
code to trigger smoke puffs, and then, at the

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
end we will tweak the smoke prefab, while play testing

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to get it looking right. So, what's a Particle System?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
An extract from Unity's document say it's "for effects

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
like moving liquids, smoke, clouds, flames and magic spells...

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Particle Systems can be used to capture the inherent

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
fluidity and energy." You can read more about it here.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, let's start off by putting an empty Game

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Object into our Play Space, and I'm going to call it smoke.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In the Scene View,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
let's move it somewhere where we can see it, for a moment,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and add a component to it called Particle

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
System. Over in Inspector, Add Component, Particle System.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now immediately, you'll get this default Particle System

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
here. Pretty fun hey! Let's take a look at some

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of the settings. Duration 5 means that it's a

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
5 second loop, basically, that this

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
goes around in, and the Start Lifetime

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is how long the particles last for. If the particles

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
say lasted for 1 second, let's see what happens.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Each one dies out, after 1 second,

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but the effect has a lifetime of

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
5 but because we are looping you don't see that. So, if you take it off

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
loop now, now you will see that you get

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
5 seconds of emission, of particles that

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
last 1 second. I hope that makes

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
sense. The other option is we could turn that around the other way. We could

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
have 1 second of emission,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and it stops at particles that last 5 seconds.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cool! So look, we're going to play with the details

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
of this later, so for now, I'm just going to set it to

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
1 second and 1 second, I think.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And then, I'm going to come

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
down and have a look at what other things I can change. Now,

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
one of the things I'm going to want to look at is the Emission Rate.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Are my particles coming out too fast or too

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
slow, and also the shape of the emission.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, I'm going to go for a box, in my case,

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so let's have a look at that. Ah, that's kind of

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
more like it. So, imagine this

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
was where a brick was.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, that's kind of OK!

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah OK! So, let's use this

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
as a starting point. So, my settings are 1 second duration,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
1 second lifetime. I haven't changed

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the Emission criteria, but I've changed the shape to a box

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and just left it at that for now. OK, so if we

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
were to just run the game, then that would just happen and go away.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, that's all very well, but we're going to need this

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to happen at run time, so because of that, we need to

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
prefab the smoke. So, let's go ahead and prefab the smoke now.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to do that, by dragging the smoke that I have

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
into my

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Assets Folder, down here. I'm also going to

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Reset the Transform on the prefab. And then, I

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
get rid of the smoke, from the scene. So now, if I

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
was to drop smoke back into the Hierarchy I would

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
end up with it down at the bottom left, which is what I'd expect. And it's

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
blue, so it's prefabbed. Awesome!

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So now, what I want to do is I want to challenge you

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
to make the smoke get triggered, when

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
a brick gets destroyed. I'm going to get you started,

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
let's go into Brick.cs, and I'm going to tell you that we're

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
going to need to expose ourselves a GameObject,

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and I'm going to call it smoke.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Alright, and then the moment we've exposed that

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
GameObject smoke, if you look at your brick prefabs on the

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
green, red, and yellow, all of those are going

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
to want the Smoke Prefab.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Alright, so I've made public GameObject smoke,

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and then, I've come back to the Inspector and dragged the

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Smoke Prefab into the green, red, and yellow. In

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
my case, all my breakable bricks now have a

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
smoke attached to them. We're using the same smoke, for all of them

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
at the moment. Your challenge is as

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
follows. I want you to instantiate smoke at

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
runtime. Here are some hints. Instantiate the Smoke

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Prefab as a GameObject. It's position

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
should be the brick's position. When you check the

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
docs, you'll notice it needs a rotation. Just use Quaternion

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
.identity, and don't worry about what that means, for now, it just means it's

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
upright. And test that you get white

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
smoke puffs, when the bricks are destroyed. Don't yet try and make them the same

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
color as the bricks. One step at a time, let's just get white

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
smoke puffs, when bricks are destroyed. Here are Unity's docs

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
for Object.Instantiate, and

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
hopfully using those and a bit of willing, you can get that going.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So, pause the video and do that challenge now.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
OK how

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
did you get on? This is how I've solved this problem.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm looking into my Brick.cs

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
script, firstly to see where I want to do this.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, I want to do it immediately before I destroy the GameObject,

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
so the method is Instantiate.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Then, we need the smoke,

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
which we defined up at the top and we publicly

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
inserted it. Now, what's the position... What's the

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
position of the brick? Well, it's gameObject, because we're on Brick.cs.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's the instance of the current gameObject.transform

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
.position. And then, I said we're going to use Quaternion

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
.identity, for just a default

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
upright rotation. That's the line I'm adding.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Instantiate smoke, at the position

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
of the brick, with default rotation. Let's

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
have a look.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh yes, and that's exciting!

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, let's just make sure it works on other brick types, by firing

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the ball up the side.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Of course, these guys take a few hits to go. There you go!

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
White puffs are being generated, so if you did

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that all on your own, congratulations! Now, let's move onto the next

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
step, which is getting the puffs colored.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So, your challenge again is, store the smoke

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
puff, that you just generated, as a GameObject variable.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, just add to the line we just created, so that you

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
store this thing. Then,

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
using the right dots, set the

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
smoke's start color to the same as the brick,

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and test that different bricks make different smoke.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
As a hint, the color that you want to set

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
comes from the brick's sprite renderer. So, pause

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the video, and have a go at making colored smoke, right now!

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
[Temporary Silence]

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OK welcome back! Let's take a look at how to do this thing!

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Firstly, let's make this method...

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Sorry, this Variable that captures the thing we

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
instantiated. So, it's a GameObject, and I'm going to call it

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
smokePuff

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
= that. So now, we have

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
smokePuff as a local variable, which is

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the very smokePuff we just instantiated.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now, we can start messing with it, smokePuff

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
dot. Now, smokePuff dot what?

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, let's have a look in Unity, at a smoke puff.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Here's a smoke puff, so

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it's a GameObject, and then, we need to look at it's particle system.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Dot particleSystem

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
dot. OK, let's keep going. Dot start

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Color. Ah, that looks promising, smokePuff

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
.particleSystem.startColor =.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Now, the second half, where do we get

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
this color from. Well, we need to get it from the brick. And what about

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
the brick? Well, it's the brick's sprite renderer.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, it's gameObject.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now, you can't get to sprite

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
renderer, so we're going to have to GetComponent

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
<SpriteRenderer>

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Like that and then dot.

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What do we go for?

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Color, OK hopefully

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that makes sense to you. So, we're taking the current

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
brick, we're getting the SpriteRenderer component off it,

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and then, we're getting the color, whether it's yellow, green,

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
or red, and then, we're setting that to the color of the particle

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
System. Let's have a go and see if it works!

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
OK!

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So, the error is on line 45, and it says it

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
can't convert a Unity Engine object to a GameObject.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Are we missing a cast? So, it's hinting at a possible

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
solution. Let's have a look at the docs for Instantiate,

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
very briefly. In fact, they're sitting here.

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They return an object not a GameObject.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, this line here is not returning.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This Instantiate method does not return a GameObject, it returns

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
an object. So, we need to

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
say at the end, as GameObject;

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
now, that line has got a little bit long, but actually you can remove

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
gameObject from .tranform.position,

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because it's going to assume we're talking about the current GameObject.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So, your line 45, in my case, can become this.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The GameObject, smokePuff

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
variable, that we're going to use to store, is the result

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
of Instantiating a new smokePuff at the position of

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
brick with default rotation, but when we

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Instantiate, we want to cast it from being a general object to

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
being a more specific GameObject. Then, we can work

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
on the smokePuff GameObject properly. Let's try

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
now.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Awesome! Yellow puff, yellow

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
puff, and off we go! Let's just test

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
other colors, make sure that they work OK!

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Then, red bricks take a little

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
while to go. Great!

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Look at that and all the colors are mixing together. Fantastic!

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So, now that you've done that, you can go into your Smoke Prefab,

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and you can mess around all you like with the

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
factors down here. You could

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
click Random Direction on your shape, for instance,

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and see that, that has a dramatic effect on it. I find

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
that very distracting, but the great thing is that because we're

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
using prefabs, any changes we make to the Particle System now

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
will apply everywhere. I'm going to leave mine like this,

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and I'm also going to do a quick tidy up of my

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
code. I don't think this HandleHits () is very

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
easy to read anymore, so I'm going to make a new method

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
called PuffSmoke,

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
which is just going to move out the code from that Handle

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hits () method; all of the stuff that deals with

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
puffing smoke, which is really simple, it's

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
just two lines there. So, I'm just going to do that and I'm

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
just going to say PuffSmoke(); just because

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I want to be able to see, in the HandleHits what happens,

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a bit more clearly. Just to prove that works,

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and there it goes.

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So congratulations! Let's just take a recap of what we've learned in

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
this lesson. We have

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
created a simple Particle System, made a brick look

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
like it goes up in smoke, written code to trigger those

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
smoke puffs, and tweaked the Smoke Prefab while play testing,

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
at the end. Awesome job! Well done! See you soon!
