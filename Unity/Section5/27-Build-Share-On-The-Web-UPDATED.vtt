00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey so it's time for you to build and

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
share your levels now! We can't wait to see what you make, in

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the discussions. See if you can be the first person to get

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it there, or if there are already lots of games there, see if you can beat what's

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
already there. So, in this lecture we're going to revise

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
your game window. We're going to tell you how to tweak your

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
sound levels. We're going to do a little test web build.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We're going to revise building and sharing to the web, and the, we'll look

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
forward to seeing what you make. So firstly, how do we change

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the relative sound levels? Well, here are your three places.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Number one, the Master Volume, you can change at: Edit &gt; Project Setting &gt;

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Audio. Let's take a little sneak

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
peak at that, shall we! Edit, Project Settings, Audio.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There you go!

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And here you have Volume. I've got mine set down to 0.25,

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you might like yours at... You probably want to start at 1,

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to be honest, so maybe you want that as 1, and then, only turn it down

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
if you have a specific reason to. So,

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
1 is fine, and then, you can see that, that just makes everything

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
loud or quiet. Cool! So, that's the first thing.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And then, so what's the next thing that we can

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
change? Well, the "Boing" sound needs

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to be changed on the Ball Prefab, on the AudioSource.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's take a look at that! Ball Prefab, Audio

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Source, and then,

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
here Volume. OK, so I'll leave my Boing as say

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
at 0.51. So, you've got a Master Volume,

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
no particular reason for you to turn that down, I don't think, unless you want to a

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
quiet game. You've got the volume of the Boing here.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You've also, and I haven't put it on the slide, but you've

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
also got the sound of the

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Music Player, and that again, you go Music Player,

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
which is the instance here. And then, Volume and that's

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
at 0.25, that's the same technique,

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and then, the final thing you're going to want to be able to change is possibly

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the volume of the "Crack" sound.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now, if you click on this reference to the AudioSource

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
PlayClipAtPoint source, you'll find that

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we have another parameter we're not using, which is the Volume.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So, the way you would change the Crack is, you would come into Brick.cs

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and here you would say play Crack, at this

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
position and say 0.8f);

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
float. And then, when you build, when you run the game,

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you'll find that all those things, the Music

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Volume, the Crack Volume,

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and the Boing Volume, you can customize. So,

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
please consider making your own sounds. Just simply make

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
your own .mp3's or .ogg's or

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
whatever you like, and stick it in here and

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
replace these sounds. Make sure they're not 3D when you bring them

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
in, otherwise they may be very quiet and unpredictable.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And then, we really want your to make your own scenes now. Just

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
lots of scenes with lots of nice, different background images, and crucially,

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
lots of different block layouts. I suggest as the levels

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
go on, you make them harder and that you introduce

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
new block types. You may want Level 1 to just have yellow.

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Level 2 maybe has two types, three,

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
you know three types, however you like!

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I've done it slightly differently to that. Get creative!

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Get making some cool stuff right now! You know, play with

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
how transparent the background image is. So, my background here

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
is probably too...

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
...probably too alpha, I can't really see it at all. So, I could bring it up,

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
make it a bit more pleasant. Just tweak, play,

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
enjoy! Alright, so the next thing I want to do is remind

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
you that when you're testing inside Unity,

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
this Game Window here, you want to set it to

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
800 by 600, if that's going to be our target build.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Now, when it says, using resolution that, that means that

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
currently this thing is too small for it to show the full resolution. So, you could

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
detach your Game Window, and it can be tricky to detach

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
it, you have to fiddle around until it snaps out. I'm having real trouble

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
now. Oh, there it is! OK, and then you could,

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
at that point, make it bigger than 800 by 600,

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and so it stops moaning. There you go! And then, this is a great

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
place! By the way, there's a nice keyboard shortcut, Command or Control P,

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to start playing. And this is a much better place to test

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
your game, so this will give you a very good idea about

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the sounds and the look the your game and the playability.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Then, what you're going to want to do is actually

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
build this for the web, and do a test build to start with.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, go to Build Settings.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You want to make sure all your scenes are in here, starting at Start

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and going through the levels in order, then, Win then Lose.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Then, you want to go to Web Player Settings, and I'm going to

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
make 800 by 600 my target revolution. [Laughs]

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Resolution, revolution. [Laughs at Fumbleing Words] I'm going to go for a black

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
background, I think and that's it! So,

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
800 by 600, black background. I'm

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
going for and I'm going to Build And Run now.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now, it's going to say, where do you want me to put that? Downloads is OK.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It's going to compile the scripts

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
build. Hopefully you get no errors at this point. If you do get errors,

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
at this point, try and work out the error

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
yourself and then, if you're not sure ask in the discussions.

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Then, you'll end up with a web build running in your browser, like this! You may have

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
to allow your plugin to run.

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This is the real test of whether it's going to run in the browser properly.

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
[Music &amp; Sound Effects Playing in Background]

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So, is it running properly? Well it is, but my

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
screen is too small, because I'm broadcasting

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
to you and 720 pixels. It's a little bit to small to be able to

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
see what's going on. So, if I was

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to go full screen on this, then we should be OK.

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
View, Enter Full Screen.

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It may just be OK. Actually, I'm not

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
sure. Yeah, I've just got 600 pixels left, with all these Menu Bars.

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I think I could...

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I could probably get rid of my bookmark bar

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and that would help a little bit. There you go!

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
[Sound Effects Play] And the web build seems to be working.

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, once you're happy with your web build, like that, go back

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
into Unity,

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and well, if the build you just did

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to the File System was OK, you are good to go. Even

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
if it was called test. So, I would probably save everything in Unity,

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
so you can even quit Unity at this stage

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and you can quite MonoDevelop. Everything will be saved,

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and then, you need to go and find that thing, that Test

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Folder, in my case. So, now is a good time to

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
rename your folder, because when you share with GameBuck.io

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
it'll be this folder name that it uses in the URL.

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, I'm going to call it Block Breaker. You can call yours

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
whatever you like. So, there you go! My folder is called Block

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Breaker, and inside, it doesn't really matter what the files are inside.

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
In this case, they're test.html. And test.unity

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
because that's the name we give it, when we export it. That's all just fine!

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So, what you do, as before very quickly, is we just compress

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the whole folder. Go to www.gamebucket.io,

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Upload the folder.

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
You'll see that the URL, when it comes back,

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
contains the name of the folder.

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It's going to take a little while to upload, because it's a bigger

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
game. Here you go, the Block Breaker. The percent 20, as a

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
space, is there in the URL. Now as before, remember

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
test properly in incognito,

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Private Window Mode. Here you go! Make sure

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that it's nothing to do with you being logged into anything. Make

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
sure it works, make sure it fits. All the sound balances OK.

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Then, you've got your URL, copy that URL.

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I suggest you keep the browser open, because we don't want to lose it.

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And as before, go into the discussions

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
in Udemy and

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
share your game, on the discussions and on

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Facebook. So, in this video we've covered

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
revising setting your game window, so that you can preview

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the effect of your resolution. We've tweaked the sound levels,

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
in various different places. We did a test web build

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and played it locally. We revised building and sharing to

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the web, using www.gamebucket.io and that's it!
