00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi. so in this optional video. I'm going

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to upgrade Block Breaker to Unity 5. So.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
if you have Unity 5 installed. then you can

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
go ahead and upgrade the project to Unity 5. and then. I'm going

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to do a Web GL buiild. So. when

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you try and open Block Breaker.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in Unity 5. you're going to get this message that's saying: "The project contains scripts

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and or assemblies that use obsolete API's". That sounds

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a bit jargony. there are some changes in Unity 5. I'll

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
show you them. once we have actually made the upgrade.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So. before you do it. please do make

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a .zip of your Unity Folder. Close your project. make a .zip.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or if you're using version control. take a commit and do make

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that backup first. and then. go ahead. It won't break

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
it by the way. but if you want to be able to go back to Unity 4.

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you need to make the backup. OK. so then what you do is you

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
click the button. and it will. in a moment. open up like so.

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now. here is Block Breaker in Unity 5. Let's go

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to our Start Menu Scene. And as you can see it looks

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
largely the same. Let's try playing it. The music is

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
working. And is the game working?

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
[Boing Sound Effects in Background] Yep. my daughter's sound effects.

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's all working just fine. Now. there are some times

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
some things that are a little different in Unity 5. Like for

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
example. when you have a UI. then the

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
vertical order of things in this UI

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Hierarchy can change what renders on top of what. but that's not

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
causing us a problem here. Let's just check both the Start

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Menu and the Win Screen for that. and the

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Lose Screen. all looks OK. So. the thing that you'll

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
notice that's actually changed is all just to do with

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
these scripts. There's been some minor changes to the

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
scripts. Let me show you. This is my Version Control System. but let's take

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
an example of. say the ball. and what

35
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it's done for us is. instead of being able to just say

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
ribidbody2D. we now have to say.

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
GetComponent. angle brackets. Rigid

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
2D. and then. normal brackets dot.

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So. that's the bit in the middle there. this GetComponent

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and that goes for other things as well. like AudioSources  rather

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
than just saying AudioSource.Play when you say GetComponent

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
AudioSource.Play. So. basically

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Unity has fire walled all of these different components. so the we actually

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
have to make an explicit get for them but that's fine.

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That's a very minor change and it will actually do it for you. you can see

46
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
it everywhere. GetComponent. So. it's made those changes

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
for you. Great! So. what I want to show you briefly

48
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
now. is how to do a Web GL Build. Game Bucket

49
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is all ready for a Web GL Build. so you just come to File. Build Settings.

50
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
here. Now. if you're in Unity

51
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
5 there's a new option. WebGL Preview there.

52
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
so we switch the platform to that.

53
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And then. you'll see at the top. this is also

54
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
a difference in Unity 5. after the project name you get Web GL

55
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
as the platform name and then. personal is the edition of

56
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
[Fumbles Words & Laughs] Udemy. Udemy. Unity. Unity.

57
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and then. we build and run. And it's going to say. where do you want me

58
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to go? Well. I'm put it. say in my downloads.

59
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
for example.

60
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
[Typing Sound]

61
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And there we go! If you compile it. and you'll get a file that

62
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
you can put in Game Bucket. in the same way as you put your other projects

63
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
in there. or as I showed you earlier in this section. and you

64
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
will be able to host your game. The difference with the Web GL

65
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Build. of course. is that you do not need

66
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
or the player does not need to have the Unity Plugin. It

67
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
works purely off HTML 5. which most all

68
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
modern browsers support. So.

69
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
after a while you should notice your browser open like this.

70
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You will be able to play the game in a web browser. but this is a

71
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
locally hosted version of your game here. and you

72
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
can see that it says Unity Web GL. at the bottom. And you can make it full

73
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
screen. and it runs beautifully. without using a Unity

74
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Plugin. which is great. So. how do we get this

75
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
up to Game Bucket. Well. what you want to do

76
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is look in the folder that you stored your project

77
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
in. So. in this case it was Web GL Build in my Downloads.

78
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Just zip up that entire folder. just compress it. Now. you

79
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
can do that in Windows or Mac in a similar way.

80
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Compress it like so. and then. once you have the

81
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
.zip file. you simply upload that .zip file

82
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to Game Bucket. And It'll take a little while but when it's finished you'll

83
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
get something like this. you'll just get your game hosted inside Game Bucket.

84
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You can take that URL. check it in an incognito

85
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
browser tab like this. just to simulate you not

86
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
being logged in. and then. you'll know that if you share that with your friends.

87
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that this is exactly what they'll see. And they don't need a

88
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Unity Plugin. So. there you go! Web GL Build and Unity

89
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.966
5. See you soon!

Hi, so in this optional video, I'm going

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to upgrade Block Breaker to Unity 5. So,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
if you have Unity 5 installed, then you can

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
go ahead and upgrade the project to Unity 5, and then, I'm going

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to do a Web GL buiild. So, when

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you try and open Block Breaker,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in Unity 5, you're going to get this message that's saying: "The project contains scripts

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and or assemblies that use obsolete API's". That sounds

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
a bit jargony, there are some changes in Unity 5. I'll

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
show you them, once we have actually made the upgrade.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, before you do it, please do make

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a .zip of your Unity Folder. Close your project, make a .zip,

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that backup first, and then, go ahead. It won't break

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
it by the way, but if you want to be able to go back to Unity 4,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you need to make the backup. OK, so then what you do is you

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
click the button, and it will, in a moment, open up like so.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, here is Block Breaker in Unity 5. Let's go

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to our Start Menu Scene. And as you can see it looks

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
largely the same. Let's try playing it. The music is

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's all working just fine. Now, there are some times

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
some things that are a little different in Unity 5. Like for

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000

vertical order of things in this UI

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hierarchy can change what renders on top of what, but that's not

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
causing us a problem here. Let's just check both the Start

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Menu and the Win Screen for that, and the

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Lose Screen, all looks OK. So, the thing that you'll

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
notice that's actually changed is all just to do with

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
these scripts. There's been some minor changes to the

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
scripts. Let me show you. This is my Version Control System, but let's take

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
an example of, say the ball, and what

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it's done for us is, instead of being able to just say

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
ribidbody2D. we now have to say,

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
GetComponent, angle brackets, Rigid

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
2D, and then, normal brackets dot.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So, that's the bit in the middle there, this GetComponent

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and that goes for other things as well, like AudioSources  rather

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
than just saying AudioSource.Play when you say GetComponent

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
AudioSource.Play. So, basically

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Unity has fire walled all of these different components, so the we actually

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
have to make an explicit get for them but that's fine.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's a very minor change and it will actually do it for you, you can see

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it everywhere, GetComponent. So, it's made those changes

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
for you. Great! So, what I want to show you briefly

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000

in. So, in this case it was Web GL Build in my Downloads.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Just zip up that entire folder, just compress it. Now, you

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
can do that in Windows or Mac in a similar way.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Compress it like so, and then, once you have the

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
.zip file, you simply upload that .zip file

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to Game Bucket. And It'll take a little while but when it's finished you'll

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
get something like this, you'll just get your game hosted inside Game Bucket.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can take that URL, check it in an incognito

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
browser tab like this, just to simulate you not

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
being logged in, and then, you'll know that if you share that with your friends,

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
that this is exactly what they'll see. And they don't need a

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Unity Plugin. So, there you go! Web GL Build and Unity

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,966
5. See you soon!
