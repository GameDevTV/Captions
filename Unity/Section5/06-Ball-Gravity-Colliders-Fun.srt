00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey. welcome back! So. the next thing we need to

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
do is. add a ball to our scene. I think. and then. we can

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
pop a ball in the middle here. And we're going to arrange for a little bit of

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
gravity to pull it down. so that it falls out the bottom of the

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
play space. So. let's start with that.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So. you've got your assets. in the assets that we gave

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you to download. or go and find your own ball image.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My Block Breaker assets are

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
here. So. a little

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
simple mini challenge for you. I want you to add this ball to the

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
play space. as follows.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Number 1. import the ball sprite into the Sprites Folder.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Play with the sensible Pixels Per Unit yourself.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to get the scale of that ball right. and then.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
place the ball right in the middle. precisely in the middle of the play

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
space. So. go ahead. pause the video and do that now.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
See you in a second.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Fantastic! So. this is how I'm doing it. I'm popping the ball

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in the Sprites Folder. The ball. at the

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
moment. is just a sprite. Now. we don't know whether 100

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is a suitable pixels per unit. so I'm going to drop the

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
ball where I want it. in the scene. roughly in the middle here and then have a

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
look. Now. that ball is firstly very not visible

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and secondly. not very big. so I'm going to try going

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
upwards or downwards. with the pixels per world unit.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but if I go less pixels per

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
unit. that thing will get bigger. and actually let me show you a trick here.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If you hover your mouse over the word Pixels Per World Unit. you'll see that

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
you can drag left and right. It doesn't have much of an effect here.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because it doesn't update immediately. but that's a useful facility

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the Editor. I'm going to try 50

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and apply. There you go. the ball has doubled in

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
size. I'm actually going to throttle back my background

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
image a little more. so it's darker.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Ah. there you go. the ball is clearer now.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Fantastic! So. that's stage 1. We

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
have a ball in the scene. I just want to make it precisely

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
in the middle. So. what is the middle? Well. explore the space 16

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
wide by 12 high. so it must

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
be 8. 6.

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Perfect! Ball in the middle of the scene. as planned.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
OK. now the next thing we want to do. if we play the game.

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
you'll notice

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that the ball just sits there. We want it to fall

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
out the bottom of the screen. and actually we want that to trigger the Game Over.

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
at some point. So. let's start by. how do we make the ball

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
fall. Well. it needs some physics. it needs to have a component

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
on it. called a Rigidbody. The first thing I'm going to do is

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
just rename the ball. with a capital B. just to be tidy.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and then. I'm going to add a component. Physics

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
2D Rigidbody2D.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
What's a Rigidbody? Well. the best way to find out is to look at it.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You can straightaway see that it has to do with its Mass

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and its Drag and its Gravity Scale.

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
What's the mass unit? Well. it's unitless really. but if

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you consider that one unit is a kilogram. then that's a

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
reasonable starting point.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Excuse me. We're not going to worry about drag or angular drag right

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
now. Gravity Scale of 1.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
let's try it let's see what happens. click play.

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
There it goes! The ball falls

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
out the bottom of the scene. That's fantastic! So. that is a

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
great start! So. what we want to do now

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is have some way of that ball

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
triggering the end of the level. rather than us having to

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
click the Game Over Button.

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And while you're here. by the way. you'll notice we have

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
some work to do on this screen but that's fine.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Rather than clicking Game Over. we want the ball to do that work for us.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So. let's at least get the ball to log to the

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Console. when it falls off the bottom of the screen. How are we going to do

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that? Well. we need something called a collider. What's

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
a collider? We're going to cover that in different videos.

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in detail. but I'm going to give an overview here. So

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
firstly. the ball will need a collider on it. It is a

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
physical body. now it has a Rigidbody. but it has no

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
collider. Go and find the collider. under Physic 2D.

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Circle Collider 2D. if you zoom right in.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm rolling my mouse button to do that. you'll see that this is fitted Itself

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
quite well to the size of the

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
ball. You could change the radius using that technique perhaps.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I showed you before. you click in the Inspector

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
on the word Radius and hold the mouse button. Then. move left and right

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
slowly. and you'll see that the radius changes.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But about 0.2 isn't far off

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
at all. and that green circle

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
is the extent of this thing. called a collider.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
That's fine. we want it just like that. it's not going to be a trigger actually.

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
because the ball is going to physically collide with things.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So. the difference with a trigger... Well. let's look at their docs. remember you can hit.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
what I just did there was hit the Blue Book. So.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
hit the Blue Book. to go to the docs. and it'll tell you.

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
What's a trigger? Does the collider behave as a trigger? Not particularly

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
helpful. So. let me tell you what a trigger is. A trigger is

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
something that is going to ignore the Physics Engine.

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
OK. the moment you click that. it would no longer collide and

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
actually appear to hit things. So in the case of the ball. we do want it

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to actually hit things and exhibit physics.

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So. that's one half of the puzzle. of making this

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
ball trigger a new level. It's still just going to fall out the bottom. when we click

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
play. because it's got nothing to

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
trigger with. Colliders work by hitting other

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
colliders. In fact. I've got a slide prepared for you.

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that talks about colliders. Give me one moment to find that.

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
There you go! What is a collider? It's a component that

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
defines "the shape of an object. for the purposes of physical collisions."

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
"A collider. which is invisible. need not be the exact same shape as the object's."

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And there's a link there to Unity's docs. on colliders.

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The point is. you need two colliders. so

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
let's add a second one. Create yourself an

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
empty GameObject.

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I'm going to call it.

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
LooseCollider. I think.

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
[Typing Sound]

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
[Screeching Record Sound] No! That's not how you spell

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Lose! That's Loose you numpty. Oh.

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
well sorry. but it's going to stay like that until the end

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
of this section. where I will correct it. It's not possible to

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
change it in every single video. without re-recording the whole lot. which would be

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
crazy. And at the moment. this is nothing right. This

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
thing is just a transform. a GameObject.

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But we're going to add

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
to it another component. which is that collider again. This time.

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
a Box Collider. and this will all come clear in a minute.

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Look if we make the size in X 16.

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
because that's the width of our

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
play space. and then. if we move this thing

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
down to a position at the bottom of the screen.

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
you could put it at a Y of 0. It would probably do.

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Preferably. just

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
below our play space actually. so maybe a Y of minus

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
a half or something. Maybe even minus

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
1. depending on the width. the vertical width

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of your collider here. Well. actually it doesn't depend. because of where the

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
anchor is. you can have as big a collider as you like look.

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And the anchor point of the collider stays there.

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So. I'm going to have a collider that's 16 wide by 1 height

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and that sits at a Transform Position of 8. -1 there.

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
OK. and this one is a trigger.

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
because we don't want the things staying on this.

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Well. actually it kind of. in this case

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it doesn't matter. Firstly. let's look at the behavior. what happens to this ball.

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Well. in this view you can't see it.

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
so what we want to do is hit pause. then play.

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Now. go back. Now.

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
once it's playing. make sure you're on the Scene View and un-pause.

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You see the ball passes straight through

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the bottom of the play space. That's

149
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
tricky to see. so what you might need to do is move your Game Tab next

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
to your Scene Tab. like that. Try this.

151
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
watch what happens. The ball passes

152
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
straight down through that collider. which is fine. If this

153
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Lose Collider was not of type trigger.

154
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
try and see what happens now.

155
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
You see it lands on it and just stays

156
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
there. So. actually either of those behaviors would work

157
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
for this. because at the end of the day all we're trying to do

158
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is trigger the loading of a new level. when this

159
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
happens. So. that's an overview

160
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
of how we're going to get the ball to trigger the new level. And we'll go

161
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
into detail about how we handle it from there. in script

162
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.633
shortly.
