1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So. here we are happily creating

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
multiple scenes in our game. and we

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
have a great Prefabrication System. where we have all

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the main things we need to create a new scene. setup

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as prefabs. The challenge we have is

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a couple of things break every time we try to make a new level.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One of them is the link between the

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Paddle and the Ball. So. the Ball needs

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to see an instance of a Paddle.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and there's no way that we can link the prefabs together.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We have to do this every time we create a new

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
scene. and we wouldn't want a designer having to think about

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
these type of details right. So basically.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we want a designer to be at very easily setup new

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
levels. to take the friction out of the process. So. that's

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
one problem. is that the ball and the paddle don't meet. and the other

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
problem. you'll see when the game ends. is that the LevelManager

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
here is similarly broken. So. if we

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
click on the LooseCollider.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
it's expecting a LevelManager. and yes. sure I could

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
drag the LevelManager in but I don't want to

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
have to do that. so let's show you what we're going to do.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In this lesson. we're going to talk about why

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
linking prefabs programmatically helps. I've just explained

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that. Unity doesn't support Nested Prefabs.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
so we basically can't drag prefab to prefab and expect

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it to maintain the connection. So. we're going to use something

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
called GameObject.FindObjectOfType&lt;&gt; OK.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and we're going to link things programmatically.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so our designers basically don't have to do it.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Cool! So. let's link the ball and the paddle this way.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If we go into the script for the ball. at the moment.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
it's a public Paddle paddle; So. what I'm going to

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
do is. instead of public I'm just going to make it private.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so it's no longer exposed in the Inspector.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And then. in the Start method. the first thing I'm going to

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
do is say paddle =. Now.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
follow me through with this one. It's GameObject.Find

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and when you type that you'll see a load of options. We're going

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to look for. it's a single object not a multiple object.

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
it's a single level manager. so we want FindObjectOf

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Type. Now. you're very welcome to look at the docs for that

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and see by example how it might work.

44
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Here they are! And you can see it being used

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
here. This is one way. static "FindObjectOfType);"

46
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In fact. it's the only one they show you. And let's

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
look at the example. While they do it like this.

48
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm going to do it a slightly different way OK. So. just

49
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
follow my example through. because it's going to be more consistent

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
with other things. So. we're going to use a pair of

51
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
chevrons to do... Well. it's actually something called generics. it's

52
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
kind of like a filter. We're saying. I only want to FindObjects

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that are or Type. whatever I put in the chevrons.

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's still a method. so we'd still need these curly brackets.

55
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but we have the chevrons just before the curly brackets.

56
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And what type of thing are we finding? Well. we're finding a &lt;Paddle&gt;.

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It's actually as simple as that!

58
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Yes. now that's right! There's only a single thing of type &lt;Paddle&gt; in the

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
entire game. So. when we say that we

60
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
declare our Paddle at the top here. so it's available to all of these

61
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
methods. because remember we're using Paddle down here. In fact.

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
if I do a search we can see all the places we're using Paddle.

63
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So. we declare it there. and then. immediately when the game starts we go looking for

64
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the Paddle. so that we don't have to associate it in the Editor.

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Let's have a look at what happens now! If we run!

66
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
OK. we are getting

67
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
no exception error. Hang on. let's go to the Start Menu.

68
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Let's run all the way through.

69
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
OK fine! So. that

70
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
level is working fine! If we look at Level_01.

71
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and we look at it's LevelManager and we look at its Ball.

72
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
it no longer has a Paddle

73
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
associated. and when we look. when we move the paddle around

74
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the ball sits on it. Level_02.

75
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
when we move it around it sits on it. and

76
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
if we were to create a new level it would work but we'll do

77
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that at the end. as a complete test.

78
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So. I want you to do the same thing for the LooseCollider. Let's fix

79
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that other problem. I want you to make the public instance variable

80
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
private. That's the instance of the LevelManager.

81
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
remember the LooseCollider needs the LevelManager to load the next

82
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
level. So. make that private and then. do the same thing.

83
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Find the LevelManager using exactly the same method

84
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
type that I used before. Obviously. it'll be a different type

85
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in chevrons.

86
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And test that it also loads properly and works. So. have a go at that

87
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
now!

88
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
OK welcome back! So. I'm going to go into

89
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the LooseCollider. I'm

90
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
going to make my LevelManager private.

91
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and then. in the Start here. I'm going to stop printing ("Trigger").

92
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
by the way. I just don't need it anymore. I'm going to go LevelManager.

93
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Laughs] Pirate. private!

94
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
OK. so levelManager

95
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
=

96
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
GameObject.Find.

97
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It's a static method. ObjectOfType

98
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
What's the type? &lt;LevelManager&gt;

99
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
a bit weird looking function this. isn't it?

100
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
OK cool! So. let's try that! So.

101
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
hopefully our LevelManger now no longer needs to be associated

102
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in the Editor. Let's go to the very Start Scene.

103
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and make sure it works!

104
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
OK cool! Now. Start goes to

105
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the End Scene. straight away. which is

106
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
fine. Let's just test it from Level_02 and make sure

107
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Level_02 also works. Yep.

108
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
goes straight to the End Scene! So. obviously at some point we're going to want

109
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Level_01 going to Level_02. and I'll show you that

110
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
in another video. For now. let's just make sure that we

111
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
can actually create a third level. that our prefabs are

112
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
right. So. let's create a new scene or level.

113
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Scene and level are used interchangeably. It's

114
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
untitled. so let's save it straight into

115
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Scenes.

116
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
There it is. Level_03! Now.

117
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
this is the proof of the pudding. Grab one of all of the prefabs. drop

118
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
them in. ditch the Main Camera.

119
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
You could. by the way. make an even higher order

120
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
prefab if you wanted. of all these things like that

121
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
but let's not bother with that. Just so that they're always in the right order. There is

122
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
no right order in the Hierarchy. It's just that I like to see

123
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Main Camera. LevelManager. Play Space. Ball.

124
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Paddle. or that could just be me bing OCD.

125
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
OK. so let's try this! Off it goes! Of course. it's got

126
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
a default background. and it goes to the End Screen.

127
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Awesome! So. our prefabrication is working! Look. we have

128
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
fixed the issue with the ball leaving the paddle. By default they're

129
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
associated properly now. because they're associated in code.

130
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And the other thing that's working is that the LevelManager is

131
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
now associated and linked to the

132
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Loose Collider. so it's all working programmatically.

133
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
This is huge progress! We've not got three levels. it's now

134
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
become a trivial matter to create more levels. Of

135
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
course. in your new level. you can drop as many blocks in as

136
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
you want. Probably best. when you first drop them

137
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in. to drop them into the Hierarchy

138
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
on the left here. because then they'll be on grid.

139
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and then. you can drag them around

140
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
from there. If they ever get off grid. remember Edit. Snap Settings.

141
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Snap All Axes.

142
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
In fact. saying they'll be on grid. look! We have a minor problem with our

143
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
prefab. They're not on grid! You see this guy

144
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I just dropped into the Hierarchy. is not on

145
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
grid. So. why is that? That

146
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
is because. if we look at the prefab for these guys

147
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
for these bricks. their default position is

148
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
actually not on the grid and that's not very good. So. let's

149
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
fix that right now. Let's take a look at

150
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
what would be on grid. for instance. 9.92

151
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
is a position that's on grid. Let's apply that position

152
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
to the prefab. for the green brick.

153
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
for the yellow brick.

154
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and we also need to make sure that

155
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the red brick is on the tab. This is the default

156
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
position of the red brick. Again. being

157
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
careful! See that's slightly off grid! You see that?

158
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You need to make sure that your prefab

159
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
default positions are on grid. Now.

160
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
they all are. provided that I Apply.

161
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
You see these have gone bold. they're different to the prefab.

162
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Click Apply and it should

163
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
change the prefab. Now. all of the prefabs have a Y

164
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
position of 9.92 and slightly different

165
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
X positions. That's desirable. let's see the benefit.

166
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
If I now drop in three different

167
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
bricks. into the

168
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Hierarchy. they all go in. in slightly different positions.
