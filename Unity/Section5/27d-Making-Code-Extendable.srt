00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
welcome back! So. in this video. we're going to talk about the coding trade

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
off triangle. It sounds mysterious. almost sounds like

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Bermuda Triangle. We're going to think about our

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
future self on the project. also mysterious.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then. we're going to do the simple things. which are renaming a Game

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Object and class. and we're going to use Debug.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
LogError(). for the first time. So. what's this triangle thing?

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well. you've probably heard of a cost

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
quality time trade-off. in project management.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
or even if you haven't. there's something similar when you write code.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You can write code that runs fast.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you can write code that's easy to extend.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and you can write code that's fast to write.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but you don't get to do all three.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The better you are. the closer you can get to

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
doing all three. but really you need to pick two.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So if code runs fast

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it's very easy for somebody to extend in the future. then it's

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
probably taken a long time to write. If it's

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
easy to extend and build on in the future. and it was very

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
fast to write. then it probably doesn't run very fast.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And if it's fast to write and it runs fast. then

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it probably isn't easy to extend. So.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
what we're going to do where is just think about it

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
extending our code. Imagine we come back to this in a few years

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
time. What can we do to improve it. so

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that when we get back to it. it makes more sense to us?

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Well. just a couple of simple challenges to you.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
A thank you to John. for pointing out that I spelled

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
lose wrong. in the Lose Collider

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Prefab. So. I'd like you to change the prefab name. it's a little

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
fidley. Also. change the script

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and class name. and make sure the game still runs.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So. pause the video and change loose to

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
lose. throughout your game. now please.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
[Temporary Silence]

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So welcome back! There's a couple of good learnings in here. Let's

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
dive into Unity. take a look. So firstly. we go into

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
our prefabs. One of the beauties of prefabs is that. however

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
many levels you've got. when we change this Lose Collider we

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
only change it in one place. So. how do you find it? Well. it's

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
nested under the Play Space. so click on Assets.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Prefabs. Play Space. open the drawer with the little

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
triangle. and then. we're looking for Lose Collider.

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now. I'm going to rename it. up in the Inspector. and then. I'm going to hit Return.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And then. I'm going to check that in this particular level.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
it has changed. It has but you'll notice a little bit of a

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but or a querk of Unity is that. it hasn't yet changed.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
certainly on my machine. within my Assets Drawer. but

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
if I save the projet it does update.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Great so. that's one place! Now. we 've got somewhere else

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
we need to change that. If we again go to the

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Lose Collider Prefab. it's got a script on it. and the

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
script has got the wrong name. Let's go into the script here. Lose Collider.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
There we go. Now. this is the class definition. You

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
need to change the class definition is one thing. save your script.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and then. you need to rename the script as

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
well. They need to be in sync in C#. so you

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
rename your script here. at the Asset Manager

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and you change your class name. inside the script

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
at the top. where it says public class LoseCollider.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That brings it all into sync. Let's now that we've made these changes. have

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
a test that the thing still works and that we can

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
still lose. Good! And let's

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
just check a couple of other levels. to make sure that

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the Lose Collider is still spelled correctly. Awesome!

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Well done. if you've managed to do all those things yourself! You're really starting to

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
find your way around Unity. Got another challenge for you now! Here we go!

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Let's take a look at the next one!

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I want to add some "guard code" in Brick.cs.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so that when a sprite is missing. you get an error log to the console.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So at the moment. we check to see if

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
there is a sprite available to load.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
for a given brick. but we don't log to the

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Console. an error if there isn't. So. thanks to Ole

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
for pointing this out. So. I want you to do that.

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Rather than using Debug.Log. like we normally do. just use

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Debug.LogError. The only difference

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
with Debug.LogError is. when you look at your

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Console. it will come up as a different

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
type. so it'll come up as an actual error. because it's quite serious. So.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
you can choose what level of error you log out. and we're

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
going to be logging out a error. in this case. So. go

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
ahead and do that.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
[Temporary Silence]

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Cool! Welcome back! So relatively easy and it's going to be a good

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
revision of what goes on in Brick.cs. So. open up your

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Brick.cs. I'm going to put an extra line

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
space in here. So. this if statement says. if (hit

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Sprites[spriteIndex]). Well. that's really saying

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
if (hitSprite[spriteIndex]) does not equal

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
null... OK. let's just put that does not

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
equal null in. just to prove that it has no effect

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
on the game. the game still runs exactly the same.

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
OK. it still works fine.

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But that's what it's really saying. It's saying if (hitSprites [spriteIndex])

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
doesn't equal null. i.e. that is.

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a sprite at this sprite index. But how about if

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
there isn't a sprite? At the moment. it just does nothing. it doesn't load a sprite.

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So. I'm going to say else.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This is where we put our Debug.Log. Now. look what we've

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
got. We've got errors. exceptions. and warnings.

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
They're your three types. well actually four types. you can just

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
log. You can log an error. an exception. and a warning. We're

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
just going to log an error here. It just comes up in a slightly different

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
filter. in a different color.

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
[Typing Sound]

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
("Brick sprite missing");  OK. you see what I've

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
done there. If it can't find a sprite. at that position in the index. when it

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
gets to it. it says there's a brick sprite missing. So.

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
obviously when I run as normal. we get no

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
problems no errors. If I pause and

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
look at the Console. we have no errors. but how about

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
if I was to go to my Prefabs

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and bravely take. say off the red.

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
one of the

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
hit sprites. this Element 1 here. Let's

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
make that none. OK. now let's see what happens when we

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
run. When I click play...

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Let's pause.

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Here you go! In the Console. we have a red

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
warning. You can filter on and off these errors here.

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and it says. error "Brick sprite missing".

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
OK fantastic! So. again congratulations

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
if you did that! If you've tested by taking a sprite off. like I did.

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
just pop it back on. just so that everything

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
works. And that's it! So congratulations!

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Just by way of a quick recap for you.

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
we have looked at the coding trade off triangle.

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Remember. things Run Fast. they're Easy to Extend. or they're

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Fast to Write. but you don't get to really do all three.

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We've thought about our future self on the project and said. well

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
if we see Loose Collider rather than Lose.

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that's a bit confusing. so let's change that. We've also

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
said it's going to be a bit confusing if a

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
sprite doesn't swap out; it'd be much more useful to have an error.

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And then. we've looked at renaming Game Objects and Classes.

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and we've used a different type of Debug.Log. just so that you

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
can stream your logs into different

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
severities. levels of severity.

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So congratulations. and I will see you soon!

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
welcome back! So, in this video, we're going to talk about the coding trade

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
off triangle. It sounds mysterious, almost sounds like

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the Bermuda Triangle. We're going to think about our

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
future self on the project, also mysterious.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And then, we're going to do the simple things, which are renaming a Game

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Object and class, and we're going to use Debug.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
LogError(), for the first time. So, what's this triangle thing?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, you've probably heard of a cost

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
quality time trade-off, in project management,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or even if you haven't, there's something similar when you write code.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can write code that runs fast,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you can write code that's easy to extend,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and you can write code that's fast to write,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but you don't get to do all three.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The better you are, the closer you can get to

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
doing all three, but really you need to pick two.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So if code runs fast

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and it's very easy for somebody to extend in the future, then it's

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
probably taken a long time to write. If it's

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
easy to extend and build on in the future, and it was very

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
fast to write, then it probably doesn't run very fast.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And if it's fast to write and it runs fast, then

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it probably isn't easy to extend. So,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
what we're going to do where is just think about it

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
extending our code. Imagine we come back to this in a few years

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
time. What can we do to improve it, so

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that when we get back to it, it makes more sense to us?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, just a couple of simple challenges to you.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A thank you to John, for pointing out that I spelled

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
lose wrong, in the Lose Collider

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Prefab. So, I'd like you to change the prefab name, it's a little

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
fidley. Also, change the script

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and class name, and make sure the game still runs.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, pause the video and change loose to

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
lose, throughout your game, now please.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
[Temporary Silence]

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So welcome back! There's a couple of good learnings in here. Let's

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
dive into Unity, take a look. So firstly, we go into

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
our prefabs. One of the beauties of prefabs is that, however

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
many levels you've got, when we change this Lose Collider we

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
only change it in one place. So, how do you find it? Well, it's

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
nested under the Play Space, so click on Assets,

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Prefabs, Play Space, open the drawer with the little

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
triangle, and then, we're looking for Lose Collider.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, I'm going to rename it, up in the Inspector, and then, I'm going to hit Return.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And then, I'm going to check that in this particular level,

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
it has changed. It has but you'll notice a little bit of a

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but or a querk of Unity is that, it hasn't yet changed,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
certainly on my machine, within my Assets Drawer, but

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
if I save the projet it does update.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Great so, that's one place! Now, we 've got somewhere else

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we need to change that. If we again go to the

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lose Collider Prefab, it's got a script on it, and the

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
script has got the wrong name. Let's go into the script here, Lose Collider.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There we go. Now, this is the class definition. You

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
need to change the class definition is one thing, save your script,

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and then, you need to rename the script as

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
well. They need to be in sync in C#, so you

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
rename your script here, at the Asset Manager

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and you change your class name, inside the script

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
at the top, where it says public class LoseCollider.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That brings it all into sync. Let's now that we've made these changes, have

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
a test that the thing still works and that we can

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
still lose. Good! And let's

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
just check a couple of other levels, to make sure that

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the Lose Collider is still spelled correctly. Awesome!

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well done, if you've managed to do all those things yourself! You're really starting to

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
find your way around Unity. Got another challenge for you now! Here we go!

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's take a look at the next one!

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I want to add some "guard code" in Brick.cs,

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
so that when a sprite is missing, you get an error log to the console.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So at the moment, we check to see if

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
there is a sprite available to load,

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
for a given brick, but we don't log to the

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Console, an error if there isn't. So, thanks to Ole

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
for pointing this out. So, I want you to do that.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Rather than using Debug.Log, like we normally do, just use

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Debug.LogError. The only difference

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
with Debug.LogError is, when you look at your

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Console, it will come up as a different

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
type, so it'll come up as an actual error, because it's quite serious. So,

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you can choose what level of error you log out, and we're

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
going to be logging out a error, in this case. So, go

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
ahead and do that.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
[Temporary Silence]

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Cool! Welcome back! So relatively easy and it's going to be a good

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
revision of what goes on in Brick.cs. So, open up your

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Brick.cs. I'm going to put an extra line

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
space in here. So, this if statement says, if (hit

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sprites[spriteIndex]). Well, that's really saying

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
if (hitSprite[spriteIndex]) does not equal

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
null... OK, let's just put that does not

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
equal null in, just to prove that it has no effect

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
on the game, the game still runs exactly the same.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
OK, it still works fine.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But that's what it's really saying. It's saying if (hitSprites [spriteIndex])

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
doesn't equal null, i.e. that is,

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
a sprite at this sprite index. But how about if

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
there isn't a sprite? At the moment, it just does nothing, it doesn't load a sprite.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, I'm going to say else.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is where we put our Debug.Log. Now, look what we've

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
got. We've got errors, exceptions, and warnings.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They're your three types, well actually four types, you can just

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
log. You can log an error, an exception, and a warning. We're

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
just going to log an error here. It just comes up in a slightly different

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
filter, in a different color.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
[Typing Sound]

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
("Brick sprite missing");  OK, you see what I've

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
done there. If it can't find a sprite, at that position in the index, when it

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
gets to it, it says there's a brick sprite missing. So,

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
obviously when I run as normal, we get no

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
problems no errors. If I pause and

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
look at the Console, we have no errors, but how about

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
if I was to go to my Prefabs

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and bravely take, say off the red,

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
one of the

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
hit sprites, this Element 1 here. Let's

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
make that none. OK, now let's see what happens when we

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
run. When I click play...

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's pause.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Here you go! In the Console, we have a red

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
warning. You can filter on and off these errors here,

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and it says, error "Brick sprite missing".

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
OK fantastic! So, again congratulations

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
if you did that! If you've tested by taking a sprite off, like I did,

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
just pop it back on, just so that everything

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
works. And that's it! So congratulations!

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Just by way of a quick recap for you,

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
we have looked at the coding trade off triangle.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Remember, things Run Fast, they're Easy to Extend, or they're

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Fast to Write, but you don't get to really do all three.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We've thought about our future self on the project and said, well

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
if we see Loose Collider rather than Lose,

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
that's a bit confusing, so let's change that. We've also

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
said it's going to be a bit confusing if a

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
sprite doesn't swap out; it'd be much more useful to have an error.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then, we've looked at renaming Game Objects and Classes,

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and we've used a different type of Debug.Log, just so that you

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
can stream your logs into different

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
severities, levels of severity.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So congratulations, and I will see you soon!
