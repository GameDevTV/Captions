00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey. so in this video we're going to talk

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
about snapping to grid. So. as we place our

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
blocks. in this play space. the challenge I have

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with it is they're all a bit kind of messy. They're not

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
perfectly aligned with each other and we have too much freedom

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of movement. So. what are we going to do about

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that? Well. there's a not particularly well documented

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Snap to Grid setting. You start by going to

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Edit and then Snap Setting. down here.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And you need to setup your X and Y

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
movement. in this case. so that it's appropriate for our game space.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So. I'd like to be able to move our bricks by half a brick.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
left and right. which is half a World Unit. so 0.5

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and by

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a whole brick. up and down. Now. what was a whole brick? Do you remember what

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the amount of movement was? Well. if you're not sure

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
just try it. pop your brick somewhere.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Put another one exactly

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
one brick above. and if you remember. it was 0.32.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So. the difference between the Y position of this yellow

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
brick is 6. and the Y position of this red

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
at 6.32. So.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
precisely 0.32 in the Y direction.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and rotation. well we're not doing rotation now. so let's

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
leave it. Cool! So. once you've set those Snap Settings. that's

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a start. The next thing you need to do. before you start moving a brick

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
around. is snap the bricks to the axis. So. you could

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
select all of your bricks and snap to axis.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
There you go! They're now all on the grid!

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
See if they weren't on the grid. then I could make a small change.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and then. when you hold down Control

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
or Command. and this is the real key

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
this is the bit that's not well documented. When you hold down the Control

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
or the Command Key while dragging.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that is when you snap to grid.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
OK. so use the Edit. Snap Settings. set

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
initially to the grid. You can multi-select. as I've just showed you.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And now. hold down Control or Command. If I do that with this

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
brick. that's off the grid. it will move by the amount

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we've said. half a brick sideways 0.32 upwards.

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but it's still off grid OK.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So. this is why it is important to snap all of your bricks

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to the grid. Great! So. now that we have

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
snapping in place. why don't you go ahead and build yourself

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a first play space. Personally

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the way I'm going to do that. in this first level. is I'm only going to

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
use two brick types. I'm going to use yellow and green.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and I'm just going to put some fairly unimaginative

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
even lines of bricks. Because remember. we want to

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
introduce the player to the game mechanics. slowly.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
so I think the third brick type could come in later.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So go ahead now and pause the video and

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
build yourself a simple play space. of a few lines of bricks.

54
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
OK cool! So. I'm going to do that now. simply by taking say

55
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the yellow brick. and duplicating it enough

56
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
times. Once. of course. you've done a few bricks you're

57
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
welcome to duplicate the whole lot. so sleek them all in the

58
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Hierarchy and duplicate the whole lot. you see!

59
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Now. OK it's pushed off

60
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
of the play space. but that doesn't matter. I could just move this all

61
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
back in. and if I continue to hold down this Control Key.

62
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
then I'm in good shape.

63
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So. I think I'm going to just put another few bricks on the end.

64
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I think I've got that right.

65
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I've got one too many. So you get the idea. It's just lots of

66
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
holding down Command. while you

67
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
move things. or Control on the PC. and

68
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
of using Command or Control D to duplicate bricks. So.

69
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'll duplicate the green brick a few times. and then. once

70
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I've go the pattern I'll start to...

71
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I may even reorganize things in my Hierarchy

72
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
a little bit. For example. I might put a Sub-

73
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
GameObject in here. that says

74
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Bottom Row. for instance.

75
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And I would then reset the transform of that. because it's an

76
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
organizing object. I would pull it inside the Bricks

77
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Object. and then. here's all the 1 hits

78
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that are on the bottom row. so I can drag them into the Bottom

79
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Row. collapse the BottomRow.

80
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And now. you see I could easily make myself a new

81
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
organizing GameObjec. Reset it's transform.

82
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
call it Top Row. And

83
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
this is just a way of keeping everything really organized.

84
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It goes into bricks there. the two hits go into the Top Row.

85
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and now. when I work on the Top Row.

86
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm a bit more clear about what's where in my Hierarchy.

87
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
OK. just one more brick!

88
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Ah no. two more.

89
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
There we go! So. I've got two rows of

90
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
bricks. Now. the cool thing about having it organized like this is. I could select the Top

91
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Row and Bottom Row together. like that. and then. I could

92
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
simply move them up a bit. you see.

93
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You probably still want to hold down Command or

94
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Control. So. maybe there? There you go! Now. let's test

95
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
that!

96
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So. the bricks

97
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
aren't breaking yet. of course. because we haven't done that yet.

98
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So. to test it properly. you need to kind of launch the ball so it

99
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
ends up through the gap. There you go! Perfect! So. we are really starting

100
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to get the basics of Arkanoid going here. and you

101
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
have the freedom to start creating your own play

102
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
spaces. So. as a recap. the purpose of this video

103
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
was to teach you about the Snap to Grid feature. You

104
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
access it through Edit and Snap Settings. Snap

105
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
your thing initially to the grid. and you can do that with Multi-Select.

106
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
if you've already got lots of things in the scene and then hold down

107
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Command or Control while dragging.

108
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
See you soon!
