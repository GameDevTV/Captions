
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey welcome back! So,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
it feels like time for some play testing to me. So, we could go

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
through, by hand, and play all these levels,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and obviously, if our game was that fun we

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
would. But having just built it, I'm not sure

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I want to sit here and break all of these blocks, it could take some time.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And also, I want to test the stability

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
of later levels at

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
high speeds. So, one way to do this is

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to make the machine automatically move the paddle

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
under the ball, so that if

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the game gets faster and faster or if we just want it to play test

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
itself it can do that. So, that's a pretty cool idea!

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's actually a very simple idea as well. If we go into our Paddle Script,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what we can do on every update

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is look at what it's already doing first. Let's

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
consolidate what it's already doing. Well, it's

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
just moving the paddle, in response to the mouse.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So, let's start by factoring that out. void

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
MoveWithMouse ()

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and then, there we go!

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And what

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we can do is take this code out of here, paste it into MoveWithMouse.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Maybe we don't need so many lines in it anymore?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And we can say, on every frame, we just Move

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
WithMouse. Well, that's

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
fine and boring and we haven't really done anything, but what we

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
could do now is, we could say well let's have a check box against the paddle.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And let's make a public

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
auto play, so it's a boolean. It's either auto playing it

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
or not. autoPlay =

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
false; So, by default it doesn't autoPlay.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alright, let's get rid of this Start method, we don't need that.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Cool! Alright, so then what we

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
do, and here's a challenge for you! I want you to put an if statement in that

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
says, if autoPlay is false, then

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
MoveWithMouse, otherwise just do nothing

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
for now. So, go ahead and do that!

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
OK, so if

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
not (!autoPlay or another way you could have done

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
it is said, if autoPlay ==

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
false, then we're going to MoveWithMouse.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
OK, so that's fine!

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Just be sure we just test and make sure the game still runs. So far, we should

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
have done absolutely nothing, apart

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
from... Let me show you something! Let's not maximize on play,

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
let's go into the game,

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
let's click on the paddle,

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and look, you've got an Auto Play Checkbox!

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, if Auto Play is unchecked the paddle moves,

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
if it's checked the paddle doesn't move, OK.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, that's a start! Now we need, when Auto Play is enabled,

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
then what do we do? else we...

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, let's write a wishful function, one that doesn't

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
exist yet. autoPlay

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
OK Cool!

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to use a capital a for method. Now,

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
autoPlay is read because it doesn't exist. So, how is autoPlay going to work? Well,

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
it doesn't need to return anything,

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it doesn't need to take anything, but it does need to do something

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
so what's it going to do? Well,

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
good question! It's going to

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
simply move the mouse to the

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
position, to the Y position of the ball, so this means the

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
paddle now is going to need to see the ball. Now, we could either drag

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
the ball in or we could find the ball

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
in the Start method, using the GameObject.Find

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and that's what I want to do. So, I'm going to say private

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Ball

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ball; OK, now what I want you to do is put the Start

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
method back in, and then, use Game

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Object.FindObject

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
OfType to find that Ball and assign

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
it to this ball variable. OK, so

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
pause the video and make the Start method find the ball in the scene, so

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
we don't need to drag it into the Inspector.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OK, so it's void Start (). I want you to rewrite this

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so you start feeling confident in removing these things and putting them

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
back in if you need to. ball = Game

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Object.FindObjectOfType

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and then, now let's look at the docs for that!

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What does it want?

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It wants type of GUI

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Texture. That's one way of doing it, you can do type of. Again,

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I always tend to do it the way that's more consistent with the other things

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
that it does, which is &lt;Ball&gt; like that, and then just some brackets.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OK, so we've found the Ball, with any luck,

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in the scene. If we're not sure that we have, we

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
just print (ball); We need the ball because we

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
need to know it's coordinates. Let's check that we are finding

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the ball.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ball (Ball), if you look in the Console, it's found a Ball! Great!

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So, that's good! Pretty boring but it's good! So, this is

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
where the magic happens. What we want to do in simple

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
terms is, we say paddle... Well, why don't we

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
copy what we've done with MoveWithMouse, actually, because most of it's

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
going to be the same. So, we need a Vector3

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
paddle position. Yes, local to this method now,

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
different to this one. Here's a new Vector3,

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
starting at 0.5 and the

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
transform position in the Y. So, we're keeping the

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Y position of the paddle. We are starting

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
at 0.5, but it doesn't really matter where we

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
start, and then, 0f in the

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Z. That doesn't matter either! OK, now we don't

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
care about the mouse position. What we do care about

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is the ball position,

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
= ball.transform.position;

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Alright, so now

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
every frame we move the paddle's X position to

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the (ballPos.x

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
clamping it

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
between... Now, it doesn't like this .x.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
float ballPos... Sorry, I want a Vector3

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ballPos is

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the ball's transform. And then, we say let's move

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the paddle to the ball's x position, not letting it go

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
outside of these bounds, which it kind of shouldn't anyway.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This .transform.position = paddlePos; because we

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
built up this paddlePos vector exactly as before. So, we're doing almost

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the same thing as we did with MoveWithMouse. Let's try

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
it! Let's see what happens!

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, this is

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
me manual playing. If I pause the game, click on

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the Paddle, and check Auto Play, let's see if it

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
works! Ah, look at that!

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Watch what's happening there! So,

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
pretty cool hey! It's very simple, the system

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is just settting the X position of the paddle

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
to be precisely the same as the X position of the ball.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This should, in principle, mean that it

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
misses, because it's a machine and it's

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
pretty fast. There are some instances in which

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
this could fail to do with the speed of the physics

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
calculations, etc. But for now, let's see how it

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
does at play testing this level for us. In fact, it should

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
play test the entire game for us. So, I'm

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
sitting here with my arms crossed, hoping this will work.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now, this is nearly a boring loop, but because we've

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
got our special Random.Range code in this

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
boring loop should not persist. At some

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
point, we should get out of it. There we are! And

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
again, it's trying to get in a boring loop, but we have code that's preventing

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that. There you go! And there's a really kind of weird bounce there!

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So, this is

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
roughly what a human player would have to do.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You may look at this and think, how about if I want to knock the ball

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
off to more of an angle? Well, you could actually

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
change the collider shape on your paddle,

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
as a bit of extra credit, so that it has

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
some little kind of edges on it so that you can

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
actually hit the ball more off to the side.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you're interested in knowing how to do that, then let me know

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
in the discussions, and I will consider posting a bonus

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
video, to show you how to make those fine tunings.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So, what I'm going to do is let it

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
play itself, and then, I'll speed up the video so we can watch the auto

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
play, hopefully running through all of the levels. So,

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
enjoy watching that, yeah, and see you

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
a moment!

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I quite like the fact

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
it gets faster as the level goes on, because it kind of

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
gives you a time limit, in a way, to get the

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
level cleared, because the longer you leave it the harder the game gets.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So, that's a little bit of a mergent, a knid of unplanned

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
behavior. Another option would be that we could introduce lives

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
into the level. A score

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
seems a little bit contrived in this game, because

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
unless you involve time in the score,

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
if you just have a score based on the bricks, of coarse

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you're always going to score the same for every level, which is a bit rubbish.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, you could introduce a score system that involves time,

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
but I really think this game is just a completionism game. It's

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
about actually getting to the end of the level and

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
clearing the bricks and having the patience and tenacity to do that.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When you get to another level, you are

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
going to need to go back to the paddle and set Auto

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Play on, and then, just

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
launch the ball.

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
OK, so that last level is pretty incomplete,

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
so I think we've seen enough of it there, actually. When I see a

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
level looking like that, I'm going to either remove

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the level or embellish the level. So, I think what I'm going

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to do is quickly embellish the level. So, I will start with

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
all of the bricks, that are nicely laid out in Level_02.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going to delete my bricks in Level_03

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
here, because they're pretty ugly. I'm going to paste in Level_02's

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
bricks, and then, inside

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
the bricks I'm going to start looking at

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
maybe replacing a few of these, with invincible

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
bricks. So for example, what I could is go into the yellow

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
here, and replace maybe,

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't know, let's say this one, those

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
two. Maybe that one and that one.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So, just replace a handful of these with something

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
else and that's how I'm going to do it. So, I'm going to drop

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
my thing into here, Bricks, and then I'll have

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
invincible on grid and then I'll start

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
duplicating them. And this already

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
will make the level a little bit more interesting.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And you can get a lot more imaginative than I am on this!

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The other thing you might want to do is use a different background image again.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's not very nice to have the same background image for every level.

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, the way you could do that its just say,

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know, background, for instance, would be very boring.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Images, Search Tools, Usage rights,

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
"Labeled for reuse with modification".

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Size, Larger than 640 x 480.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ideally, we want one that is just 800 by 600.

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That would be easiest, if there is one that's

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
suitable. So, you have a quick flick through.

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you can't find one that's the right size, straight off the cuff,

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
then you just modify one or you go and make

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
one or you get artistic or whatever. I'm going to spend

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
another few seconds looking to see if there's an 800 by 600 image that's

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
suitable here. I'm looking for it more based

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
on size than I am based on whether it's an

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
interesting image. So, now let's see if we can do an

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
800 x 600

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
search, like that.

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Ah, there you go! So, we could have another one from Wikipedia!

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, we could view that image, Save Image As.

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Stick it in our downloads, if you like. That's

224
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
fine! but then, when you get to Unity, you need to be

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
going to your Sprites,

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
importing a new asset from

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
wherever it was, which is here.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm going to call it,

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Level_03 bg,

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
like so, and then, on Level_03 I just want

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
to go to the Play Space, Background,

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Sprite, and

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
make it Level_03 bg like that. Now, why is it down

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
on the bottom left? Why is this not working? If you ever want to

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
change your image, what do we need to do?

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, you need to go to the Sprite Editor and do two things. One thing is, you

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
need to make the Pixels Per World Unit the same as the other images,

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
which I think is 50 actually. Yes 50!

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And that will get the scaling right, but now, why is it in the wrong place?

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, it's in the wrong place because the Pivot

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
point for the others is at the bottom left.

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
OK, so change the Pivot point, Apply, and exit.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And now, we have a different looking level!

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
OK, so now we have another unique

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
level. Cool! So, play testing has

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
worked pretty well! Auto play testing works well! And

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
we've gone all the way through the loop of the game. I didn't quite let it get to the

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
end, because the moment I saw a mankey scene,

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I felt compelled to do something about it. I wanted

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to feel that in Level_03 my bricks were organized

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
properly. In fact, they're still not! I want my Invincible bricks under

252
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
my Bricks Hierarchy, something like that.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And it's looking all a lot nicer now. So, we have this

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
level here, with a robot and two brick types.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh no! We have an invincible in Level_01! I'm going to take that out actually.

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's a bit of an odd one. So, no invincible

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in Level_01. Introduce the complexity of

258
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the red bricks in Level_02, different background. Level_03

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
introduces a third type, the invincible brick, and then, we

260
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
have a Win Screen and a Loose Screen. So awesome! Automated play

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
testing! We have a check box on the Paddle that allows

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
us to auto play!

263
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We're in pretty good shape here, really now, to be thinking about

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
building our own version of this

265
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
to the web. So, I want you to get really creative with your levels. Build as

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
many levels as you want. Make sure your build

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
order here is... Not there, sorry!

268
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
...under your project, there! Your build

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
order, project Build Settings. File, Build Settings.

270
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Make sure you start with your Start Menu, then, go through your levels

271
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
in order. Then the Win Screen, because remember, when you pass from Level_03

272
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
onto the next level you want it to be the Win Screen, and then,

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
the LooseCollider will leap frog us to the Loose Screen if

274
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that happens. So cool! Congratulations on that bit, and I'll

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
see you soon!
