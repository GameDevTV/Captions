
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So now, we have the full basic

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
framework for a level. What I'd like to do now is make

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
everything a prefab, so in this lecture

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we are going to prefabricate practically everything, apart from the

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
bricks. Make a few other tidy ups and changes,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
like making the Main Camera's background black,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
moving the Loose Collider into a group,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and moving it in the scene a little bit, and we'll test by making a new level.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, let's take a look at this.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Each of these things, these instances here, like the Main Camera,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the LevelManager, they all have

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
value in them, and we want to capture that,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
ready to start creating future levels. Sure our core

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
mechanic isn't finished yet. For instance, bricks can't break etc.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but we're going to sort that out later and I want

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to use the fact that we're going to be changing core

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
mechanics to test and put pressure on the quality

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
of our prefabrication. If we've done it properly, then when

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we change things, it'll change across all levels. So, we're going to

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
make several levels now, and then, we will

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
come and change the core mechanic after that. So, it's going to be fun!

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Check it out! So, one thing I'm noticing is this horrible

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
blue cast to the background, and that's because the background

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
image, in the Play Space, has transparency,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
has an alpha of 35% and it's,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
if you look at the Main Camera, it has a blue background. So, first thing

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to do is set the Main Camara's background to black.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Ah that's better, everything suddenly becomes more visible!

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now, if the background is too dark

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
now for your taste, then you can go into the Background

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and increase its Transparency a little bit. If you

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
want. It's entirely up to you. Great!

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, this is going to serve as a kind of default background, for any kind of future

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
levels. Of course, it can be over-ridden. So,

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to open up my Prefab Folder and go through and make

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
sure each object is tidy, one at a time, and then prefab

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
it, prefabricate it. So, this Main Camera,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
it's good now that it's the right size. It's got a background color,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
etc. So, I'm happy to prefab the Main

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Camera, so we drag it into the Prefabs Folder.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's move down, the LevelManager. Well, this is a novel idea!

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why don't we prefab the LevelManager, so that if we

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
ever make any changes to it, we only have to make them

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
in one place, so I think that's a good plan. But before we prefab

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it, let's Reset it's Transform, because

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
things like LevelManagers should really be at the origin,

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
just for tidiness, otherwise it looks good! Let's prefab

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
it. Play Space, OK the Play Space

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is at the origin, which his good. It has a Background image,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
a Left Wall, a Right Wall, a Top Wall.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I could select all of these and kind of see a visualization

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
of the Play Space. Something that strikes me is that

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the Loose Collider is really part of the Play Space. So, I'm going to move

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the Loose Collider into the Play Space object.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The next thing that strikes me is that there's a gap,

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
where the ball could sneak out down at the bottom

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
here. I don't really like that, so I'm actually going to

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
move the Loose Collider up a little bit

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to -0.5 in Y,

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
like so, so it's

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
tight against the bottom. And I'm also going to make it a little bit wider,

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
18 units wide, like

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
so, so that it all fits snugly. Let's have a look.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When we highlight the Left, Right, Top

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wall, and the Loose Collider, look at that beautiful tight Play

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Space! OK, so now my Play Space is as

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
a whole looks good! I'm just flicking through, it's got

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
a sprite on the Background

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and a Left Wall a Right Wall. All of the transforms look good, so great!

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is a good time you see, as you prefab things, just to get them

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
tight and tidy. So, the Play Space looking good, prefabbing the Play

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Space. Now, look what happens!

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Under the Play Space you've got multiple items. You've got your Background and your

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
walls OK. So, that's a kind of nested prefab,

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
if you like, or at least it's a prefab of a

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
GameObject, with childed objects, so not strictly

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
a nested prefab. OK fantastic!

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So bricks! Are we going to prefab this Bricks placeholder? We don't

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
need to, there's just no need. We already have prefabbed

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
individual bricks, so I'm going to leave that one. The Ball

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I will prefab. Let's just check that it looks sensible.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is a sensible default starting position for the ball.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, it looks OK to me!

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is there anything else about the ball that we want to make sure is OK?

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't think so. It's been working well, so let's prefab it

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and the Paddle. Same deal,

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
it all looks OK, it's in a sensible position. Let's prefab the paddle.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Whew great! So, we have

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
prefabricated everything, apart from the Bricks

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
placeholder GameObject. If you look in the Hierarchy, everything

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
else is blue. Apart from the Bricks and it's

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
sub-placeholders, every other object in the scene is

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
blue, which is good because the only thing that really changes

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
between scenes is the layout

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
of the bricks and also the Background image, which of course we can change

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
on the next scene. Cool! So, what

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I would like you to do now is create another scene.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Create a whole new blank scene, save it as

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Level_02, put it in the

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
correct folder. Put it in here in the _Scenes Folder.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then, drag in one of each

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
of all of the prefabs, and you might want to

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
just move your bricks, so they are not on top of each other.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
OK, so go ahead and create that second scene

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
right now.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Cool!

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So, the way I'm doing that is I'm just going File, New Scene.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It'll say do I want to save Level_01? Well, yes I do!

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What do I want to call the new scene? Well, it hasn't asked,

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
because I haven't tried to save it. So, when I save scene,

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
it will be untitled at the top

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
here and here. You can see that

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
it's currently untitled. I'm going to call it Level_02. I'm going to put it

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
into _Scenes

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and save it. Now, we've got a blank scene. All it's got in

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
it is a camera. We can delete that camera, because we

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
have a prefabbed camera. Let's take all of the objects.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now as a hint, if you drop them straight into the Hierarchy,

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
rather than onto the scene like this, then they're going to

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
maintain their default positions. Let's see what happens! Ooh,

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that's pretty cool! I'm going to move the Main Camera

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
up, I'm going to move the Paddle down,

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and the Ball on top of it and maybe the LevelManager

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
up. OK

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
fine! So, that's absolutely fantastic! I'm going to create myself a

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
new empty GameObject called

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bricks

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and just pop my bricks in it. So, nicely reorganized

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
scene here! Now, the beauty is watch this!

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Just firstly let me spread my bricks out, like I suggested that you do.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's move them around a little bit, holding down Control

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
as I do, so that they snap to grid. Click play.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It nearly works!

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You can nearly just play your game. Now,

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
what's happening is that your ball is not responding properly.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why is that? Well, if we stop

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
we can actually see a hint at the bottom here,

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
"Object reference not set to an instance of an object"

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
in ball 19. So, what's

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
going on there? We could load the script,

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
or we could look at the ball. Either way, let's

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
wait for the script to load.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ball 19, this.transform

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
.position = paddle

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
.transform. Ah, so we publicly expose Paddle

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and something is going wrong with paddle, probably.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's take a look! The Ball is

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
asking for a Paddle and there is none. OK, so you need to drag the

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Paddle onto the Ball. Now, that's a hassle to

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
do that every time you want to make

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
a new level. And you may think that why don't you

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
maybe go to the Ball Prefab and drag the Paddle

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Prefab onto the Ball.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, you can try that. We could delete our Ball and

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Paddle and see if it has worked. Unfortunately, that just

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
makes it worse, in a way, because the error. You still have

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
the problem but it's harder to see. Let's see it now.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We've still got the problem, but now if you look at the Ball,

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
it appears to have a Paddle attached. Unfortunately,

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
what it has attached is the Paddle Prefab, not this

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
instance of the Paddle. So, you would still need to

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
re-drag the Paddle. We're going to look at sorting that out in a subsequent

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
video, so don't worry about that for now. For this level just

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
do drag your Paddle instance onto your Ball.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
so that we get into a situation where we can bounce like this.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But look, this is great news! We have done a fantastic

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
job of creating a new level, very very easily from

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
our previous assets. Just to finish off this new level,

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
let's change the Background image. So, go to your Play

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Space Background, go and find the Background

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
image in your Finder,

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in your assets that we give you, or just go and get one off the web.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've got one here. I'm going to drag it into Sprites,

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and then, once it's

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
in the Sprites, I'm going to set the Background

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
here to that.

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And then, we need to make

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
sure that the size and shape of that Background image is right.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You see how it's come in and it's just sitting down on the bottom left here.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So, if we look at our Level_01 Background image, it's got

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
a Pixels Per Unit of 50 and a Pivot of Bottom

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Left. Whereas this other one has a Pixels Per Unit of 100, so

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
it's half the size, so we sort that out. And

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the Pivot is off as well, which is why it's down there.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If we set those the same as the Levl_01 Background, ah

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
how we're talking! You see, that looks just fine!

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Great! So, we have a different level with a different

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
set of background

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
image. And I'm just going to, while I'm here,

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
move the blocks around a little bit, just so that they kind of are in

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
sympathy with the Background image.

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Just something like that. OK, and

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
there you go! We have another level, which is also playable!
