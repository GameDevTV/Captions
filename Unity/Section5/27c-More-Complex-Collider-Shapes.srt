00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello hello. guys and girls!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So. in our game. we're doing really nicely.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There's something we could improve; there's not a lot of control

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
over the bounce of the ball. at the moment. because our

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
paddle is currently flat on the top surface.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So. what I want to talk to you about. in this lecture.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is what is a

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Polygon Collider? How it could help us improve our game.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
how to manipulate Polygon Colliders.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then. I'm going to challenge you to chamfer your paddle. [Laughs]

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let me show you what I mean. So. if we

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
double click on Paddle. for example. in Level 1 in my case.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or click on it and push the F Key

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
for Frame. I sometimes say focus

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but it's really Frame. You have to do this in Scene View.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Then. you will see the collider. very very faint

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
green outline. You can just see it if you

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
turn it on and off. Well. there's a Box Collider.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
there's not a huge amount we can do when we edit it. We can make it

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
a little wider. taller. but we can't make it a different

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
shape. So. what I'm going to do and I'd like you to do is. go

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
into the Inspector for your paddle. but not in

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a particular scene actually but as a prefab

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
of course. because you want to change your paddle everywhere. So. go

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
into your paddle. and what I want you to do

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in your Paddle Prefab is. remove the Box

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Collider all together. Scary!

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And add yourself a new collider. so you can search for collider

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and you'll find a Polygon Collider 2D.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That's what we want to add. OK.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now. if we edit that Polygon Collider 2D.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
let's have a look at see what we get.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Click back on the Paddle.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Just make sure you can see the green outline. it's very very

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
faint. it's almost invisible. And once you're sure you've

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
got the right thing. click Edit. Now.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
it's still a box. but if you just

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
click the mouse and drag. you can now add

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
more lines to your polygon. Pretty cool hey! So

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I can add a line out here. for example. and this is what I mean

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
by chamfering. Again. I can click on the other side and drag

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
out. So. I want us to modify our paddles

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to look something like this. Now. if you make a mistake and you add

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
too many polygons. never fear. you can

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
always go back into the

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Paddle. click back into Edit Collider.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and then. hold down the Control Key.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so that the segment goes red. and then. click and it will

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
remove that node.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Cool! So. I'm just going to quickly show you what would happen if we had these

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
invisible colliders now. like that.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's difficult to see. but

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you'll get to a situation where you can

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
bounce the ball differently. you've got more control over it. Let

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
me see if I can make it happen. Come on you.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I think it happened there! There you go and there!

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But of course it's a little useless. because we can't see what we're doing.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So. here's your challenge then. What I want you to do

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is create a new sprite. a new paddle

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
sprite. I would create an entirely separate

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
sprite sheet for that. with just a paddle in it.

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
with chamfered edges. so draw some chamfered edges somehow.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Adjust the collider. as I've just shown

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
you. to match that new sprite.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Then. I want you to ensure that the paddle is constrained properly

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to the walls. because you're probably going to be making

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
your paddle wider. by doing this. I think it's a good idea to make it

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
wider. but we don't want it passing through the walls. so go

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and find out where that constraint happens

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and make the required change.

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Then. check it all by play testing. So go

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
ahead. pause the video. and do that now.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Cool! Well. hopefully

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
you've got on well; I'm going to show you how I plan to do it.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So. looking at my sprites. I have a single

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
brick sprite sheet here. so I'm going to need to start with that.

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I think. So. let me go and reveal that in my

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Finder. I'm going to open it with my

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
program of choice. which is Picsend. at the moment.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Fine now. that's a starting

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
point. I think I'm going to immediately save this as

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
something else. before I start messing with it.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and I'm just going to call it paddle and it's a

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
.png. which is good it supports tnasparencey.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Great! Now. it's the wrong size and shape all together.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
so let me make my window a little bigger and

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
start messing with this guy. So. first thing I'm going to do

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is change the Canvas size.

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It's 128 wide. I'm going to roll with 200.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It doesn't matter if it's wider than it needs to be. and remember that

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
our paddle is 41 pixels high and I"m going to keep the

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
top center of the image.

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
That looks about right. Actually. I want more width.

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It's better to have more than you need. because when we cut it out in

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Unity. it's going to ignore the transparent background. So. I'm

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
going to go right up to 300.

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Fantastic! OK. so

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
we have a starting point for a chamfered paddle.

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
now what we need to do is change the shape. Excuse me.

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Alright. so how are we going to do that? Well. it's entirely

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
up to you. You can use your artistic flair to draw some

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
lines and do whatever you like. I'm going to make a really ugly modification

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
mainly so that when you do your modification.

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
you can do better than us. and then. you can show off on the

105
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
discussion boards. by making something far prettier than I

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
have in this short video. So. let me see if

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I can just make something. at least symmetrical.

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
which is nearly that.

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
You know what. I'm going to allow it to be rough

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and ready and leave it at that. I'm just going to stick myself a

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
line along the bottom here. and I better get myself a

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
a Fill Tool and some gray color

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
perhaps and start filling it in.

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Doesn't that look awful? That looks

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
perfectly awful! I think that's ideal.

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I just want to demonstrate the point. and I think that having gray sides.

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
so that you can see the modification. is just fine.

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So. I'm saving that .png file.

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
going back into Unity. and it's actually already here. paddle

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
.png. Now firstly. let's look at the World Units.

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We want it to be consistant. so this bricks sprite

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
sheet used 1 to 8 pixels

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
per unit. so let's to the same with the new paddle.

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Now. let's go straight into the Sprite Editor. It's a single

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
sprite in this case. That's fine and I'm going to

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
try. inside the Sprite Editor.

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
to make sure that the transparencies

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
are there. They are. we have checker boards; it all looks OK actually.

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
so there's nothing to do in the Sprite Editor. If I just

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Apply that. Let's now try

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
going to my Brick Prefab.

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and where it's asking for the sprite.

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
up here. instead of using the

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
0 hit sprite I'm now going to use the

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Paddle Sprite. Great! So. we have a

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
new looking paddle. and it's very clear what's going on.

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
If you then go into the Paddle Prefab. remember we must do it

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
in the prefab. so it changes it across all the levels.

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and we look at editing the Polygon Collider.

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Let's see what we get now.

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So. Paddle Prefab.

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Polygon Collider. Edit.

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Where are its current bounds? We need to be in the Scene View. which

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
we are.

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And if you

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
click on it. there you go. Now. you can see that this isn't quite

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
right. at the moment. so with a bit of fiddling

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
around. you'll get to the point where you can edit it and you can zoom in.

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And you can get your Polygon Collider

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
matching what you actually see in this

151
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
sprite. otherwise it's very strange when things bounce

152
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
off invisible objects. So

153
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
again. you can be more precise than me. if you wish.

154
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I'm going for that. and it looks about right. You can see

155
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that my Polygon Collider now is the same shape as my sprite.

156
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I'm going to apply this change to

157
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the prefab. like that.

158
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Now. what would make sense would be to go into Level 1. for example. saving

159
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
as I go and have a look at my paddle. That

160
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
looks good! Now. look at Level 2 and look at your Paddle.

161
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Again. they're all the same. Level 3 Paddle.

162
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Good! So the Paddle has changed on every level. which means we

163
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
have updated the prefab appropriately. Now. let's just play for a moment.

164
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Look the paddle

165
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
is going through the wall. You see the old extense of the

166
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
paddle are hitting the wall. so we'll deal with that in a minute. Let's just check the

167
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
bouncing for now. Actually. I'm going to do that

168
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
by bouncing off the bottom brick. so that I don't have to wait for it to

169
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
come back down again. Oh dear. there it

170
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
goes! So. this is the fun of play testing.

171
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
You've got to be accurate enough to... Ooh there it goes! Now. I've got a

172
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
lot more control over my bounce. You see that? That's pretty cool right!

173
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I like it! I like it a lot! OK so

174
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
why is the paddle passing through the walls? That's

175
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the question. Congratulations if you've already fixed it!

176
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
The reason is that. the position of the paddle is constrained in

177
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
code. and the paddle is now a different width

178
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
to what it was before. So previously.

179
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
when we moved the paddle to the left hand side of the Play

180
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Space. it had a minimum transform position. if

181
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
you look here. of 0.5. Now.

182
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
when we move the paddle to the left hand side of the Play Space.

183
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
we have a minimum transform position of

184
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
about 1.18. by the looks of it

185
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and a maximum transform position

186
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
of

187
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
in my case

188
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
about 14.8. So 1.18

189
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and 14.8.

190
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So. let's take a look. I'm just going to revert my

191
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
paddle back to the position that

192
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
it normally starts in. which is at precisely

193
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
8. in the middle. and then 0.5 in the

194
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Y. Before I forget it.

195
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I'm going to write down 1.18

196
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and 4.8

197
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
believe that was right.

198
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
14.8...

199
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
OK. so they are my figures!

200
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Now. where do you change that? Well. go to Scripts.

201
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Paddle. and if you remember

202
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the way that we constrained the Paddle was using Mathf.

203
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Clamp. We couldn't use colliders. because actually the paddle never

204
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
moves. it never has any velocity during a frame. We

205
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
just move it frame by frame. using our script.

206
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So. we use this Mathf.Clamp thing.

207
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and our previous constraints were here.

208
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And what we want to change them to is what I jotted down. 1.18 and

209
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
14.8.

210
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
In my case.

211
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that's on line 26 of Paddle.cs.

212
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
in the Mathf.Clamp.

213
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
OK now. we need to do that both in AutoPlay and

214
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
in the MoveWithMouse () method.

215
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Now. you could say is this a good

216
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
idea? Could we expose this in the Inspector?

217
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Sure! Sure you can! In fact. this may be a

218
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
good idea! Why don't you do this as a mini challenge. Expose

219
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
these two float values. the min X and

220
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
max X. as instance variables

221
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
publicly in the Inspector right now. so that your artist

222
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
could make this change in the future. Go ahead. pause the video and do that

223
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
now. Cool! So I'm

224
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
doing it like this. I'm saying public float minX.

225
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and maxX. I'm going to make

226
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
two variables at the same time.

227
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And I'm not going to initialize them here. I'm going to leave them to the

228
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Inspector. And then. I'm going

229
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to remember that it's 1.18 and 14.8 and I'm going to say

230
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
minX down here.

231
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
maxX there. and then. the same

232
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
in the other method. So. whether we're doing it with AutoPlay

233
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
or with MoveWithMouse. then we still

234
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
use the same values. Now. of course you could

235
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
say let's refactor this line out to somewhere else but

236
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
we need to draw the line somewhere. This is going to get us what we want.

237
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So now. in your Paddle Prefab. on the script.

238
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
with any

239
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
luck. we will see a minX

240
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and a maxX.

241
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Just check those against my

242
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
document. Perfect! They're also three significant figures. so that

243
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
feels right. Let's try it!

244
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Ah hah! Ah hah! Perfect!

245
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Awesome! Congratulations! So. we now have a paddle that is constrained

246
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and even an artist could change those values. So as a

247
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
recap. what we have done here is we've learned what a Polygon Collider

248
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
is. We can see how it can help us improve our game.

249
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
We've learned how to manipulate Polygon Colliders. remember using

250
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
the Control Key to delete and just

251
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
by clicking to add new nodes. And hopefully you passed

252
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
the challenge and you chamfered your paddle yourself.

253
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Cool! Enjoy the improved game play. See you soon!

=======

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello hello, guys and girls!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, in our game, we're doing really nicely.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's something we could improve; there's not a lot of control

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
over the bounce of the ball, at the moment, because our

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
paddle is currently flat on the top surface.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, what I want to talk to you about, in this lecture,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is what is a

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Polygon Collider? How it could help us improve our game,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
how to manipulate Polygon Colliders,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then, I'm going to challenge you to chamfer your paddle. [Laughs]

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let me show you what I mean. So, if we

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
double click on Paddle, for example, in Level 1 in my case,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or click on it and push the F Key

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for Frame. I sometimes say focus

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but it's really Frame. You have to do this in Scene View.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Then, you will see the collider, very very faint

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
green outline. You can just see it if you

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
turn it on and off. Well, there's a Box Collider,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
there's not a huge amount we can do when we edit it. We can make it

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
a little wider, taller, but we can't make it a different

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
shape. So, what I'm going to do and I'd like you to do is, go

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
into the Inspector for your paddle, but not in

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a particular scene actually but as a prefab

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
of course, because you want to change your paddle everywhere. So, go

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
into your paddle, and what I want you to do

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in your Paddle Prefab is, remove the Box

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Collider all together. Scary!

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And add yourself a new collider, so you can search for collider

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and you'll find a Polygon Collider 2D.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's what we want to add. OK.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now, if we edit that Polygon Collider 2D,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
let's have a look at see what we get.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Click back on the Paddle,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Just make sure you can see the green outline, it's very very

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
faint, it's almost invisible. And once you're sure you've

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
got the right thing, click Edit. Now,

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
it's still a box, but if you just

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
click the mouse and drag, you can now add

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
more lines to your polygon. Pretty cool hey! So

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can add a line out here, for example, and this is what I mean

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
by chamfering. Again, I can click on the other side and drag

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
out. So, I want us to modify our paddles

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to look something like this. Now, if you make a mistake and you add

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
too many polygons, never fear, you can

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
always go back into the

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Paddle, click back into Edit Collider,

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and then, hold down the Control Key,

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so that the segment goes red, and then, click and it will

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
remove that node.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Cool! So, I'm just going to quickly show you what would happen if we had these

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
invisible colliders now, like that.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's difficult to see, but

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you'll get to a situation where you can

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
bounce the ball differently, you've got more control over it. Let

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
me see if I can make it happen. Come on you.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think it happened there! There you go and there!

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But of course it's a little useless, because we can't see what we're doing.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, here's your challenge then. What I want you to do

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
is create a new sprite, a new paddle

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
sprite. I would create an entirely separate

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
sprite sheet for that, with just a paddle in it,

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
with chamfered edges, so draw some chamfered edges somehow.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Adjust the collider, as I've just shown

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
you, to match that new sprite.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Then, I want you to ensure that the paddle is constrained properly

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to the walls, because you're probably going to be making

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
your paddle wider, by doing this. I think it's a good idea to make it

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
wider, but we don't want it passing through the walls, so go

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and find out where that constraint happens

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and make the required change.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Then, check it all by play testing. So go

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ahead, pause the video, and do that now.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Cool! Well, hopefully

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you've got on well; I'm going to show you how I plan to do it.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, looking at my sprites, I have a single

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
brick sprite sheet here, so I'm going to need to start with that,

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think. So, let me go and reveal that in my

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Finder. I'm going to open it with my

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
program of choice, which is Picsend, at the moment.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Fine now, that's a starting

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
point. I think I'm going to immediately save this as

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
something else, before I start messing with it,

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and I'm just going to call it paddle and it's a

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
.png, which is good it supports tnasparencey.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Great! Now, it's the wrong size and shape all together,

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
so let me make my window a little bigger and

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
start messing with this guy. So, first thing I'm going to do

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
is change the Canvas size.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's 128 wide, I'm going to roll with 200.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It doesn't matter if it's wider than it needs to be, and remember that

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
our paddle is 41 pixels high and I"m going to keep the

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
top center of the image.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That looks about right. Actually, I want more width.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's better to have more than you need, because when we cut it out in

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Unity, it's going to ignore the transparent background. So, I'm

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
going to go right up to 300.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Fantastic! OK, so

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
we have a starting point for a chamfered paddle,

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
now what we need to do is change the shape. Excuse me.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Alright, so how are we going to do that? Well, it's entirely

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
up to you. You can use your artistic flair to draw some

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
lines and do whatever you like. I'm going to make a really ugly modification

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
mainly so that when you do your modification,

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you can do better than us, and then, you can show off on the

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
discussion boards, by making something far prettier than I

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
have in this short video. So, let me see if

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I can just make something, at least symmetrical,

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
which is nearly that.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You know what, I'm going to allow it to be rough

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and ready and leave it at that. I'm just going to stick myself a

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
line along the bottom here, and I better get myself a

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
a Fill Tool and some gray color

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
perhaps and start filling it in.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Doesn't that look awful? That looks

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
perfectly awful! I think that's ideal.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I just want to demonstrate the point, and I think that having gray sides,

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
so that you can see the modification, is just fine.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, I'm saving that .png file,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
going back into Unity, and it's actually already here, paddle

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
.png. Now firstly, let's look at the World Units.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We want it to be consistant, so this bricks sprite

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
sheet used 1 to 8 pixels

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
per unit, so let's to the same with the new paddle.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now, let's go straight into the Sprite Editor. It's a single

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
sprite in this case. That's fine and I'm going to

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
try, inside the Sprite Editor,

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to make sure that the transparencies

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
are there. They are, we have checker boards; it all looks OK actually,

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
so there's nothing to do in the Sprite Editor. If I just

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Apply that. Let's now try

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
going to my Brick Prefab,

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and where it's asking for the sprite,

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
up here, instead of using the

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
0 hit sprite I'm now going to use the

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Paddle Sprite. Great! So, we have a

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
new looking paddle, and it's very clear what's going on.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If you then go into the Paddle Prefab, remember we must do it

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
in the prefab, so it changes it across all the levels,

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and we look at editing the Polygon Collider.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's see what we get now.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So, Paddle Prefab,

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Polygon Collider, Edit.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Where are its current bounds? We need to be in the Scene View, which

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
we are.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And if you

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
click on it, there you go. Now, you can see that this isn't quite

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
right, at the moment, so with a bit of fiddling

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
around, you'll get to the point where you can edit it and you can zoom in.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And you can get your Polygon Collider

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
matching what you actually see in this

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
sprite, otherwise it's very strange when things bounce

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
off invisible objects. So

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
again, you can be more precise than me, if you wish.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going for that, and it looks about right. You can see

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
that my Polygon Collider now is the same shape as my sprite.

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm going to apply this change to

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the prefab, like that.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now, what would make sense would be to go into Level 1, for example, saving

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
as I go and have a look at my paddle. That

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
looks good! Now, look at Level 2 and look at your Paddle.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Again, they're all the same. Level 3 Paddle.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Good! So the Paddle has changed on every level, which means we

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
have updated the prefab appropriately. Now, let's just play for a moment.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Look the paddle

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
is going through the wall. You see the old extense of the

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
paddle are hitting the wall, so we'll deal with that in a minute. Let's just check the

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
bouncing for now. Actually, I'm going to do that

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
by bouncing off the bottom brick, so that I don't have to wait for it to

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
come back down again. Oh dear, there it

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
goes! So, this is the fun of play testing.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You've got to be accurate enough to... Ooh there it goes! Now, I've got a

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
lot more control over my bounce. You see that? That's pretty cool right!

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I like it! I like it a lot! OK so

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
why is the paddle passing through the walls? That's

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the question. Congratulations if you've already fixed it!

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The reason is that, the position of the paddle is constrained in

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
code, and the paddle is now a different width

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
to what it was before. So previously,

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
when we moved the paddle to the left hand side of the Play

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Space, it had a minimum transform position, if

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you look here, of 0.5. Now,

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
when we move the paddle to the left hand side of the Play Space,

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
we have a minimum transform position of

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
about 1.18, by the looks of it

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and a maximum transform position

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
of

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
in my case

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
about 14.8. So 1.18

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and 14.8.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, let's take a look. I'm just going to revert my

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
paddle back to the position that

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
it normally starts in, which is at precisely

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
8, in the middle, and then 0.5 in the

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Y. Before I forget it,

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm going to write down 1.18

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and 4.8

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
believe that was right.

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
14.8...

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
OK, so they are my figures!

200
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Now, where do you change that? Well, go to Scripts,

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Paddle, and if you remember

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the way that we constrained the Paddle was using Mathf.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Clamp. We couldn't use colliders, because actually the paddle never

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
moves, it never has any velocity during a frame. We

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
just move it frame by frame, using our script.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So, we use this Mathf.Clamp thing,

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and our previous constraints were here.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And what we want to change them to is what I jotted down, 1.18 and

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
14.8.

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
In my case,

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
that's on line 26 of Paddle.cs,

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
in the Mathf.Clamp.

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
OK now, we need to do that both in AutoPlay and

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
in the MoveWithMouse () method.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Now, you could say is this a good

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
idea? Could we expose this in the Inspector?

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sure! Sure you can! In fact, this may be a

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
good idea! Why don't you do this as a mini challenge. Expose

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
these two float values, the min X and

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
max X, as instance variables

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
publicly in the Inspector right now, so that your artist

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
could make this change in the future. Go ahead, pause the video and do that

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
now. Cool! So I'm

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
doing it like this. I'm saying public float minX,

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and maxX, I'm going to make

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
two variables at the same time.

227
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And I'm not going to initialize them here, I'm going to leave them to the

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Inspector. And then, I'm going

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
to remember that it's 1.18 and 14.8 and I'm going to say

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
minX down here.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
maxX there, and then, the same

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
in the other method. So, whether we're doing it with AutoPlay

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
or with MoveWithMouse, then we still

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
use the same values. Now, of course you could

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
say let's refactor this line out to somewhere else but

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
we need to draw the line somewhere. This is going to get us what we want.

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So now, in your Paddle Prefab, on the script,

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
with any

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
luck, we will see a minX

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and a maxX.

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Just check those against my

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
document. Perfect! They're also three significant figures, so that

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
feels right. Let's try it!

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ah hah! Ah hah! Perfect!

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Awesome! Congratulations! So, we now have a paddle that is constrained

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and even an artist could change those values. So as a

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
recap, what we have done here is we've learned what a Polygon Collider

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
is. We can see how it can help us improve our game.

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We've learned how to manipulate Polygon Colliders, remember using

250
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the Control Key to delete and just

251
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
by clicking to add new nodes. And hopefully you passed

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the challenge and you chamfered your paddle yourself.

253
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Cool! Enjoy the improved game play. See you soon!
