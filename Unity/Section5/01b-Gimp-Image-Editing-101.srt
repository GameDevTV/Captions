
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So congratulations! You now have the .png

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
file you need. Hey guys! So, in this video

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we're going to take a quick look at an image editing program, called

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Gimp. I'm going to explain what it is and how we use it.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're going to do some cropping and resizing, adjusting

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
color and exposure, a tiny bit with brushes,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and then, finally saving our .png. So, this

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is going to help you with your Block Breaker project. So

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
firstly, what is Gimp? Well, let's take a look.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you go to gimp.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
org, gimp.org like this, you'll see a page something like

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
this. Now, it is important that you go to gimp.org,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
not some other website, so if you Google for this

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then be careful, because some people have had trouble by going

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
via sites like Source Forge, in particular.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But make sure you're getting it from the source, which is

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
gimp.org. And well, you may

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
as well go ahead and get the download going now, while I tell you about it.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, I am going to find some

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
way to download it from now. This is not a

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
commercial piece of software and that's one of the benefits. It's completely

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
free, which is fantastic! One of the disadvantages

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is it's not quite as comforting, when you try and download it,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
as its main competitor, which would be Adobe Photoshop.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The problem with Adobe Photoshop, of course, is the price,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but look at Adobe's prices now. They're trying to

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
push you down a monthly rout, even if you say I just want

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Photoshop, and I want to pay in advance, it's going to be

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
200 pounds or $300, just for one year.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, in my mind that's a bit steep, and you can do

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
quite a lot, practically everything that you can do

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in Photoshop you can do in Gimp. But you're going to

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
have to A work out how to download and install it, and B

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
just get used to it being a little bit less conventional and a bit

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
harder to get used to. That's what the purpose of this video is though.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Cool! So, let's try downloading. I'm going to download Gimp from

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
.org. Now, I'm trying to get a Torrent File here, so that's

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
not very helpful, so instead I'm going to go to this link,

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and that's better, now I'm getting a .dmg file,

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
which is what I want on the Mac. Now, I can't see the Windows Down-

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
load page and on Windows it's going to look a little different, but I'm sure

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you'll get around it. You'll find an alternative link and you'll put a download recent

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
version of Gimp; at the time of recording that's version

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
2.8. You can find out more about Gimp on

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wikipedia, "wiki gimp" for example, and

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the first article that comes up will tell you about

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Gimp and about its history. It's been going a long time, it's been out

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
for what, 19 years now.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, 19 years, so

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
it's quite a thing. It's open source community driven,

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and I think it's well worth the effort. Personally, I really

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
hated it when I started using it, but I think it's well worth the effort getting

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to use it. So, we're going to download Gimp. In my case, that's going

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to take a few minutes, so I will cut to the end of that

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
download now, and I will see you in a moment. Now, if for any

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
reason you just want to get on and don't want to have to learn how to use Gimp,

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
then simply skip this video and use the

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
assets we provided, a couple of lectures ago, at the beginning of

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
this section. OK, so here I am,

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
my file has downloaded. So this is a Mac install,

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but a PC install will be your standard PC

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
install. So, I get a file, put it in my Applications,

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I Eject my Disk Image,

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
one it's finished copying I don't

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
think there will be anything different about the PC install from any other standard

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
PC package, by the way. So, obviously if you're on

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mac, this is helpful, but if you're on a PC just carry

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
on, install as usual.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
OK, quick tip. If you are on the Mac, it may not open

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
for you, because of your security settings, so when you get to

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Gimp you may get, depending on your security settings, a

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
complaint saying this is from an unknown publisher.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Here you go! "Are you sure you want to open it?" Well, you may

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
have this, it depends on your security settings. If you're really stuck,

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
go to System Preferences, and then, go to Security,

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
up here is Security and Privacy, and you should

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
have a message here saying Gimp,

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
at the requested opening or change your security setting

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to "Apps can be downloaded from: Anywhere". Anyway, that's where you need

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to go on a Mac. So, here we are, Gimp

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
has opened, but this is one of the first jarring things. Gimp is

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
open here, but what's going on? I've got

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
windows behind. So, one of the first things you're going to want to

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
do, when you're getting started, and here's the slide for getting started,

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
is: "Set Windows > Single Window

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mode." Set Windows, Single Window, so go to

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Windows and then Single Window. And that's a little bit more

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
familiar. Now, we can maximize this window and we've got something approximating

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to what we used to. Also, if you're ever unsure, we

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
can go to Edit and Undo, as in any normal program.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Alright, so we're on our way. Let's have a look at what's next!

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So next,

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
we're going to look at selecting things in Gimp. Alright, so it's going to be

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tools, Selection Tools, Rectangular.  So firstly,

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
let's find ourselves an image.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So over here, this is something like the brick wall I was using in

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the course. So, if we just save that image,

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
pop it in my Downloads for the moment,

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and then, back into Gimp. File, Open,

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
you can just go Open, and then, look for

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ben, Downloads, the Brick_wall,

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and open it. Great we've got that! So now, how are we

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
going to make a selection and chop out, so here

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Rectangular Select Tool. It's either up there or if it's not there,

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and sometimes tools are all over the place in Gimp, then you can just go to

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Tools, Selection Tools, Rectangular Select,

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
which is the R Key, in my case. Great! So then, you can

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
drag a rough region like this, that's great.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you then left drag, in the middle of the box, the region will move

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and the corners will change the size. If you want to zoom in,

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
then it's View, Zoom In, and it'll

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
show you your keyboard shortcut as well. So, I'm going to use my keyboard

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
shortcut, Shift and +, and I'm just going to get

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
roughly around one of these bricks, really quickly. So, this

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is how you select anyway, in Gimp. I'm going to do all this rather

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
rough and quite quickly, because I just want to give you the idea and the

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
tool, so that you can play with it and

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
do your own graphics in your own time. So, if you accidentally

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
add to the selection like that, as I said Control Z to undo,

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
it's not a problem. You can move around the image,

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
if you need to. Then, you can just use

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the Cursor Keys, is one of the easiest ways to do that, just to scroll

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
around and then again, you get your Rectangular Select Tool,

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
highlight an area, and if you're this zoomed in, you can

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
do it pixel perfect. There you go! So, that is the selection

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
made for you. So then,

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've showed you how to Zoom. You can move the selection by

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
dragging in the middle, resize by dragging the corners. Cool! Also,

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
if you make a real mess with your selections, you can

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
undo them by just going to Select

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
None, Select None here. Alright cool!

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So, that is how to select. Just

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
drag a rectangle and adjust a rectangle with a corner.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OK cool! So, what's next? Well, next

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we're going to want to crop something out of this image, so

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
get the selection how you want it, and then, go to Image, Crop to Selection.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, let's just do that. Image,

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Crop to Selection. There you go!

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Boom! So, now we have a cropped image. Aright, that's

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
much better. Then, what else might you want to do? Well,

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you might want to resize this image. Then, you use Image Scale

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to do that, and then, we may want to chop off

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
the longest bit. So, let's imagine we want to get this image to

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
precisely something like one hundred and twenty-

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
eight by 41 pixels. I think that's what we were aiming

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
for in the course. So,

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
let's aim for 128 by 41

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
pixels. OK so, Image,

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Scale Image. Now, when you

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
do this, have a look. Try 128,

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
44, so we're busting in the Y direction. That's good!

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
OK so, that's fine! So, we're going to need to trim

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
3 pixels off, in the Y direction, that's great. So, 128

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
by 44, you click Scale, you may need to zoom out of this.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In my case, this is Shift and minus, to do

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
the Zoom Out. If for any reason it doesn't work,

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
then just go to your

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Zoom Out here.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
OK cool! So now, how do you know what size this

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
new rectangle is going to be. Well, look at the bottom of the screen,

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
128 by 43,

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
42, 41. There you go!

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We can move it down 1 and that,

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
if I go crop again, Image,

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Crop to Selection, is precisely

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
128 by 41 pixels.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Put my mouse at the bottom right. Perfect! OK, so that's

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
good news. Now, the next thing we're going to need to do

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
is to adjust color and exposure. So,

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
how do we do that? Well again, you can look back at the slides, which are attached to the front

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
of the section, but for colors you go to Colors, Hue Saturation.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can desaturate by dragging the

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Saturation down to 0. And then,

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
when that's done, you can go to Colors, Brightness, Contrast,

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and then, you can adjust the Brightness,

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
which is the black level, B for Brightness, B for Black,

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to get the black levels where you want them. And then, the Contrast,

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
which should really be called white level, and get that where you want it.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Something like that. Alright

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
cool! And then finally, you might want to grab a brush,

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
which is over on the left here. You're going to need to find

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
where your Brush Tool comes up. If you can't find it, go

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
to Windows,

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Dockable Dialogs, and then, Tool Options

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
here. So, if you can't find your Brush Options,

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
just Windows, Dockable Dialogs, Tool Options, and you'll get

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
this thing here. Now, I'm finding that hard to see, so I'm making it bigger,

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
but if I make it a little bit bigger, you can see I can then

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
turn the size of this brush down to say 2 pixels. And

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
at this point, I can brush and change the properties and colors of my

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
brush, all I like. So, if you want to make some

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
edits, that's how you do it with a brush.

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Cool! So, how do we save this thing and get it into Unity?

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I would firstly just save it, just save

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
full stop. You save it as a .xcf

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
file, which is the Gimp default file.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This will save all the information. This

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
dialog is confusing. This thing at the bottom here is a filter

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
for what's on your screen, so that shows you what you can see,

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
whereas this select file type is an alternative way

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
of choosing the file type, and which we're

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
going by extension here, we could explicitly say .gif.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So, the simple answer is just go Save, and just hit Choose a

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Folder, hit Save. And then, that's now saved the .gif

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
file, the Gimp file rather, that you can come back

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
to and make changes to later if you want. I would then, separately

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
export this as a .png, so Export

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
As. Now, how do you do a

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
.png? Well again, this All Exported Images, don't be

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
fooled by it, it's just telling you what you're seeing, so that is just a

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
filter, for the view. You could come down here, select File Type,

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and then, find .png, if

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you wanted to. There you go! And that would work!

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Or you could leave it on the default, which is By Extension here,

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and just type .png on the end and it will

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
take the file type from the .png.
