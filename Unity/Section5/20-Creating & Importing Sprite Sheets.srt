00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey welcome back guys and girls!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So in this video. we want to give the users some feedback

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
about how broken the blocks are. So. the yellow ones

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
break immediately but the green ones you have to hit

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
more than once. but the use has no idea

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
how many times they need to hit them. So. what we're going

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to do. in this lecture particularly. is

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we are going to explain why a Sprite

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Sheet is a useful thing. the key features

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of a Sprite Sheet. We'll create the sprites'

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
partially broken blocks. and import them into Unity.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So. why is a Sprite Sheet a useful thing. and what is

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
a Sprite Sheet. Well firstly. what is a Sprite Sheet?

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's something like this. just a set of images

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that are related. for the various animation

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
states. or just states of something in your game.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here's a brick wall crumbling. in the top row.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So currently. if we look in our

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Sprites Folder. we have a Full Brick. and

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
if you click the little arrow you'll see that

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the image is called Full Brick and

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it's being treated. if you look in the Inspector. as a single

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
sprite. You see under Inspector. Sprite

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Mode. Single. and then. if you

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
pull the little drawer out. what you've got in the drawer is a single

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
sprite called Full Brick and it's actually that.

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that we're referring to in the prefabs. If I was to

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
change the name of this Full Brick

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
sprite then. over in the prefab here.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that's what would change. When we select sprite

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we're selecting the thing in the drawer. same with

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the Left Brick and same with the Right Brick. So

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
where does it make sense for the ball to possibly be a separate sprite.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in the backgrounds? The brick is so related to itself

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that there's some benefits. in terms of organization.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in having it all in

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
one Sprite Sheet. particularly when you

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
get to more complex scenarios. like you see here like

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
this bomb going off and the flames and things.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So firstly. I'm going to tidy up the

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Left and Right Brick. into a single Sprite Sheet. so that we have

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
one. and then. I'm going to challenge you to create the

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
broken block effect. your way. So. how are we going to

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
do this. Well. I'm going to find where my Full

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Brick sprite is in my File System.

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and I'm going to open it. in my case. with Pixen. P. i. x.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
e. n. That's a Mac program you can find

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
just by Googleing for Pixen. I think it's worth the

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
$10 if you're doing any Pixel art. The other

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
thing you can use. which is free and will work on Mac

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and PC is Gimp. And even

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
though we introduced Gimp earlier in the course. I don't want this course to become too

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
reliant on Gimp. so I'm going to use a different Mac program

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
called Pixen. But if you don't have a

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Mac or you prefer to use Gimp then one of our students. Okiliy

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Dokily. has very helpfully provided

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Gimp instructions. that you can see in the discussions

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
agaisnt this lecture or on the screen right now.

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
These are step by step. I've pretty much left them unedited. just as a

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
homage to Okiliy Dokily for his super helpful

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
set of instructions. The other thing you can do. of course. if you

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
think. I just want to crack on with making the game. is just go to the

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
resources of this lecture. and I've provided my

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
completed Sprite Sheet. attached to this very lecture.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So. you don't even need to bother making a Sprite Sheet for yourself.

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
if you don't want to. So. to recap. you can use

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Gimp. you can use another editor of your choice.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but whatever image editor you decide to go for. it's important

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
it supports tranparent backgrounds.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You'll see why. It's important it's easy to resize your

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Canvas. to resize the image to put more space around

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the outside of it. and ideally it would support layers as

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
well. So. let's

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
take a look. I'm. as I say. going to open my Full Brick

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in Pixen. which is my program of choice here.

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
so let's just do that.

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And the principles

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I'll show you in Pixen will apply very well to anything else that

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
you decide to use. So the mission is. and I'm going to

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
walk you through it. is to end up with all three the Full Brick. the Left

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Brick. and the Right Brick. in the same image. So.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
how big is this image? 128 wide by 41

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
high. I want to put two more bricks below it. both of

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
height 41. and I want at least one. I'm

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
going to go for two pixels of gap around. So.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
4. 8. 12. 123

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
pixels. so if I go for

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
125 I'll be about right. So. I'm going to resize

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
my canvas. leaving the current image at the top

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to 125.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
OK cool! Then. I'm going to

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
go into my other bricks. I'm going to go find my Left

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Brick. I'm going to open that in

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Pixen. I'm going to copy it

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and paste it into this image down here.

96
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Like so.

97
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And then. I'm going to go back. I'm going to find my Right Brick.

98
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I'm going to open it with Pixen.

99
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
copy it all.

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and paste it in here. Now. I can put it at the bottom.

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
which would be fine. It doesn't quite

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
look the same width. Let me just check that. I'm on different layers here.

103
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I just want to make sure that you put your things down in exactly the right

104
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
place. That's OK. these are opacities I'm playing with

105
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
we don't need to change them. So. I can put it here in the Sprite Sheet

106
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
or I could put it here. For neatness. I'm going to put it there.

107
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I've got a bit of extra space to use later. as long as you

108
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
understand what's going on. I've got three images in the

109
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
same image now. effectively. So . if I

110
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
was to then save this. and I'm going to save it as something

111
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
different. I'm going to save it as Bricks. in the

112
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
folder. in the Assets Folder. So. Block Breaker.

113
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Assets. Sprites. I'm going to call it Bricks. and

114
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm going to save it as a .png OK.

115
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because that supports transparencies in the background. Let's go

116
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
back to Unity. and if you refresh

117
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
in here. you may see bricks appear. I do

118
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
see bricks. it's also changed my original file. It doesn't matter

119
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because I'm going to delete all three of these. In fact. I'm going to boldly delete

120
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
all of the other sprites now. completely.

121
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Everything will disappear out of your scene. don't worry about it. it's very easy to

122
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
fix. Bricks. what is this? This is an

123
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
image with three sprites in it. but currently the system only sees

124
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
it as one sprite. so this is how we chop out the

125
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
sprites. Watch this! Click onto Bricks. your new image.

126
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
under the Inspector in Sprite Mode click

127
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Multiple. you're telling it there's more than one. You'll

128
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
recall that your Pixels Per Unit was 128 before

129
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and click Sprite Editor. I

130
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
actually click apply first. and then it'll apply the 128.

131
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You can do this at any time. you can do it later. Once you're

132
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
in the Sprite Editor. here you see it now. under the Slice options

133
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
at the top left. because we've left

134
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
a space around them and the background is transparent the Automatic

135
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Slice will work. Click Automatic and you'll

136
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
see some very faint borders. If you click on each part of the image.

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
you'll see it's actually recognized all three images.

138
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Now. all we need to do is name them. and I'm going to call this

139
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
one 0 hits. because it has

140
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
not been hit. I'm just going to call this one very clearly. simply

141
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
left. and I'm going to call this one right.

142
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And the final thing I'm going to do is put their pivot points at the bottom left.

143
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
because that's where they were before. OK.

144
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Cool! If  you click apply at the top here.

145
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
towards the top right. and then close this.

146
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
now look back in Unity. You have a single

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Bricks Sprite Sheet image.

148
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which is being interpreted as multiple sprites.

149
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and when you pull out the drawer. you have 0 hits. left. and right

150
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
sprite. Awesome! Now. this is how you connect stuff back

151
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
up. Go to your Prefabs and your Paddle. it's missing

152
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the sprite. so you just give it the 0 hits sprite.

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Great! Now. what else is missing?

154
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Well. the 1 hit. 2 hit. and 3 hit prefabs

155
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
are all missing sprites. so you can multi-select them

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and give them all the 0 hits sprite. Now.

157
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
we are nearly back up and running. Now. what's going wrong with that

158
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
ball. Why is the ball sitting there? Well.

159
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I don't know. but also these bricks look off. so I think it

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
has something to do with our Pivot Point. So. going back into the Sprite

161
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Editor. it seems that actually we want central pivot

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
points. So. that's the sort of error you'll get if your Pivot

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Point is wrong. It'll rotate around the wrong place.

164
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and it's offset will be wrong. So. pop back into the Sprite Editor.

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
pop the Pivot Point for all of the sprites

166
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
back to central. and now observe that the ball

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
sits nicely on the paddle and that we're back to where

168
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
we were. with one important difference. which is that we now

169
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
understand Sprite Sheets a lot better

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
than we did before. So. what do we want you to do next? Well.

171
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I want you to create the damaged bricks. I want you to add

172
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
two more sprites at the bottom. That means you're going to need to make a

173
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
little bit more space at the bottom of your image. for one more brick.

174
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I want you to add one slightly damaged looking

175
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
brick. Now. you can do that by chopping out the brick.

176
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
into the background color and/or

177
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
painting over the top of the brick with maybe a dark color

178
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
for breakage. It's up to you. let the artist

179
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
within out. You can do the

180
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
break squiggles or the break colors

181
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
on a different layer. I don't care. You can even just write

182
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
numbers on the bricks. 2. 1. whatever you like. but just

183
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
make two different brick sprites that look like

184
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
they're being damaged. One for once a brick has been hit once.

185
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and a very damaged brick that has been hit twice.

186
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Then. reimport that same Sprite Sheet. the Bricks

187
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Sprite Sheet. to include the 1 hit

188
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and 2 hit. and then. just apply those to a couple

189
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
of the prefabs and make sure they display properly. So. that's

190
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
your challenge. Go away. have a play with sprites. Improve

191
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
your Sprite Sheet. make sure you understand how it all works. and when you finish.

192
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
come back and I'll show you how I do it.

193
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
OK congrats

194
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and welcome back! I hope you managed to do it. I'm going to go ahead now

195
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and see what's going on in Pixen. Here we go. here

196
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
is my Bricks sheet.  What do I need to do? Well.

197
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
first thing I need to do is add some more pixels to the bottom.

198
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I need another 41 pixels at the bottom.

199
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
at least. so that would take me up to 166

200
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
pixels. Great! So now.

201
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I've got the space to add two more bricks in.

202
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I'm going to zoom out a little bit. I'm going to copy

203
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the top brick. Now. I'm not sure which one the is. so trial and error.

204
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I think it may be Main Layer? Nope. it's

205
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
not. Now. you of course could rename your layers

206
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
so that you don't have to mess around too much like this but

207
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
either way it doesn't really matter. I'm just going to do

208
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
a copy now. In fact. what I'm going to do. because I don't need layers is I'm

209
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
going to merge my layers together. I just don't

210
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
need layers. at this point. it's much easier without them.

211
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So. here we go! I now can

212
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
take a Select Tool. I can copy

213
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
the brick. provided I select

214
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
everything perfectly.

215
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
There we go! I think my selection is

216
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
the right size. Paste that brick down. using the

217
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Move Tool to paste my new brick.

218
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
There that's fine. and you must

219
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
have some space. some barber pole in between. and again.

220
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
paste the final one down. If I've done my sums right. it'll fit

221
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
with a little bit of space. OK. there's a slight

222
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
problem there with... Yeah something is not pasting

223
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
right. So. what's going on?

224
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
That one is good. So. you may have to fiddle

225
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
around with it. fight the editor a little bit. Great! So. I've got

226
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
now all the images I need. That's fantastic! Now.

227
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
how am I going to make these bricks look like they are broken? Well.

228
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I'm just going to do this in a very rough and ready way.

229
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Again. I'm going to merge my layers. I only need one layer.

230
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So. it's a single flat image now. and I'm just for

231
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
the partially broken one. I'm just going to take some chunks out of it like

232
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
this. Just little little little bits like

233
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
kind of missing here. and in then the background will

234
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
show through in Unity.

235
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And it doesn't really matter how it looks. This is where you could spend a long

236
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
time being very artistic with it. The other one. I'm going to take some

237
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
fairly major chunks out of. but

238
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
not break the edges of it too much.

239
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And if you want to come in with a pen. as I said. possibly on a new

240
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
layer and just

241
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
kind of squiggle on these bricks a little bit. then you

242
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
can. And this one is looking really...

243
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Well. I don't really know if you can

244
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
see. If you're not an artist. you would have to spend a lot of time to get this right.

245
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
but that's going to do. This is my 1 hit. this is my 2 hit.

246
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I'm going to save that file and go back to Unity.

247
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
My Sprite Sheet has updated. but my sprites

248
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
haven't updated properly yet. I need to reimport them. it's

249
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
actually broken my left and right sprite. So. let's go

250
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
into the Sprite Editor and get this fixed up. You can do a new

251
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
automatic trim. deleting existing.

252
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
which is fine for this small sheet.

253
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So. this one I'm just going to rename. I'm just going to start a

254
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
fresh. This is my 0 hit. This guy is

255
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
my left. this guy is my right.

256
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
this guy is my 1 hit.

257
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and this guy is my 2

258
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
hit. Now. like a good student.

259
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I'm going to check my brief to make sure that... Yes.

260
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that is what I set to call them. 1 hit and 2 hit.

261
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Fantastic! Alright. now I'm going to apply that and close.

262
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Now. look this is a cool Sprite Sheet! We have left and right

263
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and broken. We're probably not going to make much use of these left and right

264
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
sprites. It's more of an exercise in cutting and messing

265
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
around. but these 1 hit and 2 hits are certainly useful.

266
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So again. let's go fix our prefabs. We fix our paddle

267
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
by giving it a no hit sprite.

268
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We could fix our 1 hit block temporally by giving it

269
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
1 hit. Now. of course. it hasn't been hit so that's a bit strange.

270
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
but we're just testing that these

271
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
sprites work. And if I zoom in. they do

272
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
appear to. the background is showing through. Now. they look scraggy.

273
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
they don't look very good. but at least we have now two different levels

274
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
of brokenness in our sprites. Now. if you look

275
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
at them like I am. well they don't look sufficiently different.

276
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Well. I'd agree with that. Look how flexible it is!

277
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
You can go straight back into your Image Editor and say. well

278
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I haven't really got enough missing from

279
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
my 2 hit brick. So. I'm going to pull a

280
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
bit more out of this guy and say well. you know he's not

281
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
really looking decimated enough. So here

282
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
it goes. this guy is going to look a little bit worse. Now.

283
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
when I save and go back to Unity. it immediately updates. which is really cool!

284
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So. I quite like that! I think that

285
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
you can very quickly get a good idea. as to

286
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
what it's finally going to look like. every time you save it

287
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
updates. And I think that's looking

288
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
sufficiently good. Maybe the thick one needs some...

289
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Maybe the more broken brick needs some thick lines

290
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
on it. I don't know. I'm not going to embarrass myself as an artist.

291
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
too much longer here. because

292
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
you know. I just don't need to do a lot more on this brick at the moment.

293
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
But I'm just going to add a bit more kind of black breakage

294
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
in here. Try and keep it on

295
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
top of the brick. Here we go! Ah. really ugly!

296
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And there you go. you have some really ugly art! Now. this is why you want to team

297
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
up with an artist. but I'm trying to show you the programming points here.

298
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
You have much nicer looking

299
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
sprites available to you. on the web for free. if you look around. And

300
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I'm sure you've got mates who look at this and say: Yuck! I can do better!

301
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Well. let them! Let them make you a Sprite Sheet like this. and do

302
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
better! All you have to tell them is that you want your bricks

303
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
to be 41 pixels high by 128 wide

304
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and that you want them on a transparent background.

305
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
with a little bit of space. at lest one or two pixels of space around each

306
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
thing. And then. you can just import it yourself. So

307
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
cool! Congratulations! You have now achieved everything

308
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
we set out to. at the beginning. Hopefully you understand why a Sprite Sheet is

309
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
useful. the key features of it. how you create them.

310
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and how you import them. I'll see you soon!
