00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this video we're going to talk

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
about what Z depth means, we're going to

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
discuss the problem and the solution. The problem

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we'll have if we don't understand Z depth is, sprites

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
becoming semi-transparent or invisible or generally

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
misbehaving, and the solution is to look at the Z

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
position of the sprites, relative to the background.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, what is Z depth? Well, Unity is always

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
a 3D engine, even when switched to 2D.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The Z position of Sprites matters for rendering,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
even when you're in a 2D mode, like

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we are with this game. And sprites farther from the camera

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
get rendered first, and then, the

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
sprites nearer to the camera get rendered after that.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, let's just quickly look at Unity and just look at where

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm talking about with the Z depth, in a Canvas Element

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or with a standard element, you have the

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
transform and you have a Z position here. Now, because we've been dealing with

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
X and Y in 2D, you haven't been paying a lot of attention

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to the Z position, but if you were to click your 2D button off,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
then, you would notice that actually everything is a 3D

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
world. And the same goes for, for instance, your camera, which sits

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
at -10 in Z. So, what

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we need to start becoming aware of is, this Z depth.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A typical issue would be that my brick sprites

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
become semi-transparent, when the ball hits them, or my

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
paddle changes color when the ball hits it. Now, these are issues you

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
won't have come across yet in the course, but we've inserted this

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
video for you because, in our experience, these are things that

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
students farther down the course have trouble with and I want to

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
make sure you're prepared for it. So that you don't have

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
any of these issues, we want to think about the camera being

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
at -10, is its standard Z distance,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and the background is typically at Z = 0,

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
like that. Now, a badly placed

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
sprite would be on the background, at the background's

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
depth, so when you come to put your background in, in the future lectures,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and come to put a sprite in, you're going to want to bring your sprite

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
forward a little bit, like that, to maybe minus

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
5, in between the camera and the background. Now, it won't

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
appear any larger, because we're using an orthographic camera

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and there's no perspective involved, but it does mean that

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the sprite will definitely render after the background

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and on top of the background.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Another way to do exactly the same thing would be to leave the sprite where it is,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and just to move your background back. And this is my preferred

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
method, because there's going to be a lot more sprites than there are

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
background images. There will be a single background image. So, just move your

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
background back, if you have these problems by adjusting its Z depth to a

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
more positive number. And that's really all I wanted to say

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
for this video. It's as simple as that, we just need

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to become aware of Z depth, so if you have any of

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
these problems as we move forward or you miss where I change the Z depth,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
or even if I don't change the Z depth, then go ahead and do it yourself.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Experiment and make sure you understand how it works. So, good

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,833
luck and I'll see you soon!
