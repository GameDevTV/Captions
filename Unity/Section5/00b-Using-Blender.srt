00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.790
Hey guys! So. at this stage in the course
we're going to need some 2D assets. for Block

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.090
Breaker. so I've teamed up with here with
Michael my friend and 3D artist. [Michael

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.410
Says: Hey Guys!] And are making. over in another
Udemy course. the Complete Blender Creator

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.330
Course. and what we're going to be able to
do over there is make 3D models but it's not

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.019
just about making 3D models. Of course once
you've got a 3D model. you can make 2D sprites

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.269
from it. How would that happen Mikey? Well.
if you imagine a 3D model. let's grab this

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.739
here. so we've got a lovely phone here. now
you can angle it at a certain area and then

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.550
take a photo of it. and then. use that as
a sprite in your game. That's my daughter

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.329
on the screen of the phone. by the way. So.
you could get some really realistic looking

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.550
2D assets. by taking 3D assets and photographing
them effectively. from a particular direction.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
Yes. exactly! So. this is one point in this
course. where you may want to consider diving

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.850
over to Blender and learning that in parallel.
Within 2 or 3 hours of the course. you will

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.520
be able to make very basic 2D assets. for
your game. So. if you're interested in that.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.580
then it's udemy.com/blendertutorial. and of
course because you have got this far in the

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.979
course. I've put a special coupon for you.
so make good note of this. it is UnityStudentSpecial.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.259
So. udemy.com/blendertutorial and then. put

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.799
