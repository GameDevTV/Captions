1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So far. our ball is

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
falling and hitting our paddle but not

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
bouncing. So. how are we going to make it bounce? Well.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that's where physics materials come in.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Physics has an S on the end. Unity doesn't seem to realize that. as you'll

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
see. So. the physics material is used to adjust

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
friction and bouncing effects. of colliding objects.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's take a look at their documentation for it.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here we go. you see they call it "Physics Material". you'll see that in

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
various places. but this shows you something

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
about Physics Material. So. let's go to

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Unity and make this happen.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The first thing we're going to need to do is create ourselves a folder.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
called materials. Now. later we

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
may call these type of folder Physics Materials. because there are

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
other types of materials. like Rendering Materials. but for now.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
let's just call it materials for simplicity. And in there. let's

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
create a. not a Physics Material actually.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
because that would be 3D. most things are 3D

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
by default. but a 2D Physics2D

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Material. Physics2D Material. So. create one of those

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and simply call it Ball. because it's the ball's

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
material. Let's take a look at it. it's got a friction of point

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
4. Well. actually we're going to set the friction to 0. We don't want

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the ball to have any friction. What is the friction? Well.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Click the Blue Book. The Blue Book will

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
open the manual page for the Physics 2D Material.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
very helpfully. and tell you what the friction is. Coefficient friction

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for this collider. but we're not worrying about that. We're going to set that to

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
0. we don't need any friction on the ball. but what we do need is a Bounciness.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now. what's the range of Bounciness? Click on the word

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and drag left and right. you'll see we can set it between 0 and 1.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Great! If I click play now. nothing is going to happen.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Why? Well. because it's all very

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
well making the material. but we have not attached that material to the ball.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So. click on your ball. look under the Inspector.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
under the Circle Collider 2D Section. and you'll see that it's asking

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
for a material. Drag the ball on there.

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now. let's play!

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Boing. boing.

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
cool! Now look! Look how high the ball is bouncing! It's bouncing up at

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
exactly the same point every time. It has something

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
called a Coefficient of Restitution. which is the Bounciness of

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
1. that means it is perfectly bouncy.

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We're also seeing another interesting fact here.

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You see the ball is slightly interfering with the background. That's because

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the ball and the background are at exactly the same

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
depth. and they're actually perfectly coincident with each

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
other. I'd like to push the background down a little bit.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to stop that effect. before exploring

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
this bouncing a little farther. So. go back

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
into your Scene View. Now. just for a moment. click 2D for

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
me and make it 3D. and then.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
it'll spin around. I'm not sure exactly the orientation you'll have. you can

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
use the right mouse button to change. Just look. the camera

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
is over here. so if you move around. I'm

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
holding my Middle Mouse Button down now. and then. use the Right

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Mouse Button to manipulate your position. you'll get the idea

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that we have a camera over here. And then. we have a

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
background. at a Z depth of 0. and a

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
ball. also at a Z depth of 0.

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So. why don't we push the background back a little bit. just give it a Z

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
depth of just say 1 World Unit. OK. so it's

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
behind the ball now. You'll find that when we play

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
now. the ball will just look that much more clear. and it

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
won't interfere with the background so much. And that's

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
because it's now in front of the background.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Alright. so we've just pushed the background away a tiny

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
bit. so it doesn't interfere with the ball. Great! So. back

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
over in the Scene View. let's take a look at the effect of changing

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
the Bounciness now. on the ball. So.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
what is this Bounciness figure firstly? Click the Blue Book.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It'll take you back to Unity's manual page here.

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and it tells you that the Bounciness is the degree to which

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
collisions rebound from the surface. "A Value 0 indicates no

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
bounce". Whereas a value of 1 indicates a perfect bounce with no loss

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
of energy. OK. so

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
said differently. I've got a slide here that explains exactly the

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
same thing. 0 no energy

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
conserved in the collision. Well. let's see that

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
happening.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
If we set a Bounciness of 0. the game needs to be not running when you do

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
this by the way. Watch what happens.

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
No kinetic energy is conserved in that

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
collision. OK. and then the next thing it says is that a value of

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
1 means 100% of the energy is conserved in the collision.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Well. we've seen that happening. So.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
it starts off with no kinetic energy. You'll probably remember this

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
from school. It has a certain amount of gravitational

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
potential energy relative to the paddle. and then.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
as the game runs. that kinetic energy is converted

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
from the gravitational

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
potential energy and it keeps bouncing to the same height.

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So. that's what it means by. all of the energy is conserved. it'll never decay.

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the bouncing. Now. the question

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is what would happen if I set the Bounciness to 0.5?

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
If it leaves the paddle with half the

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
energy it hit. then because kinetic energy is a half M

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
V squared. it's going to be going up to

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
only 1/4 of its height.

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So. if you want it to bounce to half the height.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
you're going to need to take the square root of the height you want it to bounce to. each

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
bounce. So. if you want it to bounce to 0.5 of it's previous

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
height. you're going to need 0.707 roughly. Let's

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
try that. a Bounciness of 0.707.

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
If that math is right. then it'll bounce to about here. in the

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
middle of the guys chest. on that triangle. Let's

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
try. expecting it to bounce to here and it does.

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
You see. every time it bounces to half the height.

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
In our game. of course. we want the ball to continue bouncing

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
forever. So. we want a Bounciness of 1.

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in our case. So. don't worry about the details of

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
choosing bounciness. I just want to show you how you would

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
get in a Bounciness that you want. if you wanted to.

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Now. if you do want to know more about the physics. of course. then pop

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
over to my little face here. take a look at the other

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
courses I've got. One of them is Game Physics - Extend

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Unity 3D's Physics Engine. and in there I'm going to take you through

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
step by step. how to build your own Physics Engine.

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You'll be in a much better position to understand things

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
like how this thing bounces. how high it bounces. how

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
energy is conserved. etc. So. take a look

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
in Physics 101. It's a course I'm really passionate about. I really

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
enjoyed putting it together. and the feedback that I'm getting already is really

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
cool. Run it! So. here we go. let's try the Bounciness

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
of 1 again. and it will just keep bouncing. which

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is precisely what we want here. We want energy to be conserved

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
whenever the ball hits anything. So. congratulations!

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
We have a ball bouncing on a paddle. It's a bit more visible.

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the ball now. And I shall see you

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
shortly.

=======

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So far, our ball is

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
falling and hitting our paddle but not

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
bouncing. So, how are we going to make it bounce? Well,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that's where physics materials come in.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Physics has an S on the end, Unity doesn't seem to realize that, as you'll

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
see. So, the physics material is used to adjust

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
friction and bouncing effects, of colliding objects.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's take a look at their documentation for it.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here we go, you see they call it "Physics Material", you'll see that in

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
various places, but this shows you something

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
about Physics Material. So, let's go to

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Unity and make this happen.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The first thing we're going to need to do is create ourselves a folder,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
called materials. Now, later we

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
may call these type of folder Physics Materials, because there are

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
other types of materials, like Rendering Materials, but for now,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
let's just call it materials for simplicity. And in there, let's

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
create a, not a Physics Material actually,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
because that would be 3D, most things are 3D

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
by default, but a 2D Physics2D

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Material. Physics2D Material. So, create one of those

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and simply call it Ball, because it's the ball's

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
material. Let's take a look at it, it's got a friction of point

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
4. Well, actually we're going to set the friction to 0. We don't want

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the ball to have any friction. What is the friction? Well,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Click the Blue Book. The Blue Book will

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
open the manual page for the Physics 2D Material,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
very helpfully, and tell you what the friction is. Coefficient friction

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for this collider, but we're not worrying about that. We're going to set that to

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
0, we don't need any friction on the ball, but what we do need is a Bounciness.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now, what's the range of Bounciness? Click on the word

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and drag left and right, you'll see we can set it between 0 and 1.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Great! If I click play now, nothing is going to happen.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why? Well, because it's all very

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
well making the material, but we have not attached that material to the ball.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, click on your ball, look under the Inspector,

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
under the Circle Collider 2D Section, and you'll see that it's asking

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
for a material. Drag the ball on there.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, let's play!

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Boing, boing,

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
cool! Now look! Look how high the ball is bouncing! It's bouncing up at

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
exactly the same point every time. It has something

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
called a Coefficient of Restitution, which is the Bounciness of

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
1, that means it is perfectly bouncy.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We're also seeing another interesting fact here.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You see the ball is slightly interfering with the background. That's because

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the ball and the background are at exactly the same

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
depth, and they're actually perfectly coincident with each

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
other. I'd like to push the background down a little bit,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to stop that effect, before exploring

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
this bouncing a little farther. So, go back

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
into your Scene View. Now, just for a moment, click 2D for

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
me and make it 3D, and then,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
it'll spin around. I'm not sure exactly the orientation you'll have, you can

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
use the right mouse button to change. Just look, the camera

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
is over here, so if you move around, I'm

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
holding my Middle Mouse Button down now, and then, use the Right

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mouse Button to manipulate your position, you'll get the idea

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that we have a camera over here. And then, we have a

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
background, at a Z depth of 0, and a

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ball, also at a Z depth of 0.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, why don't we push the background back a little bit, just give it a Z

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
depth of just say 1 World Unit. OK, so it's

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
behind the ball now. You'll find that when we play

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
now, the ball will just look that much more clear, and it

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
won't interfere with the background so much. And that's

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
because it's now in front of the background.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Alright, so we've just pushed the background away a tiny

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
bit, so it doesn't interfere with the ball. Great! So, back

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
over in the Scene View, let's take a look at the effect of changing

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the Bounciness now, on the ball. So,

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
what is this Bounciness figure firstly? Click the Blue Book.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It'll take you back to Unity's manual page here,

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and it tells you that the Bounciness is the degree to which

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
collisions rebound from the surface. "A Value 0 indicates no

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
bounce". Whereas a value of 1 indicates a perfect bounce with no loss

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
of energy. OK, so

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
said differently, I've got a slide here that explains exactly the

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
same thing. 0 no energy

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
conserved in the collision. Well, let's see that

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
happening.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If we set a Bounciness of 0, the game needs to be not running when you do

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
this by the way. Watch what happens.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No kinetic energy is conserved in that

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
collision. OK, and then the next thing it says is that a value of

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
1 means 100% of the energy is conserved in the collision.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, we've seen that happening. So,

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
it starts off with no kinetic energy. You'll probably remember this

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
from school. It has a certain amount of gravitational

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
potential energy relative to the paddle, and then,

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
as the game runs, that kinetic energy is converted

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
from the gravitational

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
potential energy and it keeps bouncing to the same height.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, that's what it means by, all of the energy is conserved, it'll never decay,

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the bouncing. Now, the question

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is what would happen if I set the Bounciness to 0.5?

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If it leaves the paddle with half the

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
energy it hit, then because kinetic energy is a half M

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
V squared, it's going to be going up to

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
only 1/4 of its height.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, if you want it to bounce to half the height,

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you're going to need to take the square root of the height you want it to bounce to, each

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
bounce. So, if you want it to bounce to 0.5 of it's previous

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
height, you're going to need 0.707 roughly. Let's

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
try that, a Bounciness of 0.707.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If that math is right, then it'll bounce to about here, in the

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
middle of the guys chest, on that triangle. Let's

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
try, expecting it to bounce to here and it does.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You see, every time it bounces to half the height.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
In our game, of course, we want the ball to continue bouncing

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
forever. So, we want a Bounciness of 1,

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
in our case. So, don't worry about the details of

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
choosing bounciness, I just want to show you how you would

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
get in a Bounciness that you want, if you wanted to.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now, if you do want to know more about the physics, of course, then pop

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
over to my little face here, take a look at the other

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
courses I've got. One of them is Game Physics - Extend

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Unity 3D's Physics Engine, and in there I'm going to take you through

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
step by step, how to build your own Physics Engine.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You'll be in a much better position to understand things

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
like how this thing bounces, how high it bounces, how

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
energy is conserved, etc. So, take a look

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
in Physics 101. It's a course I'm really passionate about, I really

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
enjoyed putting it together, and the feedback that I'm getting already is really

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
cool. Run it! So, here we go, let's try the Bounciness

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
of 1 again, and it will just keep bouncing, which

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
is precisely what we want here. We want energy to be conserved

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
whenever the ball hits anything. So, congratulations!

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We have a ball bouncing on a paddle. It's a bit more visible,

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the ball now. And I shall see you

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
shortly.
