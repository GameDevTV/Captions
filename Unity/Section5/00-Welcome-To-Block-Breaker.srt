00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, Hi and welcome back!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this section, we're going to be building a block breaking

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
game, in the style of Arkanoid and Breakout.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, we're looking forward now to moving away from text based

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
stuff and moving into visual games, which is

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
what really this is all about. So, it's a very

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
simple breakout game, but it's actually really good fun and

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
very instructive, in how we use the Unity Editor.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, what are we actually going to be learning then? Lots of things,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
2D collisions and destroying objects, when things get

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
hit either once or many times, or you're going to be triggering

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
sound effects. Boing sounds and crack

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
sounds and that sort of thing. I encourage you to get your microphone out and make your own.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's so much more fun if you do, actually, if you make

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
crazy sound effects yourself, from recording from your mic, it's so much more

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
fun. Or use your kids, child labor

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is always good fun! I certainly use my daughter for my

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
prototype. Responding to mouse input, you'll be

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
actually responding to the mouse, for the first time.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We'll talk a little bit about automated play testing, so

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
we can check that the game is stable at high speeds.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Loads of stuff! That's actually really cool right, because

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you're creating a little piece of

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
AI that sits in your game and plays, instead of the player, and kind

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of irons out all the bugs to make sure that everything is working fine.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And it's always fun to see your game play itself. Yes exactly!

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There's something quite fun about that! You're going to be a lot more confident

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
with the Editor, operating in 2D. We're going to be putting a lot of bricks

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
together, building walls, and things.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And again, you're going to have an opportunity to create something

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
that you can be very creative with. Go ahead! Make more levels,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
add your own levels, again build them and

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
share them with the community on Udemy, and also on

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
www.completeunitydeveloper.com. Yeah, it's always fun to see

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
what levels people come up with! There's always so much cool stuff that people

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
create and we never expect. We

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
come and see these levels, that have been created by you

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
guys, and we're like, oh this is so cool! So, please do

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
create your own stuff and share it, because that's awesome! Awesome!

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, good luck, let's dive in, and get it done!
