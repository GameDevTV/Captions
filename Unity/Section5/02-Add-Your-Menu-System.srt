00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hey welcome back! So. before we dive in and start playing with blocks.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we're going to get our Menu System setup. Remember. we want

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to get in the habit of having our Menu System setup from the very

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
beginning. so that we can navigate around the

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Start Menu. the Game Screens. and then

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
onto the final Win Screen. So.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that we really set the president. we wet the standard.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we've created the structure. So. we're going to go into the

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Number Wizard UI and export the menus and

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
import them into this project. customize the words and fonts.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then. you're going to wire up the buttons. So. let's

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
take a look! I'm sitting here in my Block Breaker. that's got almost nothing

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in it. It's just got a game scene

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and some sprites. I'm going to switch over to

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Number Wizard UI. for a moment.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which is in my recent projects. when I go to open the File and Open

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Project.

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And here we are! So. what I'm going to do from here is. I'm

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
going to export a package. just like the packages you see in the Unity

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Store. And I'm going to say to myself. well what do I need? Well.

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I don't need the game. because the Number Wizard UI game is very

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
different to this game. and I don't need the Number Wizard

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Script. because we're not going to be using any of Number Wizard's

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
behavior here. But I do want the LevelManager

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and I do want the Start Screen and the Win Screen. because they're our starting

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
point for my next Menu System. so let's

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
do that. Make yourself a package somewhere.

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It doesn't matter what you call it. Menus if you like.

29
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
OK. and you get menu.unitypackage

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
here. OK fantastic! So. what are

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we going to do with that? Well. back over to

32
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
our Block Breaker project.

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Once there. we go to

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Assets and Import Package. and it's a Custom Package.

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Don't we feel clever. we've made our own custom package already.

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And we import menu.unitypackage.

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the thing we just exported.

38
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Well. we're going to import everything. because we just chose what we're going to export.

39
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So. it's literally just copying and pasting between projects. at this stage.

40
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now. we need a little tidy up. In our previous

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
project. we called scenes. scenes with an S without an underscore.

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now. look how confusing that is. Scenes. Scripts. and Sprites. That's why

43
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I prefer the underscore version . but immediately you seen an inconsistency

44
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
like that. sort it out. Take your Start and Win

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Menus. put them in your _Scenes Folder. and Delete.

46
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Oops... That's

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
better! Delete that one. Fantastic! So now. what

48
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we have is we have three scenes. Start Menu.

49
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Win Screen. and Level_01. and then. we have

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the Scripts Folder with LevelManager in it and the same sprites we had

51
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
before. Let's get to work changing these scenes. one at a time.

52
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Into your Start Menu! So. the first thing that's

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
inappropriate about this Start Menu is the fonts. We need to change

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the font. in my opinion. so let's do that first!

55
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I'm going to go to a website called

56
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
www.dafont.com a great place to get free fonts. and I'm just

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
going to search for block and see what we get.

58
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Now. scroll down and find a font that

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is readable and appropriate feeling.

60
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's entirely up to you what font you use. I'm

61
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
going to plump for the first one that looks good. I think I'm going to go for

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
BM Block here. So. download your font from

63
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
dafont. There it is. bm_block!

64
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And then. just take the .ttf file from that.

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and drop it into Unity

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Assets. Now. I'm going to

67
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
make myself a tidy immediately. by

68
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
creating a folder called Fonts and putting the bm_block font in it.

69
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Great! Now. you can select all of

70
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
your Text Elements under you Hierarchy. Start Menu.

71
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and you can hold down Shift. click on Title. and keep

72
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Shift held down. and click on the Quit button.

73
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Then. you'll be able to select all of these elements or do them one at a time.

74
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The way you change the fonts. one in the Inspector under the

75
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Text Script component where it says Font.

76
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
click the little circle and choose your

77
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
bm_block. Great! Now. it's just a question of moving

78
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
things around to see your

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
taste and changing the Font Size again.

80
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to taste. "Welcome to Number Wizard!"

81
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
If you get corruption like I've just got. play the game.

82
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and then. un-play and you'll find that it should go away.

83
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So. Start is clearly too big.

84
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Quit I'm going to make a little smaller this time. so it's a bit more balanced.

85
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
OK. how does that

86
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
look? Let's hit the play button.

87
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
OK fantastic! Now. let's change the text.

88
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Of course. you may be better changing

89
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the text before you change the Font Size; then. you won't have to keep going in

90
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
circles. Tell them what they need to do.

91
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
"Smash all the blocks to win!" If you need to resize the Text Element.

92
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
of course. click on it. This is the Subtitle. Use the UI Element

93
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Tool or the T Button on the keyboard. resize it.

94
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and then. use it's snapping ability to decentralize.

95
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
OK. let's take a look at that!

96
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Fantastic! Alright. let's give the same treatment

97
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
now to the other scene. which is the Win Scene. You'll

98
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
immediately see. oh that feels different and looks different.

99
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
OK. let's just change the font on both. so we're consistent.

100
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Great! "I guessed right" is

101
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
no longer appropriate. so let's change that! "You

102
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
beat Block Breaker"

103
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Get the font right .and then our

104
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
play button. again it's too big. "Play Again"

105
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
but that's looking about right.

106
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We can move elements around. if we want to.

107
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
OK. let's play and see! "You beat Block Breaker"

108
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
OK fantastic! Now.

109
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
we have achieved most of our objectives! What I want you to do now

110
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is to wire up these buttons. as a challenge. so that

111
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
they work. So. let's just dive into the presentation.

112
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Here! Get the Start button to go to Level_01.

113
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Add a temporary "Game Over"

114
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
button to Level_01. so that when we click it that

115
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Game Over Button goes to the Win Screen.

116
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Then. change the "Play Again" button to go back to

117
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the Start Menu. So. you'll be able to navigate from the

118
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Start Scene into a Game Screen. which will just be a blue background

119
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
with nothing in it. where you can click "Game Over".

120
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And you'll go over to the Win Screen. and then. on the Win Screen you can click Play Again.

121
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to restart the whole thing. and test that you can navigate fully. So.

122
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
pause the video and go ahead and get yourself confident

123
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
doing that now.

124
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Awesome and welcome back! So. let's

125
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
take a look at how we're going to do this.

126
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Hopefully you've already done it. Are you doing the challenges or are you just waiting for me to show you?

127
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I hope you're doing the challenges. [Laughs] So. let's click on the Start Button.

128
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
What's wrong with it's script? Well. down at the bottom here.

129
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
under the button script on the OnClick event. we're going

130
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to the Game Scene. There is no Game Scene in this game. and we have Level_01.

131
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
so that should fix the Start Button.

132
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Let's try it! Start!

133
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
OK. Level_01 could not be loaded. because it's not been

134
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
added to the Build Settings. That's just fine and expected. Let's go to the

135
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Build Settings. Let's get all of your scenes

136
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
visible and drag all of them into the Build Settings. and then.

137
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
set the order to be logical. i.e. Start Menu comes first.

138
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You may have to click. it's a bit

139
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
awkward. There you go! Start Menu to Level_01 to Win Screen.

140
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Fantastic! You don't need to build. You can just exit the Build

141
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Settings. but now. when you come to run this you should

142
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
find that. when you click Start. it goes to the Level_01. which is

143
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
fantastic! And also. when you click Quite. nothing

144
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
will happen. but you will get a log down here on the bottom left saying "Quit

145
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
requested". Fantastic! So. the other scene you needed to modify was

146
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
your Win Scene. Saving as we go! Play again!

147
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It should simply go to the Start Menu.

148
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
so actually by the looks of it you don't need to do anything.

149
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It already works. Start! OK

150
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
fantastic! Now. the final thing you need to do is. on Level_01.

151
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I said we needed a button that is going to allow us

152
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
to transition onto

153
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
the Win Screen. So. how are we going to do that? Well.

154
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I'm going to create a UI Element.

155
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and I'm going to make it a button.

156
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
What is this type of Canvas? Let's take a look! It's a Screen

157
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Space Overlay. so it's going to cross the entire screen. That's OK!

158
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And then. for now. we can just have a very ugly button somewhere. Where

159
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
shall I stick it? Bottom right. say for now. Let's just call it

160
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Game Over.

161
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So. once you've named the text on your button.

162
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
go back to the Button itself. under Hierarchy. Canvas. and

163
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
then Button. And we're going to need to

164
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
deal with the OnClick even. Now. the way

165
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that the other scenes. let's take a look at say the Win Screen.

166
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
The way that they deal with that. let's look at this button. this Play Again

167
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Button. What you have here is you

168
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
have a LevelManager passed in. you see. and then. it uses LevelManager

169
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
.LoadLevel. So. what we're missing is a LevelManager on

170
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
our Level_01 scene. So. let's put it on! Copy LevelManager

171
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
from here. that's one way of doing it. or you could recreate it.

172
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Look. what is it at the end of the day? It's just a thing with a Level

173
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Manager Script against it.

174
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Paste into your Hierarchy

175
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
there. So. we now have a LevelManager in this scene.

176
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Back to our Game Over Button. We can now

177
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
drag the Level Manager onto

178
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
the Game Over Button's OnClick event.

179
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Now. we'll be able to choose LevelManager.LoadLevel

180
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and we can call it Win Screen! Fantastic!

181
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Just time to test! Let's click play! Game Over takes

182
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
us to there. "You beat Block Breaker". Great! Play Again!

183
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
We could Quit! We'll just expect to get a quit request

184
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
logged! You click Start. you go to a very basic and ugly

185
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Game Screen. you click Game Over. Fantastic! Our Menu

186
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
System is functioning and customized to look like

187
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Block Breaker. Congratulations! See you soon!

=======

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey welcome back! So, before we dive in and start playing with blocks,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we're going to get our Menu System setup. Remember, we want

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to get in the habit of having our Menu System setup from the very

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
beginning, so that we can navigate around the

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Start Menu, the Game Screens, and then

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
onto the final Win Screen. So,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that we really set the president, we wet the standard,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and we've created the structure. So, we're going to go into the

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Number Wizard UI and export the menus and

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
import them into this project, customize the words and fonts,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and then, you're going to wire up the buttons. So, let's

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
take a look! I'm sitting here in my Block Breaker, that's got almost nothing

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
in it. It's just got a game scene

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and some sprites. I'm going to switch over to

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Number Wizard UI, for a moment,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
which is in my recent projects, when I go to open the File and Open

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Project.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And here we are! So, what I'm going to do from here is, I'm

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
going to export a package, just like the packages you see in the Unity

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Store. And I'm going to say to myself, well what do I need? Well,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't need the game, because the Number Wizard UI game is very

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
different to this game, and I don't need the Number Wizard

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Script, because we're not going to be using any of Number Wizard's

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
behavior here. But I do want the LevelManager

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and I do want the Start Screen and the Win Screen, because they're our starting

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
point for my next Menu System, so let's

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
do that. Make yourself a package somewhere.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It doesn't matter what you call it, Menus if you like.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
OK, and you get menu.unitypackage

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
here. OK fantastic! So, what are

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
we going to do with that? Well, back over to

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
our Block Breaker project.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Once there, we go to

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Assets and Import Package, and it's a Custom Package.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't we feel clever, we've made our own custom package already.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And we import menu.unitypackage,

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
the thing we just exported.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, we're going to import everything, because we just chose what we're going to export.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, it's literally just copying and pasting between projects, at this stage.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now, we need a little tidy up. In our previous

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
project, we called scenes, scenes with an S without an underscore.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now, look how confusing that is, Scenes, Scripts, and Sprites. That's why

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I prefer the underscore version , but immediately you seen an inconsistency

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
like that, sort it out. Take your Start and Win

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Menus, put them in your _Scenes Folder, and Delete.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oops... That's

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
better! Delete that one. Fantastic! So now, what

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
we have is we have three scenes, Start Menu,

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Win Screen, and Level_01, and then, we have

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the Scripts Folder with LevelManager in it and the same sprites we had

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
before. Let's get to work changing these scenes, one at a time.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Into your Start Menu! So, the first thing that's

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
inappropriate about this Start Menu is the fonts. We need to change

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the font, in my opinion, so let's do that first!

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going to go to a website called

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
www.dafont.com a great place to get free fonts, and I'm just

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
going to search for block and see what we get.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now, scroll down and find a font that

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
is readable and appropriate feeling.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's entirely up to you what font you use. I'm

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
going to plump for the first one that looks good. I think I'm going to go for

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
BM Block here. So, download your font from

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
dafont. There it is, bm_block!

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And then, just take the .ttf file from that,

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and drop it into Unity

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Assets. Now, I'm going to

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
make myself a tidy immediately, by

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
creating a folder called Fonts and putting the bm_block font in it.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Great! Now, you can select all of

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
your Text Elements under you Hierarchy, Start Menu,

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and you can hold down Shift, click on Title, and keep

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Shift held down, and click on the Quit button.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then, you'll be able to select all of these elements or do them one at a time.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The way you change the fonts, one in the Inspector under the

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Text Script component where it says Font,

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
click the little circle and choose your

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
bm_block. Great! Now, it's just a question of moving

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
things around to see your

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
taste and changing the Font Size again,

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to taste. "Welcome to Number Wizard!"

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you get corruption like I've just got, play the game,

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and then, un-play and you'll find that it should go away.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, Start is clearly too big.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Quit I'm going to make a little smaller this time, so it's a bit more balanced.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OK, how does that

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
look? Let's hit the play button.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OK fantastic! Now, let's change the text.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Of course, you may be better changing

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the text before you change the Font Size; then, you won't have to keep going in

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
circles. Tell them what they need to do.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
"Smash all the blocks to win!" If you need to resize the Text Element,

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
of course, click on it. This is the Subtitle. Use the UI Element

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Tool or the T Button on the keyboard, resize it,

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and then, use it's snapping ability to decentralize.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
OK, let's take a look at that!

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Fantastic! Alright, let's give the same treatment

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
now to the other scene, which is the Win Scene. You'll

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
immediately see, oh that feels different and looks different.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
OK, let's just change the font on both, so we're consistent.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Great! "I guessed right" is

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
no longer appropriate, so let's change that! "You

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
beat Block Breaker"

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Get the font right ,and then our

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
play button, again it's too big. "Play Again"

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
but that's looking about right.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We can move elements around, if we want to.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
OK, let's play and see! "You beat Block Breaker"

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
OK fantastic! Now,

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
we have achieved most of our objectives! What I want you to do now

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is to wire up these buttons, as a challenge, so that

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
they work. So, let's just dive into the presentation.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Here! Get the Start button to go to Level_01.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Add a temporary "Game Over"

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
button to Level_01, so that when we click it that

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Game Over Button goes to the Win Screen.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then, change the "Play Again" button to go back to

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the Start Menu. So, you'll be able to navigate from the

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Start Scene into a Game Screen, which will just be a blue background

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
with nothing in it, where you can click "Game Over".

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And you'll go over to the Win Screen, and then, on the Win Screen you can click Play Again,

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to restart the whole thing, and test that you can navigate fully. So,

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
pause the video and go ahead and get yourself confident

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
doing that now.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Awesome and welcome back! So, let's

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
take a look at how we're going to do this.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hopefully you've already done it. Are you doing the challenges or are you just waiting for me to show you?

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I hope you're doing the challenges. [Laughs] So, let's click on the Start Button.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What's wrong with it's script? Well, down at the bottom here,

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
under the button script on the OnClick event, we're going

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to the Game Scene. There is no Game Scene in this game, and we have Level_01,

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
so that should fix the Start Button.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's try it! Start!

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
OK, Level_01 could not be loaded, because it's not been

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
added to the Build Settings. That's just fine and expected. Let's go to the

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Build Settings. Let's get all of your scenes

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
visible and drag all of them into the Build Settings, and then,

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
set the order to be logical, i.e. Start Menu comes first.

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You may have to click, it's a bit

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
awkward. There you go! Start Menu to Level_01 to Win Screen.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fantastic! You don't need to build. You can just exit the Build

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Settings, but now, when you come to run this you should

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
find that, when you click Start, it goes to the Level_01, which is

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
fantastic! And also, when you click Quite, nothing

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
will happen, but you will get a log down here on the bottom left saying "Quit

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
requested". Fantastic! So, the other scene you needed to modify was

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
your Win Scene. Saving as we go! Play again!

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It should simply go to the Start Menu,

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
so actually by the looks of it you don't need to do anything,

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It already works. Start! OK

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
fantastic! Now, the final thing you need to do is, on Level_01,

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I said we needed a button that is going to allow us

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
to transition onto

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
the Win Screen. So, how are we going to do that? Well,

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm going to create a UI Element,

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and I'm going to make it a button.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What is this type of Canvas? Let's take a look! It's a Screen

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Space Overlay, so it's going to cross the entire screen. That's OK!

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And then, for now, we can just have a very ugly button somewhere. Where

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
shall I stick it? Bottom right, say for now. Let's just call it

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Game Over.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So, once you've named the text on your button,

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
go back to the Button itself, under Hierarchy, Canvas, and

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
then Button. And we're going to need to

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
deal with the OnClick even. Now, the way

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that the other scenes, let's take a look at say the Win Screen.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The way that they deal with that, let's look at this button, this Play Again

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Button. What you have here is you

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
have a LevelManager passed in, you see, and then, it uses LevelManager

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
.LoadLevel. So, what we're missing is a LevelManager on

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
our Level_01 scene. So, let's put it on! Copy LevelManager

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
from here, that's one way of doing it, or you could recreate it.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Look, what is it at the end of the day? It's just a thing with a Level

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Manager Script against it.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Paste into your Hierarchy

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
there. So, we now have a LevelManager in this scene.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Back to our Game Over Button. We can now

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
drag the Level Manager onto

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the Game Over Button's OnClick event.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Now, we'll be able to choose LevelManager.LoadLevel

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and we can call it Win Screen! Fantastic!

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Just time to test! Let's click play! Game Over takes

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
us to there. "You beat Block Breaker". Great! Play Again!

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We could Quit! We'll just expect to get a quit request

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
logged! You click Start, you go to a very basic and ugly

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Game Screen, you click Game Over. Fantastic! Our Menu

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
System is functioning and customized to look like

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Block Breaker. Congratulations! See you soon!
