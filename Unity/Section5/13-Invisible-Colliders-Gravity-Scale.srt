00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey welcome back! So. we have

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
our ball physics sorted. We have our

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
ball firing off the bat. when we click the button. and

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it's even bouncing off the bat. So. we now need

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to get the side walls and the top wall sorted out

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and to adjust up the speed so that the ball actually

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
has a chance of hitting the top wall. Cool! So.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
how are we going to do that? Well. we could

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
build some walls out of bricks. In fact. I went down that root

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with this project. and it's

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a slippery slope. because once you start trying to build the wall out of bricks.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
well I certainly very quickly wanted to

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
think about how to do it with a program

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and that gets a bit technical for this stage in the course. So.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
if you're really interested in how to build a brick wall with a program.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
ask me in the discussions and I will consider putting

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it in as a bonus video. But for now. we're just going

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to use invisible colliders and use the background

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
as the visual

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
cue. as to where the play space ends.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Firstly. I'm going to turn off my Grid Gizmo. because

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I don't need to see that grid. That's clearer! And now.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm going to create my first collider.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Before I do that. I'm going to make an organizing GameObject called Play

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Space.

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm fighting the Caps Lock Key and my fingers!

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
At last. woo hoo! I typed it

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
right! OK. Play Space. Reset the Transform.

29
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And now. I'm going to put it near the top. and I'm going to put

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the background into it. OK fantastic!

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's just for organization! Now. when I create the next empty Game

32
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Object. I'm going to call it Left Wall.

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
There it is! OK now.

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
what is the Left Wall? It's nothing but a transform in the middle of the screen

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
right now. Not a lot of use. OK

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
so. what are we going to do with it? Well. I think I'm going to Reset it to the

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
origin. down here. and I'm going to add to it

38
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
a Box Collider 2D.

39
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And now. I want to... I'm going to keep its origin

40
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
here. actually. but I want it to extend off to the left and

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
up to the top. So. it needs to have a Y size

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
of the height of our play space. which is

43
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
what? It's 16. I think it was 10

44
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
wasn't it? Let's take a look!

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It looks like it's 12. the height of our play space. So.

46
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we make our collider have a height of 12 and

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that's all very well. but now. if you want the pivot

48
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of this collider to be here. then you're going to

49
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
have to play around with the offsets. so let's do that!

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Let's make the Center at X equals

51
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
<v ->0.5.</v>

52
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and that's about right

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
there! Perfect! And the Y Center at

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
<v ->6 let's try that or +6.</v>

55
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
+6 great! Now. let's Reset it!

56
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You get the idea! The combination of the Center and the

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Size tells you how this collider sits.

58
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It frankly really doesn't matter where it's transform

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is. but I think that's a logical place for it to be.

60
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
OK fantastic! So. what I'd like

61
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
you to do now. as an exercise. is setup

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the other two colliders. I'd like you to put a Top Collider

63
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
along here. and a Right Wall Collider

64
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
on the right hand side. which should be a mirror image of this one.

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I don't mind how you do your Top Collider. as long as there are no

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
gaps. So. just to be

67
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
clear. I want you to pause the video and add a couple of colliders.

68
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
at the same width of the one I've done. which is 1 for the moment.

69
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And ensure there are no spaces anywhere that the ball

70
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
could get out and test it by playing. So. pause

71
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the video and do that now please.

72
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Cool! Welcome back! So. the Right Wall I'm going to do by

73
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
duplicating the Left Wall. firstly.

74
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Right Wall. hit Return.

75
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and then. I'm going to move it across.

76
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Now. the Left Wall is still there. don't worry. you just can't see it once you move

77
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the Right Wall. And I wanted a position

78
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
of 17. by the looks of it. depending on where I put my origin.

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And then. it looks like the Center is going to be + 0.5.

80
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
in this case. and 16. OK!

81
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Well. that's logical because the Left Wall is at 0 and the Right

82
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Wall is at 16.0. I like that!

83
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Where would it make sense for the Top Wall's origin to be? Well. I

84
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
think in the middle maybe? It doesn't really matter. so let's

85
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
duplicate the Right Wall. Now. we

86
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
need to change it's Size. I'm going to go for a width of

87
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
16 and a height of 1. Perfect!

88
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm going to call it a Top Wall.

89
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
OK. I'm going to Reset the Centers.

90
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
for the moment. just so I can get some sanity on where it is.

91
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
0. 0. Move

92
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
it up. OK. let's take the Y

93
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Center down to +0.5. Note: It is +0.5.

94
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
OK.

95
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that's fine! And then. I'm going to move the wall down

96
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to precisely 12.

97
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Oh dear. excuse me!

98
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The problem is. I've got the microphone between my face and the

99
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
keyboard. so I can't see my fingers half the time. And

100
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
an X Position of 8. Ah. that makes sense! So.

101
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the Left Wall is at 0. 0. It doesn't

102
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
really matter where it's transform is. but it looks right crucially.

103
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm going to put the Top Wall in the middle. just

104
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
because I'm being OCD. The Top Wall is at 8.

105
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
12. It's in the middle at the top. that kind of makes sense.

106
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and then. the Right Wall is on the Right Hand side. Awesome! So. they

107
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are all colliders.

108
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Now. are we safe here if I select all of them? Do we think that

109
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
the corner is good enough? Or do we want to make our Top Wall.

110
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
instead of 16 wide maybe we make it 18 wide.

111
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
like that. and then it overlaps completely? Oh. that

112
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
feels safe as houses! That's better! OK. are they

113
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
trigger colliders? No. they are not trigger colliders. we want it to

114
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
actually exhibit physics. So. let's try it!

115
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Oh. it bounces off! Cool!

116
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So now. we need to get our ball firing off with more velocity. bouncing

117
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
up higher and harder. It may be

118
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
worth spending a moment understanding the gravity

119
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that's working on this thing right now. So. currently

120
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
the ball has a Mass of 1. What would happen if we made the Mass

121
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
1.000. notionally 1.000 kilos?

122
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Well actually. here it doesn't make any different to how

123
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
high it goes. because remember. all object fall

124
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
at the same rate. in terms of acceleration. There's not air resistance

125
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
here. there's no linear drag. and there's no

126
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
actual collisions where the collision matters. because the

127
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
wall and the paddle are unmovable. The wall is just

128
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
colliders. they don't even have physics. and the paddle

129
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
is a physics body but it's Kinematic. which means it's not

130
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
allowed to move unless our script tells it to. So.

131
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
making the ball heavier makes no difference to how high it goes. and that's kind

132
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of what you would expect. That is the

133
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
normal fact in a uniform acceleration. so

134
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I'm going to set its Mass back to 1. So. what does this

135
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Gravity Scale thing do? Well. it's very strange. their documentation

136
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
says that Gravity Scale is the "Degree

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to which an object is affected by gravity."

138
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
But in the real world. objects don't

139
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
just choose to be affected by gravity.

140
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to a different extent to another object. Gravity

141
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
is the curvature of space time. ultimately. and

142
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that depends on the distribution of other masses around it.

143
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So. it's a bit odd to change its

144
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Gravity Scale but let's try it! Let's set its Gravity Scale to 10

145
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and see what happens. You might want to use this to create

146
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
interesting effects in a game. Just bare in mind it's not

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
very real. So. that had a very high Gravity Scale and bounced

148
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
really really quickly. Or we could set the Gravity Scale to

149
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the other extreme. which might be say 0.1.

150
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And let's see what happens there!

151
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Now it bounces

152
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
basically fine. roughly how we want it

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to. But I am going to prefer to do this a different

154
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
way. because if we say have a brick in here.

155
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that had some physics on it.

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the brick will accelerate away

157
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
too fast. compared to how fast the ball is accelerating.

158
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So. the ball and the brick would accelerate at different

159
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
speeds here. which is kind of weird. If I put

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
two bricks next to each other. this is like the feather and the

161
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
brick or the feather the golf ball. and they both have

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Rigid bodies on them.

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and one has a Gravity Scale of 0.1 and the other has a Gravity Scale

164
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
of 10. watch what happens! One accelerates very differently

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
to the other. and it's this second one that

166
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
has the same Gravity Scale now as the ball.

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
because we've divided the ball's

168
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Gravity Scale by 10. So. because we want all

169
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
objects in the game to behave consistently. I don't

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
want to change the ball's Gravity Scale. I think that's weird and

171
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I don't think it represents anything in the real world. and you may want

172
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
to use it in a game but I'm not going to do it here. But I do want it

173
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to slow down. so let's give rid of these other two bricks.

174
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Remind ourselves where we are. We''re back to where we started.

175
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
after having yet talked a bit. And we could just

176
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
send the ball off faster. but the fundamental problem is

177
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
not that it's not going off fast enough. it's that there's too much gravity.

178
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So. what I want to do is show

179
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
you another setting. Edit. Project Settings.

180
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Physics 2D. Click into that. and

181
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
at the top here. you've got a Gravity scale of -9.81.

182
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
That's roughly Earth's Gravity scale. maybe at the Equator.

183
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
<v ->9.81 meters per square second towards the center of the Earth.</v>

184
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Well. let's make that -1. about a 10th. and see what

185
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
happens. Now. this has exactly the same

186
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
apparent effect on the ball as what we did before.

187
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
which was change the ball's scale. but now. any

188
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
other objects we introduce into the game space will also

189
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
accelerate in this same way. Let's just try it by putting another

190
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
ball in here. and just drop a ball on

191
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
say there and give it a Rigidbody.

192
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And with the default settings of the Rigidbody. which come with a

193
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Gravity of 1. these two balls now behave

194
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
in a consistent way. I know that other ball is going slower

195
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and it doesn't have a collider on it. but is it still

196
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
accelerating downwards at the same rate as this ball.

197
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So. I much prefer doing it this way!

198
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I hope that all makes sense for you. in summary.

199
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Understanding Gravity Scale! It could be set in the RigidBody. but it's

200
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
a bit weird. I would use Edit. Project Settings.

201
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Physics 2D. and without

202
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
any air resistance it basically uses the equations of Uniform Acceleration.

203
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
which you can read all about on Wikipedia.

204
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Congratulations and see you soon!

=======

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey welcome back! So, we have

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
our ball physics sorted. We have our

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ball firing off the bat, when we click the button, and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
it's even bouncing off the bat. So, we now need

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to get the side walls and the top wall sorted out

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and to adjust up the speed so that the ball actually

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
has a chance of hitting the top wall. Cool! So,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
how are we going to do that? Well, we could

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
build some walls out of bricks. In fact, I went down that root

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
with this project, and it's

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a slippery slope, because once you start trying to build the wall out of bricks,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
well I certainly very quickly wanted to

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
think about how to do it with a program

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and that gets a bit technical for this stage in the course. So,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
if you're really interested in how to build a brick wall with a program,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
ask me in the discussions and I will consider putting

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
it in as a bonus video. But for now, we're just going

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to use invisible colliders and use the background

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
as the visual

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
cue, as to where the play space ends.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Firstly, I'm going to turn off my Grid Gizmo, because

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't need to see that grid. That's clearer! And now,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to create my first collider.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Before I do that, I'm going to make an organizing GameObject called Play

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Space.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm fighting the Caps Lock Key and my fingers!

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
At last, woo hoo! I typed it

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
right! OK, Play Space, Reset the Transform.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And now, I'm going to put it near the top, and I'm going to put

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the background into it. OK fantastic!

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's just for organization! Now, when I create the next empty Game

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Object, I'm going to call it Left Wall.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There it is! OK now,

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
what is the Left Wall? It's nothing but a transform in the middle of the screen

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
right now. Not a lot of use. OK

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
so, what are we going to do with it? Well, I think I'm going to Reset it to the

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
origin, down here, and I'm going to add to it

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
a Box Collider 2D.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And now, I want to... I'm going to keep its origin

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
here, actually, but I want it to extend off to the left and

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
up to the top. So, it needs to have a Y size

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
of the height of our play space, which is

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
what? It's 16, I think it was 10

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
wasn't it? Let's take a look!

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It looks like it's 12, the height of our play space. So,

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
we make our collider have a height of 12 and

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that's all very well, but now, if you want the pivot

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
of this collider to be here, then you're going to

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
have to play around with the offsets, so let's do that!

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's make the Center at X equals

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
<v ->0.5,</v>

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and that's about right

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
there! Perfect! And the Y Center at

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
<v ->6 let's try that or +6.</v>

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
+6 great! Now, let's Reset it!

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You get the idea! The combination of the Center and the

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Size tells you how this collider sits.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It frankly really doesn't matter where it's transform

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
is, but I think that's a logical place for it to be.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
OK fantastic! So, what I'd like

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you to do now, as an exercise, is setup

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the other two colliders. I'd like you to put a Top Collider

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
along here, and a Right Wall Collider

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
on the right hand side, which should be a mirror image of this one.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't mind how you do your Top Collider, as long as there are no

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
gaps. So, just to be

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
clear, I want you to pause the video and add a couple of colliders,

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
at the same width of the one I've done, which is 1 for the moment.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And ensure there are no spaces anywhere that the ball

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
could get out and test it by playing. So, pause

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the video and do that now please.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Cool! Welcome back! So, the Right Wall I'm going to do by

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
duplicating the Left Wall, firstly.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right Wall, hit Return,

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and then, I'm going to move it across.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now, the Left Wall is still there, don't worry, you just can't see it once you move

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the Right Wall. And I wanted a position

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of 17, by the looks of it, depending on where I put my origin.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then, it looks like the Center is going to be + 0.5,

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
in this case, and 16. OK!

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, that's logical because the Left Wall is at 0 and the Right

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Wall is at 16.0. I like that!

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Where would it make sense for the Top Wall's origin to be? Well, I

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
think in the middle maybe? It doesn't really matter, so let's

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
duplicate the Right Wall. Now, we

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
need to change it's Size. I'm going to go for a width of

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
16 and a height of 1. Perfect!

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going to call it a Top Wall.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OK, I'm going to Reset the Centers,

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
for the moment, just so I can get some sanity on where it is.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
0, 0. Move

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
it up. OK, let's take the Y

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Center down to +0.5. Note: It is +0.5.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
OK,

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that's fine! And then, I'm going to move the wall down

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
to precisely 12.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh dear, excuse me!

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The problem is, I've got the microphone between my face and the

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
keyboard, so I can't see my fingers half the time. And

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
an X Position of 8. Ah, that makes sense! So,

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the Left Wall is at 0, 0. It doesn't

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
really matter where it's transform is, but it looks right crucially.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to put the Top Wall in the middle, just

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
because I'm being OCD. The Top Wall is at 8,

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
12. It's in the middle at the top, that kind of makes sense,

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and then, the Right Wall is on the Right Hand side. Awesome! So, they

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
are all colliders.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Now, are we safe here if I select all of them? Do we think that

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the corner is good enough? Or do we want to make our Top Wall,

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
instead of 16 wide maybe we make it 18 wide,

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
like that, and then it overlaps completely? Oh, that

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
feels safe as houses! That's better! OK, are they

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
trigger colliders? No, they are not trigger colliders, we want it to

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
actually exhibit physics. So, let's try it!

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, it bounces off! Cool!

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So now, we need to get our ball firing off with more velocity, bouncing

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
up higher and harder. It may be

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
worth spending a moment understanding the gravity

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that's working on this thing right now. So, currently

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the ball has a Mass of 1. What would happen if we made the Mass

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
1,000, notionally 1,000 kilos?

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well actually, here it doesn't make any different to how

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
high it goes, because remember, all object fall

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
at the same rate, in terms of acceleration. There's not air resistance

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
here, there's no linear drag, and there's no

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
actual collisions where the collision matters, because the

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
wall and the paddle are unmovable. The wall is just

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
colliders, they don't even have physics, and the paddle

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is a physics body but it's Kinematic, which means it's not

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
allowed to move unless our script tells it to. So,

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
making the ball heavier makes no difference to how high it goes, and that's kind

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
of what you would expect. That is the

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
normal fact in a uniform acceleration, so

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm going to set its Mass back to 1. So, what does this

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Gravity Scale thing do? Well, it's very strange, their documentation

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
says that Gravity Scale is the "Degree

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to which an object is affected by gravity."

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But in the real world, objects don't

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
just choose to be affected by gravity,

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to a different extent to another object. Gravity

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
is the curvature of space time, ultimately, and

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that depends on the distribution of other masses around it.

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, it's a bit odd to change its

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Gravity Scale but let's try it! Let's set its Gravity Scale to 10

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and see what happens. You might want to use this to create

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
interesting effects in a game. Just bare in mind it's not

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
very real. So, that had a very high Gravity Scale and bounced

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
really really quickly. Or we could set the Gravity Scale to

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the other extreme, which might be say 0.1.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And let's see what happens there!

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now it bounces

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
basically fine, roughly how we want it

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to. But I am going to prefer to do this a different

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
way, because if we say have a brick in here,

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
that had some physics on it,

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the brick will accelerate away

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
too fast, compared to how fast the ball is accelerating.

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So, the ball and the brick would accelerate at different

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
speeds here, which is kind of weird. If I put

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
two bricks next to each other, this is like the feather and the

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
brick or the feather the golf ball, and they both have

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Rigid bodies on them,

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and one has a Gravity Scale of 0.1 and the other has a Gravity Scale

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
of 10, watch what happens! One accelerates very differently

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
to the other, and it's this second one that

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
has the same Gravity Scale now as the ball,

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
because we've divided the ball's

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Gravity Scale by 10. So, because we want all

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
objects in the game to behave consistently, I don't

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
want to change the ball's Gravity Scale. I think that's weird and

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't think it represents anything in the real world, and you may want

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
to use it in a game but I'm not going to do it here. But I do want it

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
to slow down, so let's give rid of these other two bricks.

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Remind ourselves where we are. We''re back to where we started,

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
after having yet talked a bit. And we could just

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
send the ball off faster, but the fundamental problem is

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
not that it's not going off fast enough, it's that there's too much gravity.

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So, what I want to do is show

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you another setting. Edit, Project Settings,

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Physics 2D. Click into that, and

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
at the top here, you've got a Gravity scale of -9.81.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's roughly Earth's Gravity scale, maybe at the Equator.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
<v ->9.81 meters per square second towards the center of the Earth.</v>

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, let's make that -1, about a 10th, and see what

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
happens. Now, this has exactly the same

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
apparent effect on the ball as what we did before,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
which was change the ball's scale, but now, any

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
other objects we introduce into the game space will also

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
accelerate in this same way. Let's just try it by putting another

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
ball in here, and just drop a ball on

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
say there and give it a Rigidbody.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And with the default settings of the Rigidbody, which come with a

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Gravity of 1, these two balls now behave

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
in a consistent way. I know that other ball is going slower

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and it doesn't have a collider on it, but is it still

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
accelerating downwards at the same rate as this ball.

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So, I much prefer doing it this way!

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I hope that all makes sense for you, in summary.

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Understanding Gravity Scale! It could be set in the RigidBody, but it's

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
a bit weird. I would use Edit, Project Settings,

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Physics 2D, and without

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
any air resistance it basically uses the equations of Uniform Acceleration,

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
which you can read all about on Wikipedia.

204
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Congratulations and see you soon!
