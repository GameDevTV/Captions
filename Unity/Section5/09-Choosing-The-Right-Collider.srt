00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey welcome back! So. in

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
this video we're going to get our ball bouncing. Let's

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
see where we're starting from. So. we have

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a Start Menu with some music. that

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
persists into the game. The ball falls out of the play space.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and we may have beaten the game. but personally.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it doesn't satisfy me very much. Not much of a challenge right?

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So. we need to have a paddle in

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
place. at the bottom. to block the ball.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So. go into your level. focus on your background

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
framing. as Unity calls it.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And let's go and grab our sprite.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that is our full brick. and let's pop it into the scene.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now. by dragging the sprite into

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the scene and letting go. let's see what happens.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
A few things have happened. it's created a GameObject

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
here. called full brick. the same name as the sprite.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's positioned it. wherever we left

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
it. and I'm actually going to position mine 8 units in

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and 0.5 world units up.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So. we're precisely under the ball here.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It has also got a Transform.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as all GameObjects do by default. and a Sprite Renderer

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
on it. so we can see it in the scene. And let's just look at it

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in the game. It's all very well!

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The ball passes straight through it. which is interesting.

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but we'll deal with that in a moment. So. I'm going to rename

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
my full brick to simply Paddle.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I would like to organize... Oh. you see the naming. you have to be

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
careful that you definitely hit Return. if you're

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
going to rename in the Inspector. There you go!

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's definitely changed. Now. I'm going to move it below Ball but above

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the LooseCollider. so we have a logical sequence of Ball. Paddle.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Lose Collider. The ordering here. in the Hierarchy.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
doesn't make any different to how the game operates. it's just for your

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
own sanity. keeping check.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So. we need to add a collider to our

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
paddle. to stop the ball from passing straight through it. The question is.

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
what sort of collider? Hmm. good

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
question? So. let's start by reminding ourselves what the Ball

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is. The Ball has a Rigidbody

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
on it. which is not Kinematic.

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and it has a Collider on it. that is not a Trigger.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So. what type of collider does the ball have? What do we call

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
it? Do you remember this table that we produced?

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well. the Ball.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
as I've shown here vertically. is a Ribidbody

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Collider. because it's not static

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
because it has a Rigidbody on it. It's not a Kinematic

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Rigid body. because the Rigidbody is not Kinematic.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Kinematic Rigidbodies. basically. you have to more yourself.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The Physics Engine doesn't move them.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And it's not a Trigger. The Collider is not set to

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
a Trigger. so the column. the verticle we're dealing with

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is a Rigidbody Collider. on the Ball. Now comes the

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
question. what type of collider should we put on the paddle?

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Well. we're going to be moving the paddle right?

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So. Static Colliders. at the top on the left. are

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
out. because we're not supposed to move State Colliders. They're

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
for things like walls. The walls of the game will be Static Colliders.

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So. what's the next thing it could be? Could it be a

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Rigid body Collider or a Kinematic Rigidbody Collider?

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Well. you're going to experiment with that in a minute. It's definately

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
either a Kinematic Rigidbody or just a plain

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Rigidbody. because we want a collision to come out of

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
this result. not just a Trigger. We actually want the Physics Engine to

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
work for us. in this game. because it's very much a physics based

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
game. So. next

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
thing you're going to need to know. of course. is what is a Rigidbody? What is

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
this Rigidgody thing. in a bit more detail? Well.

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
let's take a quick look! Let's see what Unity has to say about it!

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
"Rigid bodies enable your GameObjects

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to act under the control of physics. The Rigidbody can receive

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
forces and torque to make your objects move in a realistic way..."

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So. that's what's making our ball fall. at the moment. It's

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the fact it's got a Rigidbody on it and some gravity. That's what's pulling

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
the ball downwards right now. You can read more

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
about Rigidbodies. in Unity's manual there. which I think

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I have the page open over here for you. Yes I do!

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's probably worth a read. But the question

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
remains. what type of collider should we

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
be putting on our paddle?

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I want you to think about that yourself.

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And as a challenge for you. I want you

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to find and add the appropriate 2D collider

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
to the paddle. It's not going to be a

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Circle Collier. but it's pretty obvious what type it should be.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I then want you to find and

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
add the Rigidbody2D component to

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the paddle. that we just created.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and then. play around and see

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
what happens. when you set the Rigidbody2D to Kinematic

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
vs. Non-Kinematic? And have a play with some of

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
those other settings. We can always reset the component. don't worry.

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And then. come back to me after you've paused the video. See if you can get

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to a point where the ball just stops dead. when it hits the

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
paddle. OK. pause the video and try that now.

98
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So fantastic! Welcome back! I hope you paused the video. I hope you did your

99
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
challenge. Let's just start playing. Here's the Paddle.

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We are going to firstly need to

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
add that collider. so Add Component. Physics 2D.

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Box Collider. would clearly be the right one.

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
because it's a box. Now. let's just double click on the Paddle and

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
take a look! That collider is in green there. How do I know?

105
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Well. I could disable and re-enable the Box

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Collider. here in the Inspector. and you'll just see a green outline.

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Another way is. I could increase the size of it to make it

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
bigger or smaller than the paddle. but I actually want it to be

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
default size. so I'm going to reset the collider.

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
because it did a good job of finding the outside of the paddle.

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Good! So. we have a collider! Let's see what happens with just a collider!

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Boom! It lands

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and stops! That's good! So. what have we got

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
here. at this stage? What type of collider have we got

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
on the paddle?

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Well. it's a Static Collider. It may seem like it's

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
doing the job. but it's not good. because it's a Static Collider.

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This thing is not supposed to be moving. It's very inefficient

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
to use Static Colliders. So. we're going to go ahead and add

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
this Physics 2D. Rigidbody 2D

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
component. Let's leave all the settings

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
as default and see what happens.

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Ooh. what happened there? We have to look really carefully. So. if you need

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to look carefully. what you can do is you can hit pause

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
then play.

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and then. you can step through. one frame at

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
a time and see what happens. using this button here.

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
See! The paddle was falling off the

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
screen as well. So. if we look at the Paddle.

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
it's because it has Mass

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and a Gravity Scale.

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So. you could set the Gravity Scale to 0. Let's see

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
what that does. How come is the ball...

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Ah. so let's watch that again! Again. using

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
the slow motion. so pause then play.

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Now. the paddle is not moving.

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
but when the ball excelerates down and hits the

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
paddle. the ball has mass the paddle has mass. so the ball knocks

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the paddle out of the way. Not right either! OK.

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
so how about if we were to

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
have another look at the paddle and say. how about if it had no Mass?

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Well then. it would just accelerate off really fast. How about if you had

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
massive Mass? Well. maybe it would stay in place

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
if it had a massive Mass. but that's a hack right. I don't like that.

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So. don't do that. What we actually want to do is make

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
this paddle Kinematic. Now. you can read in the manual

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
what Kinematic means. I'll show you briefly.

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Here! "If enabled the object will

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
not be driven by the physics engine. and can only be manipulated by its

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Transform. This is useful for moving platforms or if you want

151
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
to animate a Rigidbody that has a Hingejoint". So. this is

152
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
basically a moving platform. this thing. So. if we

153
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
make it Kinematic. then

154
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
let's see what happens. Bump!

155
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
OK. so the paddle is ignoring the Physics

156
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Engine. which is perfect. It's exactly what we want. We have

157
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the ball. that has some mass. hitting this paddle that will not move

158
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
unless our script moves it. So. looking back into

159
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the presentation. we have this

160
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
interaction here. between the Rigidbody Collider

161
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and the Kinematic Rigidbody

162
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Collider. So. the ball is a Rigidbody Collider

163
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and the paddle becomes a Kinematic Rigidbody

164
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Collider.

165
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So congratulations if you got that far! Hopefully you understand more

166
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
about colliders and physics. And I shall

167
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.566
see you shortly!

=======

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey welcome back! So, in

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
this video we're going to get our ball bouncing. Let's

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
see where we're starting from. So, we have

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a Start Menu with some music, that

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
persists into the game. The ball falls out of the play space,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we may have beaten the game, but personally,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it doesn't satisfy me very much. Not much of a challenge right?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, we need to have a paddle in

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
place, at the bottom, to block the ball.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, go into your level, focus on your background

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
framing, as Unity calls it.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And let's go and grab our sprite,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that is our full brick, and let's pop it into the scene.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, by dragging the sprite into

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the scene and letting go, let's see what happens.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A few things have happened, it's created a GameObject

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
here, called full brick, the same name as the sprite.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's positioned it, wherever we left

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
it, and I'm actually going to position mine 8 units in

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and 0.5 world units up.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, we're precisely under the ball here.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It has also got a Transform,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
as all GameObjects do by default, and a Sprite Renderer

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
on it, so we can see it in the scene. And let's just look at it

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in the game. It's all very well!

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The ball passes straight through it, which is interesting,

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but we'll deal with that in a moment. So, I'm going to rename

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
my full brick to simply Paddle.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I would like to organize... Oh, you see the naming, you have to be

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
careful that you definitely hit Return, if you're

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
going to rename in the Inspector. There you go!

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's definitely changed. Now, I'm going to move it below Ball but above

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the LooseCollider, so we have a logical sequence of Ball, Paddle,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lose Collider. The ordering here, in the Hierarchy,

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
doesn't make any different to how the game operates, it's just for your

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
own sanity, keeping check.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, we need to add a collider to our

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
paddle, to stop the ball from passing straight through it. The question is,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
what sort of collider? Hmm, good

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
question? So, let's start by reminding ourselves what the Ball

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is. The Ball has a Rigidbody

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
on it, which is not Kinematic,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and it has a Collider on it, that is not a Trigger.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So, what type of collider does the ball have? What do we call

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it? Do you remember this table that we produced?

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, the Ball,

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
as I've shown here vertically, is a Ribidbody

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Collider, because it's not static

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
because it has a Rigidbody on it. It's not a Kinematic

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Rigid body, because the Rigidbody is not Kinematic.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Kinematic Rigidbodies, basically, you have to more yourself.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The Physics Engine doesn't move them.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And it's not a Trigger. The Collider is not set to

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
a Trigger, so the column, the verticle we're dealing with

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is a Rigidbody Collider, on the Ball. Now comes the

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
question, what type of collider should we put on the paddle?

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, we're going to be moving the paddle right?

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, Static Colliders, at the top on the left, are

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
out, because we're not supposed to move State Colliders. They're

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
for things like walls. The walls of the game will be Static Colliders.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, what's the next thing it could be? Could it be a

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Rigid body Collider or a Kinematic Rigidbody Collider?

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, you're going to experiment with that in a minute. It's definately

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
either a Kinematic Rigidbody or just a plain

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Rigidbody, because we want a collision to come out of

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
this result, not just a Trigger. We actually want the Physics Engine to

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
work for us, in this game, because it's very much a physics based

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
game. So, next

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
thing you're going to need to know, of course, is what is a Rigidbody? What is

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
this Rigidgody thing, in a bit more detail? Well,

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
let's take a quick look! Let's see what Unity has to say about it!

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
"Rigid bodies enable your GameObjects

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to act under the control of physics. The Rigidbody can receive

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
forces and torque to make your objects move in a realistic way..."

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, that's what's making our ball fall, at the moment. It's

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the fact it's got a Rigidbody on it and some gravity. That's what's pulling

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
the ball downwards right now. You can read more

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
about Rigidbodies, in Unity's manual there, which I think

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have the page open over here for you. Yes I do!

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's probably worth a read. But the question

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
remains, what type of collider should we

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
be putting on our paddle?

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I want you to think about that yourself.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And as a challenge for you, I want you

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to find and add the appropriate 2D collider

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
to the paddle. It's not going to be a

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Circle Collier, but it's pretty obvious what type it should be.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I then want you to find and

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
add the Rigidbody2D component to

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the paddle, that we just created,

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and then, play around and see

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
what happens, when you set the Rigidbody2D to Kinematic

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
vs. Non-Kinematic? And have a play with some of

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
those other settings. We can always reset the component, don't worry.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then, come back to me after you've paused the video. See if you can get

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
to a point where the ball just stops dead, when it hits the

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
paddle. OK, pause the video and try that now.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So fantastic! Welcome back! I hope you paused the video. I hope you did your

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
challenge. Let's just start playing. Here's the Paddle.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We are going to firstly need to

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
add that collider, so Add Component, Physics 2D,

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Box Collider, would clearly be the right one,

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
because it's a box. Now, let's just double click on the Paddle and

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
take a look! That collider is in green there. How do I know?

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, I could disable and re-enable the Box

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Collider, here in the Inspector, and you'll just see a green outline.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Another way is, I could increase the size of it to make it

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
bigger or smaller than the paddle, but I actually want it to be

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
default size, so I'm going to reset the collider,

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
because it did a good job of finding the outside of the paddle.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Good! So, we have a collider! Let's see what happens with just a collider!

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Boom! It lands

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and stops! That's good! So, what have we got

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
here, at this stage? What type of collider have we got

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
on the paddle?

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, it's a Static Collider. It may seem like it's

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
doing the job, but it's not good, because it's a Static Collider.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This thing is not supposed to be moving. It's very inefficient

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to use Static Colliders. So, we're going to go ahead and add

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
this Physics 2D, Rigidbody 2D

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
component. Let's leave all the settings

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
as default and see what happens.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ooh, what happened there? We have to look really carefully. So, if you need

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to look carefully, what you can do is you can hit pause

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
then play,

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and then, you can step through, one frame at

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
a time and see what happens, using this button here.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
See! The paddle was falling off the

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
screen as well. So, if we look at the Paddle,

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
it's because it has Mass

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and a Gravity Scale.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, you could set the Gravity Scale to 0. Let's see

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
what that does. How come is the ball...

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ah, so let's watch that again! Again, using

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
the slow motion, so pause then play.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, the paddle is not moving,

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but when the ball excelerates down and hits the

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
paddle, the ball has mass the paddle has mass, so the ball knocks

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
the paddle out of the way. Not right either! OK,

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
so how about if we were to

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
have another look at the paddle and say, how about if it had no Mass?

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well then, it would just accelerate off really fast. How about if you had

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
massive Mass? Well, maybe it would stay in place

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
if it had a massive Mass, but that's a hack right. I don't like that.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So, don't do that. What we actually want to do is make

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
this paddle Kinematic. Now, you can read in the manual

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
what Kinematic means. I'll show you briefly.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Here! "If enabled the object will

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
not be driven by the physics engine, and can only be manipulated by its

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Transform. This is useful for moving platforms or if you want

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to animate a Rigidbody that has a Hingejoint". So, this is

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
basically a moving platform, this thing. So, if we

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
make it Kinematic, then

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
let's see what happens. Bump!

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
OK, so the paddle is ignoring the Physics

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Engine, which is perfect. It's exactly what we want. We have

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the ball, that has some mass, hitting this paddle that will not move

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
unless our script moves it. So, looking back into

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the presentation, we have this

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
interaction here, between the Rigidbody Collider

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and the Kinematic Rigidbody

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Collider. So, the ball is a Rigidbody Collider

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and the paddle becomes a Kinematic Rigidbody

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Collider.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So congratulations if you got that far! Hopefully you understand more

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
about colliders and physics. And I shall

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,566
see you shortly!
