1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey welcome

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
back! So, we're going to add some music to our menu system, and

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
all the way through the game, it's going to be persistent music. I

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
was playing Escape Plan, on the PS4, the other day,

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it just struck me that the fact the music

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
starts when the game starts and then continues

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
through as you load levels, etc., just really bonded

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the whole game together. So, I've decided to show you how

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to do that here. So, we're going to add a MusicPlayer Game Object,

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then, we're going to add a music track of our choice

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and then use a command called GameObject

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
.DontDestroyOnLoad() to prevent that

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
music from stopping player or in said

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
differently, to make it continue playing when you load the next level.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then, we'll test it all and we'll be done, so let's

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
take a look. The first thing you're going to need to do is

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
source a relevant music track, so why don't we just do that

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
straight away. So, freesound.org

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
would be a good place to go for that. And

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you want to look for songs with a Creative Commons License, so let's

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
go to www.creativesound.org, here it is. So,

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in order to download a track from these guys, you will need an account, so just

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
create yourself an account, and you will have to activate that

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
account, by e-mail. So, once you're logged into freesound.org,

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
you can tell I'm logged in, because my name is here and I have a Logout Button.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Then, search! I'm going to search for something like game music.

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now, before you get too excited about anything you find,

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I would click the Creative Commons License Button,

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
first. You want to be filtering for Creative Commons

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Tracks. Then, look down and try and find something you like

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the sound of. What does Grasshopper look like?

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Not much! [Laughs] OK!

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What does Happy 8 Bit

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Pixel Adventure sound like? [Music Plays]

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
[Music Plays]

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
[Music Plays] That's pretty

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
cool! I quite like that!

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Is there anything else? Nodense, is that more appropriate?  [Music Plays]

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[Music Plays]

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
[Music Plays]

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
OK, that's pretty good, too! So, that one, how long is it?

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
About a minute, by the looks of it. If I click at the start,

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's about a minute, and this Happy 8 Pixel Adventure is 1

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
minute 52. Let's... [Music Plays]

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Yeah, I'm going to go

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
for the Happy 8 Bit Pixel Adventure Track, just

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
it's a bit longer and it's going to loop less often and I don't know.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Who cares, just pick a track! So, click on it,

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and download. You'll get a .mp3

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
file, in this case a .wav file actually. Here's a .wav file.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
A .wav file is going to be a bit big. How big is it? 40

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
meg. Wooh! 40 megs, a little

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
chunky! So, what I'm going to suggest is either grab a different

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
sound, which I'll try while this downloads, or

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
if you do want to go with a .wav, I would convert it to a .mp3,

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
because at 40 meg, that's going to slow down the loading of your

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
web build, quite a lot really. So, let's try

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
this one, Nodens, which was my second favorite choice.

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Now, that's only 795 kilobytes.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Ah, so look it's entirely up to you. If  you can be bothered to convert

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
your .wav into a .mp3 and try and get it a sensible

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
size, which really means less than a couple of meg, go

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
ahead. I'm going to stop this download, and I'm going to go for this

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
other song, just because it's smaller. OK, so it's

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
"Nodens (Field Song)" I'm going for, which you can get from Free Sound.

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
There it is! Downloaded it

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
before actually, so what you need to do next is drag

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
it into Unity. So you won't have a Sounds Folder yet, so it can go

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
straight into the Assets Folder.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There it comes! Di do di do di da da da

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
do boo! Done fantastic! Alright, so I'm going

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
to be tidy and make a new folder called More Sounds, and

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
put all our sound effects in there.

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
While we've got the Inspector opened for this

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
sound, you see up on the top right, in the Inspector

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
when clicked on the sound clip,

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
it says 3D sound is ticked. Well, if you want to

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
un-tick that, then that would be more appropriate for this

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
game. I'll be doing that later in the project, but this is a good

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
time for you to un-tick it, then it will come out of both ears at a more sensible

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
volume. Now, looking at that file name is pretty

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
disgusting. Really, I can't really understand what that's talking about.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So I'm going to say, I don't know bg music, or something

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
like that, and then,

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I'm going to leave a bit of the original file name on, so I can

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
find it again. Imagine I come back to this in several months and think, what the hell is that

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
music? Where did I get it from? Well, at least I would be able to find

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
it by searching "Nodens (Field Song)".

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
You'll probably also

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
find, when it's finished reprocessing the sound, that if we look for that

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in our File System, and then,

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
take a look at the file that it's got, it'll have some

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
sort of, here you go, Meta Data on it. Video Game Music,

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Slow Electronic Song, it came from Free Sound, so here you go.

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is your best way to get back to it, if you ever wanted to. It's all in the Meta Data.

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Cool! So, there it is, we have a sound.

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So, the next thing we need to do, given that we've got a sound in Unity, is

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
firstly make it not a 3D sound. Just it's going to

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
make volume management easier. This is a 2D game,

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
we don't need a 3D sound, so turn that off and Apply it.

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I'm sorry, if you've got a slow computer, this could take a

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
while to process, but mine is quite

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
quick, so it should be OK. Bang! Done! Alright! Now,

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
What we need to do is go to your Start Menu, because it's

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
there that want the music to play for the first time.

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Create an empty game object,

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
call it, I'm going to call it Music...

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Player. I'm going to use a space, because it's clearer. Now,

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
this will only save if you specifically hit Return up here.

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The way that you know it's saved the name is because it'll change in the Hierarchy.

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, I have a MusicPlayer Game Object. Now, I can add the

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
sound to it. Just grab it, drag it, and drop it on the Inspector

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
or on the object itself, over here, and it will

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
add a component called an AudioSource. It guesses what you mean by

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
saying, I want to drop it.

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I'm going to reset the Transform of this, so click on the Transform of

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the MusicPlayer and Reset, because you really

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
want all Game Objects that don't have a physical

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
location, a physical meaning, to be at the

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Origin, just for tidiness. I'm actually going to move it up immediately under the

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
camera, because just to me it makes sense. You've got the camera and

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
the MusicPlayer. I'm going to call to the volume,

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
from the word go, because it's background music. So, before I even

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
test it against sound effects, that we will add later, I'm just

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
going to make the volume a lot quieter. And now, I'm going to make sure

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that it plays on the Start Menu.

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
[Music Plays] Great!

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So, it plays without deafening me. So of course, if I was to click the Start

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Button, we change scenes

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but no more music, right? [Music Plays]

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
[Music Plays] Till we get back to the Start Menu.

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So, that's all very well, but we want the music, we said, to continue

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
through all the time. So, how do we make that happen? Well,

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that's where our cunning GameObject.

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
.DontDestroyOnLoad () comes in.

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Where is it? Here! I said we were

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
going to show you this, yellow command, GameObject.DontDestroyOnLoad ().

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So, let's do it. Where do you think that's going to go, that

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
script? Where do I write the command? Where do I put the script? Well, it's

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
about playing music, so it's going to need its own script, its own class.

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So, let's make that, and I'm going to call it very imaginatively,

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Music Player. We typically do, when we have a single

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
script component on something, we

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
typically call it the same thing as the actual object.

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
You know, if you had a paddle you'd call it a paddle script,

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
if you had a ball you'd call it a ball script. If it's a dog call

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
it a dog. At the end of the day, when you start adding multiple scripts, multiple

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
components, of course you need to think about your naming more carefully.

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So, we name this script with a capital M, because it is a class and

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
no space, because we're not allowed spaces. Cool!

151
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Now, where does it put the script? Good thing is it's attached nicely to

152
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the MusicPlayer. Bad thing it's gone in the root of Assets, so let's tidy that up,

153
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and finally, let's get into our script.

154
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
By the way, eventually, we're going to play with real blocks. [Laughs] This

155
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
is all preparatory work. So, this is a static method of Game

156
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Object, so don't worry too much about what that means, at the moment,

157
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
but it's something that takes in a GameObject

158
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
instance and makes sure that it does not

159
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
get destroyed on load. That's what you need to know. So, I just want to take a

160
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
moment to explain, even more clearly, exactly what this

161
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
gameObject with a small g thing is.

162
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
If we look at our Start Scene here,

163
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the GameObject is the MusicPlayer. It's

164
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
the instance of the MusicPlayer, you can see it there in the Hierarchy,

165
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and in terms of what's in the Inspector it's

166
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
the whole thing; the MusicPlayer and all its components, such as

167
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Transform, AudioSource, and the script attached

168
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to it. So, that's what gameObject is with a small g.

169
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So, here it is, having saved that script and go

170
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
back to Unity, what happens? Well, let's see!

171
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Click play, now click Start,

172
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
pause it

173
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
so you can hear what I'm saying. Now, we're in the

174
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Game Scene now. We're actually in Level 01, it

175
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
does not reflect in the top of Unity, during Play

176
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Mode, we're in Play Mode, but we are obviously in the

177
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Level 01. And look, over here in the Hierarchy, we have

178
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
a MusicPlayer. It's moved through it's continued through, so let's

179
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
just watch the entire cycle.

180
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
[Music Plays]

181
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
[Music Plays]

182
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Music Plays]

183
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
[Music Plays]

184
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Fantastic! So, we're nearly there! The

185
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
MusicPlayer is continuing and persisting through all of the scene

186
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
loads, without any interruption, which sounds really good and really

187
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
co -adheres the game together. One little problem is that when we

188
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
arrive back at the Start Scene, if we do go full circle,

189
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
a new MusicPlayer gets created, so let's look at

190
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
how to stop that happening.
