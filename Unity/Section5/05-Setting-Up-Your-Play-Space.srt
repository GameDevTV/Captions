00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey. welcome back! So. the focus of this

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
video is setting up your Play Space.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So. one of the first things we need to decide is

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
what size is this Play Space? Well. if we go to Google.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I mentioned before the iPad Air resolution

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
just is an example target resolution.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
also will fit OK on the web. if we downscale.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So. let's look at that. 2048 x

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
1536. My first question is what's the

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Aspect Ratio of that? Have a look. It's 1.333

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
33333. OK. what you'll notice is it's actually

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the same as 800 x 600.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's also 1.3 reoccurring.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So. 800 by 600 is compatible with that much higher

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a resolution. And in fact. when you download your course

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
assets. you'll find that the Block Breaker Assets

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Sprites Folder contains two background images.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This guy here. who's an angry looking robot

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or something. which we're going to use for Level 1. and then.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I've just chosen arbitrarily another one. which is 800

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
x 600. This one is a train track. and it just doesn't matter really. you

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
choose your own images. But they're both 800 by 600.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So. first job is to get the background image into Unity.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
so just simply drag into your

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Sprites Folder and there it is.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Once it's in your Sprites Folder. it's just an image. it's simply that.

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We have to think a little bit about our

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Pixels per unit up here. because

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we're going to have 16 blocks wide. as

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a total overall game space. And

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we have an image. that is 800

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Pixels wide. so we want 800 Pixels

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to map to 16 World Units.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
because we're going to go for one World Unit per block. World

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Units. for those of you who don't know. are the position in

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Unity's game space. They're what you see in the

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
transform. over in the Inspector. in the X and

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Y. They're held as a floating point value and they are

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
relative to some arbitrary origin. in the middle

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of the Unity World Space. So. this is about

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
how a certain image in Pixels is

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
actually going to be scaled and displayed in the World Space.

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So. the Pixels

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
per World Unit we need is 50. Let's try it and see what happens.

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So. we go for 50 in here

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and Apply. Now. drop your Level

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
1 background on.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
like so.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[background Noise]

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
There it is! Once you've zoomed in. there is your Level 1 background. If you

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
double click on it in the Hierarchy. then you will see

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it on the screen. Now. the question is. how big is that thing?

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
On here. let's reset its transform first. so click on the cob

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and reset. So. now the Level 1 background is at

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the very bottom left of the screen. Let's find

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
out how big it is. One way of doing this. for example. would be to

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
grab the Main Camera. and while you've got the Main Camera

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
open. I just want you to check that the Projection Mode

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
here on the right hand side is Orthographic

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
rather than Perspective. An Orthographic

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Camera does not take account of how far away

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
an object is from it. at all.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Whereas a Perspective Camera does. So. it's important for this project

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that we're set up with an Orthographic Camera.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Also. while you've got the camera open. I'd like you to check the

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Z position of the background image. up at the top right

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
here. It needs to be in the negative Z. which is

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
away from you. otherwise it won't be visible to the

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
camera. So. it doesn't matter what distance it's at. because it's an

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Orthographic perspective-less camera. but it does

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
need to be away from the camera. in the negative Z direction.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
OK. so to measure the width

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
of this Play Space. we move the camera firstly to the left

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and have a look at the X position.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and then. move the camera to the right hand side

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and you see it's plus 8. Great! So. the image is

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
16 World Units wide. which is great. I'm going to

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
rename this. just Background.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and I'm going to stick it up right

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
below the Main Camera. just for neatness.

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Fantastic! So. we have a background that is 16 World Units wide.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The next thing we want to do. I think. is alpha

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that background down. which means make it a little bit transparent.

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
try and make it a little more subtle. So. click on your Color Picker.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and you can leave it at white. so that

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
it doesn't tint the background but you can drag the alpha down.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
so that it just becomes more dim. I'm going to go for

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
something like that. Just pick something that you like.

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That's great! So. we have a subtle background. Now. what's this

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
thing on here. this annoying thing? That's just its

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
transform. That is just

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
where its Anchor Point is. So if we click

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
on our Background image and go to the Sprite

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Editor. it would be better if the Pivot Point of

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
this image was at the bottom left. So. you can either

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
drag to the bottom left. being sure it's snapped. or choose here

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and Apply.

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So. now when you click on your Background. you have

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
your Transform Tool down a the bottom left like that. which is much more...

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Please if for any reason your transform

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
is showing in the middle of your image. like this.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
then it's this button up at the top left here. You have

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Center and Global. You may have clicked it across

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
the center. at some point. so you just click it back to

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Pivot. on the left hand side. and you will then see the

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
transform. at the Pivot Point rather than in the center

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
of the object. So. the object is the Background.

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
this is showing the Center. this is now showing the Pivot.

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So. that's just a little gotcha! Let's adjust

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the camera. so it's roughly the right

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
size for the play space. Now. you'll notice. you cannot change the

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Aspect Ratio of the camera. at the moment. Why not?

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Because it's determined by the current size of this Game

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Window. If I was to bring my Inspector

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in and make the Game Window more square. look back on the scene.

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
you see it's more square. so that's actually a problem.

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We don't want the Camera Aspect Ratio to change.

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
as we mess around in Unity. so let's lock the

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Aspect Ratio of the Game Window now. Click on Game.

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
At the top left. you'll see a drop-down that says

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Free Aspect. Well. we don't want Free Aspect.

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
we want an Aspect Ratio of 4:3.

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
which is the same a 1.33333 to 1.

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
There you go! Fantastic! So. now that is locked. so whatever happens

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
here. now when we start moving our things around and re-sizing

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the Game Window. the aspect of it is locked. So. that's a very useful tool.

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Alright. so next we need to get the camera to be exactly

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the same size as the background. How are you going to do that? Well.

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
this is where you need to understand a little bit about what this camera size

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
means. It's currently. on my screen. set to 7.5.

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
What does that mean? Well. it's 7.5 World Units

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
from the center here to the top of the camera.

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It's half the height of the Camera Viewport.

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So. we need a bit of math again. If our

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Play Space is 16 wide.

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and we have an Aspect Ratio of 4:3.

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
then how high is it? Well. we have to do

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
16 divided by 4

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
times 3. which tells us the Play Space should be

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
12 World Units high. Which means

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
that the camera setting should be a size of 6. half of that.

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
There you go. perfect! Nearly perfect!

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
If you set the transform to 8. 6. rather than to 8. 6 point

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
1. now the camera is perfectly aligned. Look!

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Background image. you can see

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
the image. it has not kind of gizmos around the outside of it.

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The Main Camera sits perfectly

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
over the top of it. Great job! So.

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that's it! Now. let's just click play and see what happens.

150
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Well. we see the background. and it's perfectly sitting inside the

151
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
camera. and if we detach our Game Tab. then

152
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that is all just working fine.

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But the Game Over Button is being a bit weird. it only shows

154
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
in some circumstances. so let's

155
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
just fix that so we can always see it. And the reason is that. when we've

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
fixed the Aspect Ratio of the Game.

157
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
our button disappeared off. So. just stick it

158
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
back in the window. And this is a Screen Space

159
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Overlay. remember. I've specifically left it like this with our

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
background. tiny in the bottom. to show you that a

161
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Screen Space Overlay just

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is relative to the screen. and it doesn't care how big

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
your actual background and other assets are. So. now

164
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
where we see this button. inside the Screen Space Overlay. is where

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
we will see it when we click the play. Yeah.

166
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It just overlays over the top. We're going to ditch all that stuff soon

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
anyway. but for now look. you've done great! If we focus back

168
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
on our background. we have a background positioned

169
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
at the Origin. Just check that. We have its

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Pivot Point. at the bottom left. which is sensible.

171
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and we have a camera that is precisely

172
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
coincident with what we see there.

173
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So. cool! See you soon!
