
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey welcome back! So, in this video we're going

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to make our blocks actually be destroyed when

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the ball hits them, rather than just

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
loading a level. So, let's take a look at how we're

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
going to do that. If you pop into your Brick Script,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you'll recall that we already publicly exposed

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
a maximum hits variable. We're not using it yet.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If you look in Unity, under Prefabs

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in the Inspector against the

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
script, you'll see a maximum hits number

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
exposed there, which should already be set to 1 for the

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
yellow, meaning it's going to be destroyed immediately.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Two for green means it goes on the second hit and three for red.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, in this video what we're going to be doing

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is, discussing how the Destroy() method works,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
explaining why we destroyed

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
gameObject and not this, and then, I'm going to challenge you

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to only destroy it, when the maximum number of hits are met.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So, back into our script then.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's get rid of

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
this SimulateWin(); line, we don't need that anymore!

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's gone. What we're going to do is firstly

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
think, well what are we going to destroy? Well, I'll tell

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
you for a start that the keyword we need is Destroy. Now, let's

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
go to Unity's docs for Destroy. Here

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
they are! They're expecting to destroy an object.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's Object.Destroy, and there's no

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
example available. So, what have we got? There's

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
two possibilities, maybe. One would be this

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which is a brick, actually not an object, and another

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
would be (gameObject), which is actually what we're looking

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
for. So, you need to Destroy (gameObject);

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you try and destroy this, it won't work because this is a brick

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and (gameObject) is actually the object you're looking for.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alright, so just remember when you destroy you Destroy(gameObject);

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and save your script and let's try it!

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ah, that's good!

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, it's a start! Right now, the bricks are being destroyed. Now of course, the

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
green bricks are being destroyed on one hit, and that's because

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we haven't told the system to do anything different

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to that, but at least we have our first inkling of a

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
working Arkanoid clone. So congratulations

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
on that bit! Now, what I want you to do as a challenge is

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I want you to put an if statement around the

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Destroy line, line 24 on my screen, and

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I want you to make sure that the

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
brick is only destroyed when you get to maximum

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
hits. So to be clear, yellow bricks should destroy immediately as they are,

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
but green bricks should only destroy on the second hit.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And if that's working red bricks should work as well.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, test that by playing. Pop a couple of red bricks

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
in the scene and make sure that all of that works. So, please

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
pause the video and put that simple if statement around

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the outside of the destroy line, now.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Cool and welcome back! So, this is how I'm doing it!

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to say, if. And I will

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
do my brackets and my curly brackets first. Of course, the

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
second curly brace needs to go under destroy.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, this is only a single line code block here.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You can write it, if you wish, like this,

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
if something Destroy, but I would

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
really prefer you be in the habit of always using

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
code blocks, because if you do this the temptation could be

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to do that, which is also OK.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If some condition Destroy the (gameObject), but then if

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you go and write "some line here" that will

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
not get executed inside the if.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It will get executed outside of the if, i.e., this

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
"will ALWAYS BE

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
EXECUTED", because you've basically

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
indented wrongly and you should have indented like so,

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and the if statement is separate. So look, that's all bloody

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
confusing! So, what I like to do is immediately

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
that I write the world if, I use

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
curly braces immediately, so

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
that I know I'm dealing with a code block. If I want to add another

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
line here, it's going to work as we expect.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright, so if something destroyed the GameObject, well

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
if what? Well, it's go to do with timesHit and maxHit.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
timesHit starts at 0, so if (times

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hit is = to maxHits)

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
we destroy the object, right. So, in the beginning it's 0,

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and for the yellow block the maxHits is

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
is 1. So, this doesn't occur and it doesn't destroy,

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and then, when it hits 1 it will

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
destroy. Let's test it!

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OK, so we have:

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
"Cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'bool'"

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
on line 25. So, bool is to do a

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Boolean, it's a yes, no, true, false, and int is an Integer.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, you double. Sorry line twenty-five

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
click on that error and it'll take you to the line. Another way of finding

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the error is to go to Build and Build All, and it will show

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you the error straight away. The problem is, I'm using =.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's actually ==! You do a comparison

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
with ==. Equals itself

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
alone is an assignment. It was trying to set maxHit

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
into timesHit OK,

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and then, the result of that was

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
an Integer and it was expecting a Boolean.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Very confusing, so == for a comparison please.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's try again!

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
OK, hit two

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
blocks at once. There you go! OK, so the yellow blocks appear to be working, but

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that's not surprising, because they were working before. Now, let's see the green blocks,

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
when I finally hit one. Now, these boring play

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
loops that we can get in like this, we're going to fix those later.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
For now, I'm just going to start the game again, because it got

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
into what I call a boring play loop. Let's just try again!

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What we're aiming to do is hit a green

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
block, and then, see... There you go! One hit on

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
that green block. Now, to test it, I would like to hit the

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
same green block again, so it can be a little bit tedious, but at least

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you're getting to play your game. That's interesting! I'm not

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
entirely sure which block I hit, so

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you're just going to have to potentially play this a few times.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There you go! If you get it up in that gap then that's

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
great, so now we're hitting all of these blocks once. [Laughs]

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's here to test us! It doesn't want us

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
to see what happens if we hit a green block twice. I think

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
every single green block on the top there, or practically all of them got hit.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, in a minute we're going to get our way, and we're going to get a

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
second hit on a green block. Oh no! It's here to test

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
my patience! Are we ever going to hit a

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
green block again! Oh wow, at last and it

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
gets destroyed! So it works, fantastic! That's

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
great news! So, what I would like to do,

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
rather than say == is, I would like to say

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
let's go greater than our =. Why?

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, imagine that in the future we extend the behavior

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and we have some super ball or something, that has the

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
effect of hitting a brick twice. You could completely

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
skip the limit. You could have had one hit initially,

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and then, suddenly three or four or five and then,

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you would never equal it. So, if we go greater than our equals,

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
we're guarding against the situation in which we end up

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
with more hits than the maxHits. I hope that makes

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
sense, so greater than or equals, just in case we skip over

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
maxHits. And then, in that instance we are going to Destroy

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the (gameObject). So, it works! That's

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
great! What I want to do now is, pop a

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
red brick into the scene. So, I'm going to go to my Prefabs. I like

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
to do that by dropping it onto the Hierarchy, not into the scene,

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
because then it will end up somewhere

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
actually in the

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
correct place. Now, what have I done here? Why does this look weird?

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because I'm on the Start Menu Scene

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
it's indicated at the top of the screen here. Alright, common mistake,

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
so take it out of the Start Menu Scene, go into

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the level that you want to test with, yeah.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now, drag your prefab

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
into the Hierarchy, and it arrives in a predefined

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
place. That's great! I'm going to move it, holding down Control

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
or Command, to somewhere that I can hit it lots.

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There. And I'm going to test that this red brick behaves, as

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
we expect. Ready? There's not music in this

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
case, because I started directly on this scene. I'm going to

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
stop and try again, just because I can't...

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Ah, this is tedious. OK, so

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
it's quite tedious to test these things sometimes,

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but in the early days it's not a

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
bad thing to be having to test your game

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
code a lot, because you're play testing while

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you do it. So, what I'm going to do to make this easier

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
is, I'm just going to... Let's think of the

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
quickest way. Maybe the quickest way, actually, is to take my

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Top Row of bricks here and duplicate it, move it

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
up a little bit like so, and

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
then, I could replace them all.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, I'm just going to cheat. I'm not going to replace the prefabs.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm going to just set the Max Hits of the green bricks.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If I want to, I can set them to a red color as well,

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it doesn't really make any difference. I am accepting

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that my color picker refuses to stay open, so

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
let's not bother changing the color. It has changed, actually, to gray.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, these are gray bricks that have a three hit maximum.

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm actually going to put one more on the top here, just so the ball

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
can't escape, and what I'm going to aim to do is fire the ball up this

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
gap. Whoop failed! Let's try again!

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm going to try and fire up the gap, which is probably easier

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
said than done. There we go! Boom! There you go! You can

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
see, I mean I really didn't count there, but I'm pretty confident that it's three

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
hits and that after three hits it's going. And again, we're in a

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
boring loop, which we'll sort out later. Cool!

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So, I'm going to take out my extraneous top row there,

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
because it's kind of ugly, save the scene,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and that's it! That is how you destroy objects

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
when you exceed the maximum number of hits. We have more

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
work to do, but hey, this is a good piece of progress.

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So congratulations and see you soon!
