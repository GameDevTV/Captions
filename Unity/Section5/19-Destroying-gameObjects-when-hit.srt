1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000


2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey welcome back! So, in this video we're going

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to make our blocks actually be destroyed when

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the ball hits them, rather than just

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
loading a level. So, let's take a look at how we're

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
going to do that. If you pop into your Brick Script,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you'll recall that we already publicly exposed

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
a maximum hits variable. We're not using it yet.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If you look in Unity, under Prefabs

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in the Inspector against the

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
script, you'll see a maximum hits number

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
exposed there, which should already be set to 1 for the

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
yellow, meaning it's going to be destroyed immediately.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Two for green means it goes on the second hit and three for red.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, in this video what we're going to be doing

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is, discussing how the Destroy() method works,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
explaining why we destroyed

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
gameObject and not this, and then, I'm going to challenge you

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to only destroy it, when the maximum number of hits are met.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So, back into our script then.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's get rid of

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
this SimulateWin(); line, we don't need that anymore!

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's gone. What we're going to do is firstly

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
think, well what are we going to destroy? Well, I'll tell

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
you for a start that the keyword we need is Destroy. Now, let's

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
go to Unity's docs for Destroy. Here

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
they are! They're expecting to destroy an object.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's Object.Destroy, and there's no

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
example available. So, what have we got? There's

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
two possibilities, maybe. One would be this

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which is a brick, actually not an object, and another

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
would be (gameObject), which is actually what we're looking

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
for. So, you need to Destroy (gameObject);

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you try and destroy this, it won't work because this is a brick

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and (gameObject) is actually the object you're looking for.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alright, so just remember when you destroy you Destroy(gameObject);

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,300
and save your script and let's try it!

38
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Hey there, Sam here with a quick post-recording edit.

39
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,300
just to let you guys know that if you see any issues like the ball

40
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,300
carrying on regardless after it has just destroyed a brick, then

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,300
what's going on is that your brick is getting destroyed too soon

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,300
and that basically means that the ball has no time to register that it's

43
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,300
collided with the brick and so to bounce off it. So if that happens to you

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,300
the fix for this is to use OnCollisionExit instead of...

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,300
OnCollisionEnter because this means the ball will have already bounced off the brick and

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,300
at that point, you're safe to destroy the brick so if you've 

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,900
encountered that problem, just make that little tweak.

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,600


49
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Ah, that's good!

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
So, it's a start! Right now, the bricks are being destroyed. Now of course, the

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
green bricks are being destroyed on one hit, and that's because

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
we haven't told the system to do anything different

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
to that, but at least we have our first inkling of a

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
working Arkanoid clone. So congratulations

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
on that bit! Now, what I want you to do as a challenge is

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I want you to put an if statement around the

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Destroy line, line 24 on my screen, and

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
I want you to make sure that the

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,600
brick is only destroyed when you get to maximum

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
hits. So to be clear, yellow bricks should destroy immediately as they are,

61
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
but green bricks should only destroy on the second hit.

62
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
And if that's working red bricks should work as well.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
So, test that by playing. Pop a couple of red bricks

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
in the scene and make sure that all of that works. So, please

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
pause the video and put that simple if statement around

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,600
the outside of the destroy line, now.

67
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Cool and welcome back! So, this is how I'm doing it!

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm going to say, if. And I will

69
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
do my brackets and my curly brackets first. Of course, the

70
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
second curly brace needs to go under destroy.

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Now, this is only a single line code block here.

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
You can write it, if you wish, like this,

73
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
if something Destroy, but I would

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
really prefer you be in the habit of always using

75
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
code blocks, because if you do this the temptation could be

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
to do that, which is also OK.

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
If some condition Destroy the (gameObject), but then if

78
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
you go and write "some line here" that will

79
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
not get executed inside the if.

80
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
It will get executed outside of the if, i.e., this

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
"will ALWAYS BE

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
EXECUTED", because you've basically

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
indented wrongly and you should have indented like so,

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
and the if statement is separate. So look, that's all bloody

85
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
confusing! So, what I like to do is immediately

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
that I write the world if, I use

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
curly braces immediately, so

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
that I know I'm dealing with a code block. If I want to add another

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
line here, it's going to work as we expect.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Alright, so if something destroyed the GameObject, well

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
if what? Well, it's go to do with timesHit and maxHit.

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
timesHit starts at 0, so if (times

93
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Hit is = to maxHits)

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
we destroy the object, right. So, in the beginning it's 0,

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
and for the yellow block the maxHits is

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
is 1. So, this doesn't occur and it doesn't destroy,

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
and then, when it hits 1 it will

98
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
destroy. Let's test it!

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
OK, so we have:

100
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
"Cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'bool'"

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
on line 25. So, bool is to do a

102
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Boolean, it's a yes, no, true, false, and int is an Integer.

103
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
So, you double. Sorry line twenty-five

104
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
click on that error and it'll take you to the line. Another way of finding

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
the error is to go to Build and Build All, and it will show

106
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
you the error straight away. The problem is, I'm using =.

107
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
It's actually ==! You do a comparison

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
with ==. Equals itself

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
alone is an assignment. It was trying to set maxHit

110
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
into timesHit OK,

111
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
and then, the result of that was

112
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
an Integer and it was expecting a Boolean.

113
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Very confusing, so == for a comparison please.

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Let's try again!

115
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
OK, hit two

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,600
blocks at once. There you go! OK, so the yellow blocks appear to be working, but

117
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
that's not surprising, because they were working before. Now, let's see the green blocks,

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
when I finally hit one. Now, these boring play

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
loops that we can get in like this, we're going to fix those later.

120
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
For now, I'm just going to start the game again, because it got

121
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
into what I call a boring play loop. Let's just try again!

122
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
What we're aiming to do is hit a green

123
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
block, and then, see... There you go! One hit on

124
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,600
that green block. Now, to test it, I would like to hit the

125
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
same green block again, so it can be a little bit tedious, but at least

126
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
you're getting to play your game. That's interesting! I'm not

127
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,600
entirely sure which block I hit, so

128
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
you're just going to have to potentially play this a few times.

129
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
There you go! If you get it up in that gap then that's

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
great, so now we're hitting all of these blocks once. [Laughs]

131
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
It's here to test us! It doesn't want us

132
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
to see what happens if we hit a green block twice. I think

133
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
every single green block on the top there, or practically all of them got hit.

134
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
So, in a minute we're going to get our way, and we're going to get a

135
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,600
second hit on a green block. Oh no! It's here to test

136
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
my patience! Are we ever going to hit a

137
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,600
green block again! Oh wow, at last and it

138
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
gets destroyed! So it works, fantastic! That's

139
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
great news! So, what I would like to do,

140
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
rather than say == is, I would like to say

141
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
let's go greater than our =. Why?

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Well, imagine that in the future we extend the behavior

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,600
and we have some super ball or something, that has the

144
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,600
effect of hitting a brick twice. You could completely

145
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
skip the limit. You could have had one hit initially,

146
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
and then, suddenly three or four or five and then,

147
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
you would never equal it. So, if we go greater than our equals,

148
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
we're guarding against the situation in which we end up

149
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
with more hits than the maxHits. I hope that makes

150
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
sense, so greater than or equals, just in case we skip over

151
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
maxHits. And then, in that instance we are going to Destroy

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
the (gameObject). So, it works! That's

153
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
great! What I want to do now is, pop a

154
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
red brick into the scene. So, I'm going to go to my Prefabs. I like

155
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
to do that by dropping it onto the Hierarchy, not into the scene,

156
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,600
because then it will end up somewhere

157
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
actually in the

158
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
correct place. Now, what have I done here? Why does this look weird?

159
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Because I'm on the Start Menu Scene

160
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
it's indicated at the top of the screen here. Alright, common mistake,

161
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,600
so take it out of the Start Menu Scene, go into

162
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
the level that you want to test with, yeah.

163
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Now, drag your prefab

164
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
into the Hierarchy, and it arrives in a predefined

165
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
place. That's great! I'm going to move it, holding down Control

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
or Command, to somewhere that I can hit it lots.

167
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
There. And I'm going to test that this red brick behaves, as

168
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,600
we expect. Ready? There's not music in this

169
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,600
case, because I started directly on this scene. I'm going to

170
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
stop and try again, just because I can't...

171
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Ah, this is tedious. OK, so

172
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
it's quite tedious to test these things sometimes,

173
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
but in the early days it's not a

174
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
bad thing to be having to test your game

175
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
code a lot, because you're play testing while

176
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
you do it. So, what I'm going to do to make this easier

177
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
is, I'm just going to... Let's think of the

178
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
quickest way. Maybe the quickest way, actually, is to take my

179
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Top Row of bricks here and duplicate it, move it

180
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
up a little bit like so, and

181
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
then, I could replace them all.

182
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Well, I'm just going to cheat. I'm not going to replace the prefabs.

183
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm going to just set the Max Hits of the green bricks.

184
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
If I want to, I can set them to a red color as well,

185
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
it doesn't really make any difference. I am accepting

186
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
that my color picker refuses to stay open, so

187
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
let's not bother changing the color. It has changed, actually, to gray.

188
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
So, these are gray bricks that have a three hit maximum.

189
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm actually going to put one more on the top here, just so the ball

190
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
can't escape, and what I'm going to aim to do is fire the ball up this

191
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
gap. Whoop failed! Let's try again!

192
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm going to try and fire up the gap, which is probably easier

193
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
said than done. There we go! Boom! There you go! You can

194
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
see, I mean I really didn't count there, but I'm pretty confident that it's three

195
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
hits and that after three hits it's going. And again, we're in a

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
boring loop, which we'll sort out later. Cool!

197
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
So, I'm going to take out my extraneous top row there,

198
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
because it's kind of ugly, save the scene,

199
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
and that's it! That is how you destroy objects

200
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
when you exceed the maximum number of hits. We have more

201
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
work to do, but hey, this is a good piece of progress.

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
So congratulations and see you soon!
