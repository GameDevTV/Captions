00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hey! So. let's get stuck into Block Breaker! So. it's going to look

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
something like this. by the time we've finished. What are we going to do

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
this lecture? Well. let's take a look! We're going to

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
research the brick sizes. Plan our game space.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to find an appropriate image. edit up

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
our sprites. and then. create a new Unity project and

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
import our three sprites. our Whole Brick.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And then. we're also going to have a Left Hand Brick

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and a Right Hand Brick. If we look at a picture of a brick

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
wall. what do we get?

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm going to go for Images.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm going to go for Search Tools.

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Labeled for Reuse with Modification.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then. look at one of these images. So. that is entirely

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
whole bricks. That's obviously an insulated double skinned wall.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but if you look at old fashioned walls. like this. then they have

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
whole bricks and half bricks. This one over here may be a

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
better example. Whole brick. half brick. whole brick. half

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
brick. and these half bricks are actually laying side on.

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We're going to want both of these. because if you want to build

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
any sort of wall. actually. you need half bricks. because

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
otherwise how do you finish it? You don't want to stack whole

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
bricks on top of each other. it's not as strong. So. we're going

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to need some half bricks. so our mission is to make whole bricks and

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
half bricks. Decide what size we want. and then how big

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
out game space is going to be.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So. let's take a look at some examples of like previous

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Arkanoid games. How many blocks wide are they? 1. 2. 3. 4.

29
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
5. 6. 7. 8. So. I think that's going to be 16

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
or 15 blocks wide. In that example.

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
look at a different one. This one here will do.

32
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I think that's going to be 15 blocks wide. So. 15

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
or 16 blocks wide is quite nice.

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
as far as I'm concerned. So.

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
finding the right image. Typical

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Arkanoid had about 14. 15. 16 blocks.

38
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
There's a Wikipedia article on

39
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
brick images. if you care. you can look up brick sizes on

40
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Wikipedia and find out what countries have

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
different brick sizes. I'm going to pull up

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
for about an aspect ratio of

43
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
128 by 40 pixels. So.

44
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
it gives me a 3.2 aspect ratio.

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And it turns out that if you go 128 pixels

46
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
wide. then 16 blocks wide

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is the same as an iPad Air screen. 2048.

48
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
There's a little star there. because actually I'm going to need

49
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
128 by 41 or it doesn't work properly. in the grid

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
system. when we get to Unity. So. your mission is

51
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to go to Google.

52
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
type in Brick Wall. and then. look for an appropriate

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
brick wall image. Now. what's an appropriate image? Well. I said

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that on the next slide. actually. I've used

55
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Google Images. I filtered for "reuse with modification".

56
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and I'm looking for a brick that has some texture.

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that is even and that is taken from straight

58
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
on. And then. I'm going to crop that out to

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
128 by 41. so let's take a look! This

60
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
wall is even. It's taken from pretty much straight

61
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
on. although to my eye it's going down hill. It is going down hill.

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to the left. so that's not ideal. But it's got no

63
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
texture. The bricks have no texture. so they're rubbish. These ones.

64
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
plenty of texture. plenty of character. but they're too uneven

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to work in a gird system. This one here.

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
probably going to work. That type of thing would be fine. So.

67
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
if that one is going to work. let me show you how I would

68
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
doing it. View the image and save it.

69
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
somewhere. That's fine! Now. when you open

70
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that image. I'm just using Preview on a Mac. it's going to come up like this.

71
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And what I've done is I've just zoomed

72
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
in. found a brick that's

73
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
barely even and got some texture. and chopped it out like so.

74
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
taking about half the mortar on

75
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
either side. top and bottom. and then.

76
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
cropping the brick out like so. So. that's stage

77
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
1. The next stage is to Desaturate the brick. so

78
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
whatever tool you're using. turn the Saturation right down.

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
so that you can recolor the brick very easily. in the

80
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
program later. And now. it's just too dark. we want a

81
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
light brick. So. turn your Exposure up

82
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
with the appropriate Contrast. so there's not too much

83
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
detail. That's too much texture and that's too little

84
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
texture. So. you get some middle amount of texture.

85
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And then. you might want to fiddle with the image a little bit. so

86
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the mortar around the outside is a little more clear. Here we've got a

87
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
shadow. which looks funny. So. I've done this

88
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
already. and I've come up with this full brick pattern for me. which

89
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
seems to tesselate well with other bricks. The mortar isn't perfect

90
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
white and that's good. it makes it look more natural.

91
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
but it's got pretty clear mortar around the edges and it's precisely.

92
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
sizewise.

93
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
128 pixels wide

94
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
by 41 high. Excuse the weird 41.

95
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Why 41 instead of 40? I actually don't know

96
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
why that works out. I was aiming for

97
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
128 divided by 40. which gives you a nice even 3.2

98
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
aspect ratio. You'll see why that matters

99
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
in Unity later. For some reason. we need an extra pixel. So. for the sharp

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
students. maybe when we get to that bit you can write

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
on the discussions and tell my why. I don't know why.

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So. the next thing we need to do. once we've got an entire brick like this.

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
a whole brick is... Let's just look at the slides.

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So. we desaturate

105
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
it so we can change its color later and we have.

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
The texture makes the bricks look better. You'll see that when we

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
get them into Unity. We want to create

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
new images for left and right bricks. so I showed you

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
left and right bricks. Let's now show you how we do new

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
images for those. So. what I've done is I've just cropped

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
at precisely 64 by 41 pixels.

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
There. half of it. copy that.

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and make a new image from the clip board.

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And what you get here is something that's nearly what we need.

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
That's nearly a right brick. The problem is. if you put this

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
right brick against another brick. it's going to look horrible because it's got no mortar

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
on the left. So. a very easy way to get mortar on the left

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
is to copy the mortar that's already there.

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
two pixels of it just two pixels.

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
copy and paste it back onto the image. and just put it on the left hand side.

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And that actually works out really well! That is now

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
a pretty good right hand half brick. So. what I want you to do is

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
save yourself a right hand half brick. that's my one.

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and a left hand half brick

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and a full brick. So. the full brick is 128 by

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
41. Obviously the left brick is 64 by 41.

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and the right brick will be the same dimensions.

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So. save all three of those. which is a great

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
start. and ensure the mortar looks

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
half descent. You can always adjust these later OK.

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
so you don't have to get these looking right just now. How do you know

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
what looking right means. until you start placing

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
blocks next to each other. So. don't stress. just get your first version of you

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
images. and then. once they're in Unity

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
you can adjust them very easily and they will instantly update.

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So next. we're going to create a new project and

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
import our bricks. So. we're going to go into

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Unity. Here's a challenge for you! Just go into Unity. create a new project.

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
call it Block Breaker. and then. I want you to import all three

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
brick images into a folder called Sprites.

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And then. save your scene as Level_01.

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
in Scenes. So. go ahead and do

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
what's on the screen now. Pause the video and come back when

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
you've done that. and I'll show you how I did it.

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Alright. none of this is rocket science. Let's get over

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to Unity. If you're anything like me. you'll still

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
have Number Wizard UI opened. You may not. it doesn't matter.

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The point is we're going to create a new project. It's a

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
2D project.

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We decide where we want it. In my case. in my

151
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
repositories. I'm going to create a new folder called Block

152
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Breaker. This will then go at the same level as all of these. I'm

153
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
selected on Repos. I'm calling it Block Breaker.

154
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and it'll go at this level. No packages.

155
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
2D. Create Project.

156
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Unity will restart.

157
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Fantastic! Now. I want to go and get my images. so where are they?

158
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
In my case. they're in my Finder. and

159
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that's a good question.

160
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
You will find them. from the downloads. I have them in

161
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
my prototype here.

162
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Sprites. And I want the right brick. the

163
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
left brick. and the full brick. and I want to bring those into

164
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Unity. Fine! Then.

165
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
you're going to create yourself a folder and call it Sprites.

166
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Pop them in. to be neat from the beginning.

167
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Make a new folder.

168
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I call mine underscore Scenes. because

169
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
_Scenes is a folder we're going to access very frequently.

170
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and scenes. sprites. and scripts end up looking so

171
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
similar that this is a great way of keeping them separate.

172
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The final thing to do is just save. because we have an untitled scene.

173
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So. you save. File and Save. What are

174
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
we going to call it? Well. I'm going to call mine Level_01. the first level.

175
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The very final thing is. you put Level_01

176
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
into the _Scenes Folder. and there we go. we have

177
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
_Scenes with Level_01 in it.

178
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We have Sprites

179
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
with our three sprites in it. our whole

180
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
brick. our left brick. and our right brick.

181
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and we're good to go! We can save the scene.

182
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It's already done! Save the project if we like. and

183
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
we're in good shape! So congratulations. you have

184
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
done everything that we needed to do. and we are ready to start

185
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.833
building blocks!

=======

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey! So, let's get stuck into Block Breaker! So, it's going to look

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
something like this, by the time we've finished. What are we going to do

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
this lecture? Well, let's take a look! We're going to

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
research the brick sizes. Plan our game space.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to find an appropriate image, edit up

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
our sprites, and then, create a new Unity project and

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
import our three sprites, our Whole Brick.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then, we're also going to have a Left Hand Brick

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and a Right Hand Brick. If we look at a picture of a brick

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
wall, what do we get?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm going to go for Images.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to go for Search Tools,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Labeled for Reuse with Modification,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and then, look at one of these images. So, that is entirely

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
whole bricks. That's obviously an insulated double skinned wall,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but if you look at old fashioned walls, like this, then they have

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
whole bricks and half bricks. This one over here may be a

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
better example. Whole brick, half brick, whole brick, half

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
brick, and these half bricks are actually laying side on.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're going to want both of these, because if you want to build

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
any sort of wall, actually, you need half bricks, because

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
otherwise how do you finish it? You don't want to stack whole

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
bricks on top of each other, it's not as strong. So, we're going

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to need some half bricks, so our mission is to make whole bricks and

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
half bricks. Decide what size we want, and then how big

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
out game space is going to be.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So, let's take a look at some examples of like previous

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Arkanoid games. How many blocks wide are they? 1, 2, 3, 4,

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
5, 6, 7, 8. So, I think that's going to be 16

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
or 15 blocks wide. In that example,

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
look at a different one. This one here will do.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think that's going to be 15 blocks wide. So, 15

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
or 16 blocks wide is quite nice,

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
as far as I'm concerned. So,

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
finding the right image. Typical

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Arkanoid had about 14, 15, 16 blocks.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's a Wikipedia article on

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
brick images, if you care, you can look up brick sizes on

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wikipedia and find out what countries have

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
different brick sizes. I'm going to pull up

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
for about an aspect ratio of

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
128 by 40 pixels. So,

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it gives me a 3.2 aspect ratio.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it turns out that if you go 128 pixels

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
wide, then 16 blocks wide

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
is the same as an iPad Air screen, 2048.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There's a little star there, because actually I'm going to need

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
128 by 41 or it doesn't work properly, in the grid

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
system, when we get to Unity. So, your mission is

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to go to Google,

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
type in Brick Wall, and then, look for an appropriate

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
brick wall image. Now, what's an appropriate image? Well, I said

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that on the next slide, actually. I've used

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Google Images, I filtered for "reuse with modification",

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and I'm looking for a brick that has some texture,

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that is even and that is taken from straight

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
on. And then, I'm going to crop that out to

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
128 by 41, so let's take a look! This

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
wall is even. It's taken from pretty much straight

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
on, although to my eye it's going down hill. It is going down hill,

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
to the left, so that's not ideal. But it's got no

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
texture. The bricks have no texture, so they're rubbish. These ones,

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
plenty of texture, plenty of character, but they're too uneven

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to work in a gird system. This one here,

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
probably going to work. That type of thing would be fine. So,

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
if that one is going to work, let me show you how I would

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
doing it. View the image and save it,

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
somewhere. That's fine! Now, when you open

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
that image, I'm just using Preview on a Mac, it's going to come up like this.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And what I've done is I've just zoomed

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
in, found a brick that's

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
barely even and got some texture, and chopped it out like so,

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
taking about half the mortar on

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
either side, top and bottom, and then,

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
cropping the brick out like so. So, that's stage

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
1. The next stage is to Desaturate the brick, so

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
whatever tool you're using, turn the Saturation right down,

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so that you can recolor the brick very easily, in the

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
program later. And now, it's just too dark, we want a

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
light brick. So, turn your Exposure up

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
with the appropriate Contrast, so there's not too much

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
detail. That's too much texture and that's too little

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
texture. So, you get some middle amount of texture.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then, you might want to fiddle with the image a little bit, so

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the mortar around the outside is a little more clear. Here we've got a

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
shadow, which looks funny. So, I've done this

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
already, and I've come up with this full brick pattern for me, which

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
seems to tesselate well with other bricks. The mortar isn't perfect

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
white and that's good, it makes it look more natural,

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
but it's got pretty clear mortar around the edges and it's precisely,

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
sizewise,

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
128 pixels wide

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
by 41 high. Excuse the weird 41.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why 41 instead of 40? I actually don't know

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
why that works out. I was aiming for

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
128 divided by 40, which gives you a nice even 3.2

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
aspect ratio. You'll see why that matters

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
in Unity later. For some reason, we need an extra pixel. So, for the sharp

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
students, maybe when we get to that bit you can write

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
on the discussions and tell my why. I don't know why.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So, the next thing we need to do, once we've got an entire brick like this,

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
a whole brick is... Let's just look at the slides.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So, we desaturate

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
it so we can change its color later and we have.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The texture makes the bricks look better. You'll see that when we

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
get them into Unity. We want to create

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
new images for left and right bricks, so I showed you

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
left and right bricks. Let's now show you how we do new

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
images for those. So, what I've done is I've just cropped

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
at precisely 64 by 41 pixels.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There, half of it, copy that,

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and make a new image from the clip board.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And what you get here is something that's nearly what we need.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's nearly a right brick. The problem is, if you put this

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
right brick against another brick, it's going to look horrible because it's got no mortar

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
on the left. So, a very easy way to get mortar on the left

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is to copy the mortar that's already there,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
two pixels of it just two pixels,

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
copy and paste it back onto the image, and just put it on the left hand side.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And that actually works out really well! That is now

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
a pretty good right hand half brick. So, what I want you to do is

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
save yourself a right hand half brick, that's my one,

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and a left hand half brick

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and a full brick. So, the full brick is 128 by

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
41. Obviously the left brick is 64 by 41,

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and the right brick will be the same dimensions.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, save all three of those, which is a great

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
start, and ensure the mortar looks

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
half descent. You can always adjust these later OK,

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
so you don't have to get these looking right just now. How do you know

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
what looking right means, until you start placing

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
blocks next to each other. So, don't stress, just get your first version of you

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
images, and then, once they're in Unity

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you can adjust them very easily and they will instantly update.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So next, we're going to create a new project and

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
import our bricks. So, we're going to go into

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Unity. Here's a challenge for you! Just go into Unity, create a new project,

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
call it Block Breaker, and then, I want you to import all three

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
brick images into a folder called Sprites.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then, save your scene as Level_01,

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in Scenes. So, go ahead and do

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
what's on the screen now. Pause the video and come back when

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you've done that, and I'll show you how I did it.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Alright, none of this is rocket science. Let's get over

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
to Unity. If you're anything like me, you'll still

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
have Number Wizard UI opened. You may not, it doesn't matter.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The point is we're going to create a new project. It's a

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
2D project.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We decide where we want it. In my case, in my

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
repositories. I'm going to create a new folder called Block

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Breaker. This will then go at the same level as all of these. I'm

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
selected on Repos, I'm calling it Block Breaker,

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and it'll go at this level. No packages,

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
2D, Create Project.

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Unity will restart.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Fantastic! Now, I want to go and get my images, so where are they?

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In my case, they're in my Finder, and

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that's a good question.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You will find them, from the downloads, I have them in

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
my prototype here,

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sprites. And I want the right brick, the

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
left brick, and the full brick, and I want to bring those into

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Unity. Fine! Then,

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you're going to create yourself a folder and call it Sprites.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Pop them in, to be neat from the beginning.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Make a new folder.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I call mine underscore Scenes, because

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
_Scenes is a folder we're going to access very frequently,

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and scenes, sprites, and scripts end up looking so

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
similar that this is a great way of keeping them separate.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The final thing to do is just save, because we have an untitled scene.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, you save, File and Save. What are

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
we going to call it? Well, I'm going to call mine Level_01, the first level.

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The very final thing is, you put Level_01

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
into the _Scenes Folder, and there we go, we have

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
_Scenes with Level_01 in it.

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We have Sprites

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
with our three sprites in it, our whole

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
brick, our left brick, and our right brick,

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and we're good to go! We can save the scene.

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's already done! Save the project if we like, and

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
we're in good shape! So congratulations, you have

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
done everything that we needed to do, and we are ready to start

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,833
building blocks!
