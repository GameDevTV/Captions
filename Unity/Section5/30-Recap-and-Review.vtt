1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So congratulations, you've finished

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Block Breaker! Well done! You've learned a huge amount there

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
across the spectrum. Hopefully, you've started to make your own levels

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
already alright, Brice. We'd like to see them do that. Yeah, we want to see

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
what you're creating. We want to see all of the innovation you're going to bring

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to those levels. You can make your own

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
bricks, create your own designs,

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
use the walls for good effects. You can have interesting non-breakable,

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you know indestructible, bricks to make

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
patterns. Make cool stuff, basically!

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Absolutely! And it doesn't have to be a square play space. You can make an arch,

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you can do what you like, so mess around with it. Be a bit careful if you use

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
commercial music. Of course, commercial tracks sound the best, as you're

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
backing music. I don't care if you use that for yourself

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and for sharing with your friends, but just be careful. Don't try and sell it,

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
don't put it out to public with commercial music in it.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Images actually, if you're going to be using an image, make sure

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you own the right to that image, if you're going to be sharing it or selling it.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Absolutely! And I don't know how much you can

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
rely on it, but I tend to use the option in Google Image Search, that says

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
look for images that you can use for modification with

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
reuse. You've seen that in the course.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And then, when you've done it and you've built your levels, share them with others.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Please we want to see them. We definitely want to see what you're going to be creating. And get together

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
with a friend maybe, and help them to help you make

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a level. Maybe you've got a really artistic friend or an autistic friend,

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and get them to sit down and make the level with you. And

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
lay it out, and they don't need to know anything about the coding,

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
they can just use the Unity Editor. We'll see you

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.866
in the next section! Bye for now! See you soon!
