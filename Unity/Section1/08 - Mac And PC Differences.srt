00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:06,090
OK, let's talk about the difference between
the Unity versions on Mac and PC. So, here

00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,110
it is on the PC again, looking a little fuzzy
a little strange, because what you're seeing

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,879
here is the outer window, which includes my
team viewer which is the way that I'm logging

00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,130
into a PC, but anyway, don't worry about that.
This is the version on the PC that you can

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,500
see here, that you're becoming familiar with,
and then, I have here the Mac version. It

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
looks very similar of course, now there are
some differences. I just want to show you

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,110
the differences, because most of this course
is actually recorded on a Mac. So, let's flip

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,489
back again, hardly any difference, you're
seeing some font differences, that's the main

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,620
thing really. The title bar is a smaller font
on the Mac, but the Unity Menu, and this is

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,879
what normally causes confusion, on a Mac you
have a Unity Menu with About Unity, Preferences,

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,579
Modules, Manage Licenses, they're are the
four main things. Well, those things are split

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,289
out on the PC, into the Help Menu and the
Edit Menu, so if you're looking for About

00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:02,309
Unity or Manage License, on a PC, you go to
Help and then, you get... sorry, you go to

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,170
Help within Unity and you get About Unity
and Manage License. On the Mac, where you

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,860
have the Unity Menu and you have Preferences
and Modules, well on the PC, that's under

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,310
Edit and then you have Preferences and Modules,
so that's the main thing. Now, I want to show

00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,930
you some differences in MonoDevelop, so I'm
going to create... You don't need to do this,

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,900
by the way. ...create this script, but I'm
just going to create a new script. I'm going

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,740
to open MonoDevelop on the PC. Sorry that
it's a bit fuzzy, it's just the screen resolution.

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,810
Now, here it is on the PC, and then, let's
have a go over into the Mac and do a very

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,470
similar thing in the Project Window. In fact,
I've already got a script here. I'm going

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,659
to let it open. Basically what I'm trying
to tell you is that they're very very similar

00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:52,530
indeed. So, here on the Mac is my MonoDevelop.
Now, just because I don't have the left hand

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,040
column open, the left hand view, I could be
bringing in a pad on the left hand side; I

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,619
think it's called the solution pad, there
you. And then, that makes it look very similar

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:07,210
to the PC version, which is just for reference
back here. OK, so they look very similar and

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,160
they act very similar, so you have slightly
different menus in MonoDevelop. On the PC

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,650
you may need to go to Tools and Options, whereas
on the Mac for MonoDevelop, you might well

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,200
be needing to go to MonoDevelop, Preferences.
OK, so not much difference, just the difference

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,550
in which menu you first go to, otherwise we're
talking about two very very similar beasts.

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,830
So, hopefully you won't have any problem following
along this course, given that we are generally

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,510
using the Mac version, even though you are
in the PC version. OK, so that's that. Good

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,360
luck! Have a quick explore, make sure whichever
platform you're on you know where to find

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,250
things. Have a look for the Help Menu the
Edit Menu, etc., and then, I'm sure you'll

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,630
be able to make the translation now. OK, congratulations!
I'll see you soon!
