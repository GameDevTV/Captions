00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.540
Hello and welcome back! In this video we're
going to be going over how to ask good questions.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.770
So. what's the first thing? Well. that's what
we're going to be going over. And why is it

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.390
important and why are we doing this? We now
have over 22.000 students on the course and

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.939
we want to make it easy for everybody to get
their questions answered. We can't get to

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.759
all of the questions that are going to come
up. so we want to make sure that every time

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.890
you ask a question it's easy for other students
to answer it as well. You'll also find that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.320
the process of asking a good question will
often solve the original problem. before you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.570
even press the post button. Asking good questions
is useful and it'll be appreciated. if you're

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.960
ever in a work environment or even in school.
back in school. asking a good question is

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.080
useful. So. what's the first thing? The first
thing is we want good admin. We want to make

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.330
sure that your question can be found and that
we can know when to pay attention to them

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.780
and when not to pay attention to them. So.
always mark your question with [Help] or [Solved].

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.340
at the beginning of the title. if you have
no other way of showing that a question has

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.000
been solved. So. for example. if you go to
a specific question and answer forum. like

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.960
Stack Overflow. you'll find that they have
mechanisms in place to show that the question

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.790
has been answered or not. We don't in our
forums on Udemy and many forums don't. so

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.190
it's always useful to add in the beginning
of the title of your question. to make sure

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.940
that you say [Help] or [Solved]. so that people
don't have to worry about looking at questions

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.170
that have already been solved. Also. use clear
descriptive titles and correct grammar and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.140
punctuation and full sentences. when you're
actually asking the question. Those things

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.840
are important to make it easy to understand
what you're talking about. easy to find the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.720
problem. and easy to parse. because we have
some none. even for none native speakers of

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.240
English. who will find it much easier to parse
full sentences than abbreviations or partial

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.860
sentences. So. that's the first one. have
good admin when you when you give a question.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.549
and don't forget to mark it as [Solved]. once
the question has been answered. So. you need

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.570
to write a good description. and that means
you need to describe the problem thoroughly.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.690
and the best way to do that is actually something
from programming and from software engineering.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.859
is just format it as a Bug Report. So. there's
things in the Bug Report that you need to

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:21.219
include are observed Behavior: What you saw happen.
Expected Behavior: How the Observed Behavior

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.180
differed from the Expected Behavior. what
you want to happen. and then. the Steps to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.819
Reproduce the actual occurrence. So. how would
you reproduce the problem. to that step to

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.730
that situation. so that you can reproduce
it on say my machine or on somebody else's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.730
machine? And then. there are lists of things
you have tried out already. so that we don't

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.969
duplicate our efforts by having somebody who
wants to answer you question trying out things

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:49.239
you've already done. Now make sure you include
all the relevant information. that includes

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.709
the errors and the warning in full. If you
have errors and warnings. add them in full.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.279
Include the version information for the products
you're using. in our case it's going to be

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:03.120
Unity. It's quite important. version information
matters a lot. Different versions will have

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.809
different programming API. so that means they
a have different way of doing the same thing.

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:12.230
and we need to know which version to look
at to answer your question. Make sure you

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.969
use screenshots generously. to show the problem.
Take some screenshots of both the entire window.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:22.510
so that we can see your Inspector and your
Hierarchy. those are important information.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.569
when you've got an object selected. as well
as a smaller screenshot of the problem your

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.730
having itself. Sometimes a screenshot isn't
appropriate. it's not suitable. use your judgement

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.949
to see whether you should use a screenshot.
In most of the cases. if you've got a visual

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.689
problem in the game a screenshot will always
help and it never hurts. Use a code hosting

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:47.499
service. That's another really good tip. Not
many general purpose forums are good to share

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:54.010
code on. In Udemy. at least the coding sharing
is OK for one line or two. but it really breaks

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.099
down when you have any more code to share.
It's really not designed for sharing code.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:04.339
so use the right tool for the right job. Use
pastebin.com or gist.github.com to share your

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:08.269
code. It's all going to be syntax highlighted.
Make sure you post complete files. Often we'll

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.189
find that a student has had an issue on one
line. but actually. it's a syntax error that

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.060
the student made five lines earlier. Make
sure to include the complete file. however

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.360
you don't want people to read your entire
file. Point them at the line that you think

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.000
is the problem. If there's an error message.
the line on which the error occurs should

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.759
be available to you and you should point people
directly to that line. Screenshots are a reasonable

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.840
alternative for code. so for example. automatic
syntax highlighting can help guide you. and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.500
if you have a problem with that it's much
easier to take a screenshot of the automatic

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.400
syntax highlighting in MonoDevelop or whatever
IDE you're using. than it is to see the same

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.580
problem in a different editor online. So.
that's when a screenshot is a reasonable alternative.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.050
Build a minimum viable test case. That's a
really useful tool. Essentially you don't

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.110
want any code in the code you're going to
be sharing with someone else to not be relevant

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.240
to your problem directly. So. code does lots
of stuff. You'll have a file that does a bunch

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.330
of different things and your problem will be
with only one aspect of that code. You really want

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.639
to make sure that the entire code that you're
going to be sharing with somebody else is

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.080
only the code relevant to the problem. You
need to make sure that what you're sharing

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.620
still exhibits the problem. alright and still
has the problem. so it's a fully working piece

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.629
of code that only includes code that's relevant
to your problem. It's a lot easier to reason

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.169
about small code samples than large ones.
and it's easier for other people to find the

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:45.509
problem as well. So. the golden rule is write
a question the way you'd like to be asked.

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:50.939
and don't ask till you've tried 3 different
things to solve the problem yourself. So.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.949
in order to show you what I mean in practice.
let's show you how I would write a bug report

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:02.639
for a problem I have in Unity. So. let's jump
into Unity and take a look. So. I'm in Unity

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.370
and my problem I have right now is I've got
this object. this cube. I want it to turn

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.949
red whenever the ball goes through it. so
let me press play and show you what I mean.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.090
Right now. the ball goes straight through
it. but the cube doesn't turn read. however

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.800
I've written some code in my ChangeOnCollision
function. right here that should be changing

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.930
the code red. and I'm not quite sure why it's
not working. So. I want to write a question

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.530
to the Udemy forums. to get some help from
other students. So. the first thing I'm going

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.120
to do is I'm going to jump into my Udemy forums.
right here. and I'm going to start creating

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.710
a new discussion. So. I'm going to click Add
Discussion and give a useful title for my

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.259
discussion. So. the first thing I want to
write is [Help]. I want to make sure this

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.189
question has not been resolved yet. so I'm
putting [Help].&nbsp;When it has been resolved.

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.479
when I'm done I will put [Solved] instead
of help. I will edit my question. change it.

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.389
Right now. I'm just going to put... and give
it a useful English description title. which

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:16.150
is going to be "Cannot change the material
color from inside OnTriggerEnter function.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:23.879
Now. don't worry about the technical details
of this question. It's basically irrelevant.

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:28.319
I just want to show you the process of writing
a good question. rather than the technical

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:34.789
details. right. These technical details. you're
not expected to know what they are. what they

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:38.789
mean. but you should get the idea of how to
write a good question. the kind of structure

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:44.469
it should have. So. I'm writing a good title.
so rather than doing that. I'm actually going

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:48.849
to ask a question. So. I'm going to say "How
to change the material color from inside the

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:58.490
OnTriggerEnter function? Cool. now I start to write the description of my function So. the first thing
I want to do is describe what my overall goal

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:11.629
is. so that people know where I'm going with
this. [Background Music Plays] Now. we can

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:21.129
say. what's the observed behavior? [Background
Music Plays] Now. I can write the desired

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:29.330
behavior. [Background Music Plays] So. this
is quite a visual problem. so let's add a

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.520
screenshot of what we mean. Let's jump back
into Unity and add a good screenshot. To do

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.070
that. I'm going to press play and pause immediately.
and I'm going to step through the program.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.960
Here we go. now we can see from the game that
the two are intersecting. but I'm not getting

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.830
a color change. So. now I'm going to take
a screenshot of that. of the entire game.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.290
while I've got my cube selected. So. I've
got a shortcut to take a screenshot. On a

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.640
Mac that's Command. Shift. 3. Use whatever
screenshot tool you want. that's not very

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:04.270
relevant. Now. I can jump back into my game.
add a screenshot just before observed. and

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:10.540
click insert image. choose the file. go into
my screenshots. I've got a bunch here. select

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:17.450
the latest one. wait for it to load. and here
we are. Now. we have a screenshot of our problem.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:23.280
in our question. so that people know what
we're talking about. Let's write a little

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.720
bit more about it in our description. What
else do we have? We have observed. desired

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:42.940
steps to reproduce. [Background Music Plays]
Make sure it's spelled properly. you can see

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:51.720
that my browser is highlighting my errors.
I've got color. the American spelling for

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.330
color. I'm going to stick with the American
spelling for now. that's fine. And now. I'm

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:02.640
going to write down my version number. so
I make sure I include that information. so

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:10.970
relevant information. Firstly. my Unity version
and I can find that out by going to my Unity

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:18.370
Editor. going to File or rather to About Unity.
It might be in a different place on the Windows

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:26.400
Unity version. and I can see here that I've
got 4.6.3f1. Jump back into Chrome. make sure

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:38.470
Unity 4.6.3f1 and the code. so let me add
a link to the code. Code for the cube. and

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:44.820
then. I can jump back into MonoDevelop and
grab the code. Now. you're not expected to

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.760
read this code. but I will tell you not all
of this is relevant to our problem. so let's

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.700
remove all the stuff that's not relevant to
our problem. that could not cause the problem.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.880
because it's completely irrelevant. So. this
stuff. for example. is irrelevant. This function

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.350
is completely irrelevant. so we can remove
it completely. and this line is now redundant.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:07.830
so remove that. That is the complete code
we want. and we can get rid of comments that

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:14.670
have no use. So. save this. make sure that
the behavior is still the problematic one.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.540
so let's pause. start the game again to show
that it still occurs. Yes it does. the bug

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.730
still occurs. We're expecting this cube to
turn red but it isn't. Then. we can jump back

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:32.630
into our code. select all of it. copy it.
and go back into our web browser and go to

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:38.020
a gist or a pastebin and paste the code in
here. Make sure we have the right language

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.630
for the selected; we want C# for Unity code.
and let's write the name of the file. which

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:52.870
is going to be ChangeOnCollision.cs. And I'm
going to create a public gist. and I'm going

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.520
to be taken straight to my gist. And then.
I can select the URL. copy the URL. and paste

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.700
it in my question. So. let's jump back into
the question and add it. Now. you'll note

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.820
that the URL isn't a link by default. it doesn't
automatically translate URL's to links. so

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:13.500
I need to link this to the destination as
well so I click link. insert link. paste our

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:19.600
link. and that should do the trick. Now. what
else do we need? What is the final bit of

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.580
information that we need? We need to add what
we've already tried. so that people won't

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:31.570
waste their time trying the same things. So.
I add this and then Steps Tried Already. and

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:48.220
then. I can say add a list. [Background Music
Plays] Etc. etc. So. now we've got a full

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.190
question. a question which has a description.
has a screenshot to show what's going wrong.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.140
has the observed and desired behavior. and
the steps to reproduce it. and the relevant

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.220
information. including the code and link to
the code. hosted on a nice service where it's

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:05.860
all going to be syntax highlighted. And that
is a good question. and if you see this question.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.010
I will post it and it will ask me to make
sure to proceed. It might now do that for

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.280
you. and then. we should see our question
in the discussions right here. Now. it is

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.200
good practice to instead of asking a question
in the general discussion. like I've just

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.760
done. ask it against a particular lecture.
You'll be in the lecture. you'll be able to

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.720
ask the question against the lecture. so we
can know which lecture you're currently on

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.640
and currently working from. Now. this is a
complete question and whenever somebody replies.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:40.700
so let me add a reply. [Background Music Plays]
Alright. so now I've got my answer. somebody's

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:50.160
answered my question. I will go back to my
question. go edit. and turn [Help] into [Solved] and save

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:57.110
And now. when people scroll by all the discussions.
they will see that this discussion has already

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:01.360
been solved. and they no longer need to pay
any attention to it. because the problem has

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:09.240
been resolved. OK. so that is it for now.
for how to ask questions on Udemy. about this

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.630
course and every forum. and really there's
a secret to this. The secret is asking questions

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:19.240
like this makes it more likely that you will
find a solution yourself. In fact. asking

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.290
questions like this. having a thorough well
thought out description. with all the relevant

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.390
information. means most of the time you'll
solve the question yourself and you will learn

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:32.950
something about it. So. actually asking good
questions makes you better at being a programmer

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.950
or being a developer. so that's the secret.
The secret is good questions help you learn.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.240
And finally. there are some great resources
on how to ask a good question. that are very

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.680
thorough. How to ask on Stack Overflow is
a great one. it's very concentrated and very

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.450
focused. Jon Skeet's "Writing the Perfect
Question" is also very good. He spends a lot

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.330
of time answering questions on Stack Overflow.
and he has a very good idea of what makes

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:01.010
a good question. And finally. "How to Ask
Questions the Smart Way" is a really long

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:06.300
form resource that covers a lot of the topics
we've gone through today. as well as many

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.920
more. and it's an exceptionally good read.
Value for money. in terms of reading this.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.100
the time you're going to spend vs. the time
you'll save in the future is huge. So. that's

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:20.620
it. I hope you now know how to ask great questions.
and you'll find it a lot easier to find help.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.630
on Udemy but also elsewhere. Best of luck
and I will see you in the next video! Bye.
