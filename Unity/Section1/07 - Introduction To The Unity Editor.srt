00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.820
Hi guys. Brice here. and welcome to your introduction
to the Unity Editor! So. without further ado

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.940
let's just straight in and have a look at
the home for the course. the home we're going

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.930
to be taking for the course. So. let's jump
into our Unity Editor. and this is what you'll

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.230
be confronted with in an existing game. So.
this is an existing game and we have something

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.689
on the screen already. There' s a whole bunch
of stuff and this can sometimes be a little

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.480
bit overwhelming. if you're not used to it.
So. let's break it down and let's look at

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.129
the key elements of the editor. so that you
feel a little bit more comfortable having

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.249
a look at your games. So firstly. I want you
to notice the very top of the window has three

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.079
different things. it has three different things
separated by dashes. Now. the first thing

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.179
is the scene you're in. so a game can have
multiple scenes multiple dungeons. multiple

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.800
rooms. those kind of things. and you can break
those down into scenes in Unity and the first

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.200
thing you can see in the top window. the Window
Title. is the scene itself. And then. secondly

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.090
is the name of the game. so this game is called
Laser Defender. that's the game we're currently

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.900
editing and currently working on. So. by looking
at the top of your window. you'll know immediately

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.830
which game you're working on and what scene
you're working on. in that game. And finally.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.580
PC. Mac. Linux. that's just what you're going
to be building game against. so we're currently

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.900
building a PC. Mac. and Linux game. Now. the
first thing we want to do when we hit the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.080
game. is to play. We want to try and see what
it does and how we can have a look at the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.070
game. and we can do that by just simply pressing
the play button. at the top center of our

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.760
screen. So. if we press the play button. we
shall see that the game comes up in the Game

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.020
Window. so we have a Game Pane and the Game
Pane turns up with the game in it. So. that's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.840
the first thing we can do. Now. if your editor
for any reason doesn't quite look like that.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.990
if it looks like something else. you can always
go at the top right of your Unity window and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.430
go to reset it to Default. You'll have a bunch
of different options. you have 2 by 3. 4 Split.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.860
Default. Tall. and Wide. that are already
baked in. and those are just different views

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.890
and different layouts of the Editor for designing
your games. You already have a bunch of default

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.859
layers. some of them are better for one monitor.
some of them are better for two monitors.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.299
and you can play around with that. And the
point is if you ever no longer find your way

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.599
around the editor and you're not sure where
you are and how everything is positioned.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.499
you can always go back to reset you layout
to Default. so that's what you can do. Now.

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:41.030
next is how do we play the game. but right
now. it's only a small pane. We want to be

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.269
able to see the game in its glory. like cover
most of the screen. So. if we click on the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.900
Game Pane. so you'll notice there's in the
center top there's a scene in the Game Pane.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.450
so if we click on the Game Pane. and there's
a button on the right top of the Game Pane.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.370
called Maximize on Play. If we click that
and play it again. you'll see that the game

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.269
will take up a majority of the real-estate
on the screen. so you'll get a face full of

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.150
game. and it's a lot easier to see what you're
doing in the game itself. when you Maximize

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.769
on Play. Now. you can remove Maximize on Play.
by just clicking it again. Now. you have a

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.099
Game and a Scene Tab. and the difference between
the two is the Game Tab is what your player

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.310
is going to see and the Scene Tab is what
is actually in your game. And you can see

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.749
they look radically different for us. the
Scene Tab and the Game Tab. And that's just

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.239
because we've put in a bunch of objects in
our scene. that are not necessarily visible

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.889
to the player. So. that's the Scene Tab. that's
the thing you are going to be editing and

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:41.010
working in. and the Game Tab is what you're
going to be previewing the game in. Now. you'll

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.529
know something. when I press play. I don't
know whether many of you have noticed it.

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.459
but the entire Editor goes a little bit darker.
Now. the reason for that is called the Play

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.109
Mode Tint. and the reason we have a Play Mode
Tint is. whenever we've got a game player.

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.599
changes we make to the game are not persistent.
They're not going to persist beyond a single

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.029
play session. so if I started modifying my
game now. which I could do. I could go into

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:09.109
my scene. modify things around. let's say
select an object and move it around. that's

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.120
not going to persist beyond my play session.
So. when I stop playing again all my changes

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.900
have been reverted back. So. in order to show
us that. we've going to use a Play Mode Tint.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.250
so right now. it's very light gray. What we're
actually going to do is go into File. or rather

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.789
Unity Preferences. in Windows it might be
somewhere else. have a dig through your menus

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.780
to find the Preferences or Options Menu. And
you go to your Preferences and you'll go to

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.240
Colors and find the Play Mode Tint. and here
you want to find a color that's going to be

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.150
disgusting enough and noticeable enough that
you really can't miss it. So. let's try this

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.020
pale green. play the game. and now you can
definitely see that the Editor is in Play

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.370
Mode. and when it's in Play Mode the changes
will not be persistent. So. that's really

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.900
useful to note. because otherwise you can
often make mistakes and not be quite sure

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.229
why your changes have been lost. when in fact.
it's just because you made them in Play Mode.

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.810
So. now let's get started with creating our
first project. So. let's go to File. go to

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.479
New Project. and I want you to do that in
your Editor too actually. if you can follow

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.120
along now. Instead of just having a look at
a project that we've already made. you're

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.620
going to create a new project. too. Now. we're
going to call this project something like

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.080
Number Wizard. in preparation for the next
section. Number Wizard. and we're going to

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.909
select a default for 2D. So. you'll notice
there's a drop-down. you can choose between

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:42.520
2D and 3D. You want to choose 2D for Number
Wizard. and then. let's go click Create Project.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.900
And here we go. now we're back in our brand
new project. for Number Wizard. So. now let's

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.669
create the new scene. You'll see at the very
top of your window. there's untitled. that's

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.849
because you're not currently in a scene. So.
to create a new scene. what we're going to

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.509
do is we're going to go to File and then Save
scene. It'll come up with a name. we're going

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.569
to call our scene Game. with a capital G.
so Game scene. and you'll see something appears

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.159
in the Assets Folder in the Project Pane.
So. you've got the Project Pane on the bottom

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.300
and you've got the Assets Folder and Game
appears in the Assets Folder.Now the next thing

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.449
I want you to see is. how to move panes around.
so you can click on a pane and you can move

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:29.370
it around. and it'll snap intelligently to
different areas of your screen. So. you can

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.590
also detach it. this is now in detach mode.
and reattach it. this is now in reattach mode.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.300
I want you to grab the Console. which is the
thing I'm currently moving. from the bottom

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.990
left pane. to be on the right hand side pane.
so add the Console to your right hand side.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.900
This is the layout we want you to use for
the next section of the course. Right. so

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.740
next bit is the modes. and just to give you
a short introduction to the modes. you have

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.849
a bunch of buttons at the top left hand side
of your Editor and they do different things

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:04.789
and let you do different things inside the
Game Space. So. in particular the first mode

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:09.409
will let you move things around or move the
entire Game Space around. where the second

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:17.949
mode will actually let you move objects around
instead. So. the first mode moves the entire

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:23.590
area. the entire scene. the second mode moves
individual objects. the third mode rotates.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.699
fourth mode scales. and the fifth one is for
UI elements. so the User Interface. And that

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:34.250
is basically it. you can also switch those
modes by Q. W. E. R. and T. by using your

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.530
keyboard. and that's basically it for our
introduction to Unity. I hope you'll find

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.960
it useful. and I hope it wasn't too overwhelming.
We'll go through it step by step and you'll

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.840
learn a lot more about all the things that
you can do with Unity. in future lectures.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.929
So. see you then. and bye for now!
