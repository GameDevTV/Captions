00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.966
Te gustaria

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.933
aprender to code the fun way by making computer games?! My name is Ben Tristem, I'm the

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.933
co-author of Sam's Teach Yourself Unity Game Development in 24 Hours, the 2nd Edition,

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.900
and this course if the result of a Kickstarter that funded over

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.866
1,000%! We're going to be teaching you to make games in Unity 4.6

6
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:23.866
and then later in the course in the brand new Unity 5. And we're going to be teaching

7
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:27.866
that in C#. C# is not only the most widely

8
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.866
supported language for Unity, but also, it's a fantastic industry standard

9
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:35.833
language, that has incredibly transferable skill. Whether you decide afterwards to make

10
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.800
computer games or go into .net programming, you'll be very well served with C#.

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.766
So, how do we do this? We start you off by helping you

12
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:47.800
to do something called "Eating the Frog", that is doing the thing that we find most people try and

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.133
avoid in Unity, which is scripting. So we won't let you do that, the first thing you do is learn to script in a game called Number Wizard,

14
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.933
a simple guess the number game. Moving on from there, remember those text

15
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:02.366
adventures you played as a kid, where you go through the book and you can choose your path? Well, we're going to make a

16
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.366
simple text adventure called Text 101, and then, you're going to be able to share it with the world,

17
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:12.800
using our free service to our students called Game Bucket. Moving on from Text 101, we're going to go into something

18
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.033
called Block Breaker. Now, Block Breaker is an Archinoid bat and ball clone, where you're bouncing off the blocks up the screen.

19
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:23.000
There you're going to learn a lot more about 2D physics, about creating menu

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
systems, and music for your game, and again, you'll share it with the world. From there,

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with my co-instructor Brice, you'll go into understanding animations

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in Laser Defender, a simple but elegant Space Invaders

23
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
clone. From there, we'll go on to Glitch Garden! Now, this is a Plant's

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
vs. Zombies clone, where you're going to learn even more about animation and animation state

25
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
machines and also how to handle a much more complex game with a lot more things

26
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
going on. Multiple enemy types, multiple defenses, for example.

27
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So from there, we're going to go onto Bowl Master! Now this is where we upgrade you to Unity

28
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
5, if you haven't done so already. We teach you about 3D physics and

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
3D graphics, and we also teach you an amazingly useful skill for

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
professional development called Test Driven Development! And that is going

31
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to serve you very well in the marketplace or when you create your own games.

32
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So going on from there, we're going to go into Zombie Runner! This is a 3D

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
game, a first person game, with a open world, simple open

34
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
world and AI pathfinding, where the enemies work their way to

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
you and lots of other features that you're going to need to give you the groundwork for a first person

36
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
shooter! Then, we create a simple sandbox called Twin Stick 2.5D,

37
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
which shows you the elements you'll need to make a 3D world

38
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
but a game that has all its movement constrained to 2 dimensions,

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
so you can create the next killer version of Donkey Kong, for example. And

40
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
finally, a section that's being built right now is Ahoy Matey! It's a real-

41
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
time multiplayer game, where you'll learn over the network multiplayer

42
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
game mechanics. So, it's a fantastic time to learn to code and what better

43
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
way then to learn through making computer games, so please take this course now!

44
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.366
