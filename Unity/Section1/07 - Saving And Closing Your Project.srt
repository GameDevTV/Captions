
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, in this video we're going to talk

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
about saving and closing your projects! So, the project

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've got on the screen has, firstly, a

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
script here, that is unsaved. I know it's unsaved

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
two ways. There is a dot up here, near the top, rather than

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
a cross, and also at the very top of the

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
screen, where it says NumberWizard.cs, there's a star. So, the way to save this

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
script is Command S or Control S on the PC, or File

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and save. So, go ahead and save your script!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're nearing the end of the section. At the end of each section is a great time to save

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
everything. You might want to close Unity, close Mono, restart your

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
machine or whatever, so you need to know how to close things down gracefully.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, that's how you save your script and exit. By the way, if you try to exit

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Monodevelop and you have anything unsaved, of course, it will warn you.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, so now let's look at the

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Unity Editor, and take a look at a few things here.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Firstly, it's a good time, at the end of a section, to

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
tidy up. Generally you want to be tidying up

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
anything you've created that you don't want. Well, we don't actually want this NumberWizard

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
.cs script at the moment, because we've done nothing

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
with it. So, it's a good time to tidy that up. The way to delete a script

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is either right click and Delete or Edit and Delete

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
or you can go Command and

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Backspace on a PC. So, get rid of your NumberWizard.cs

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
script! Another thing to mention, at this stage, is

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you may, when you started your project, have chosen 3D

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
instead of 2D as the default. It really doesn't make a lot of

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
difference, to be honest. The main difference you're going to notice, if you did

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
choose 3D, is that this toggle here at the top of the

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
scene will not be pressed in and you will have a

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
3D environment like this, with a plain disappearing off into

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
the distance and this gizmo up here looking kind of

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
3D or you may be in 2D, like

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that. So, it doesn't really matter, you can leave it in 3D

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
for now, it's absolutely fine. We're not going to be using the

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
scene anyway, so that's just fine! So,

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the next thing I'd like to do is just to remind you how to

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
move windows around. So, this tab here, this Console Tab,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
let's move it back down to the Project, so it's back to

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Unity default for now. So, grab hold of Console, move it

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
back down next to Project, and leave yourself

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
on the Project Tab. That's fantastic! Now, I also want

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to show you briefly how to rename a scene. So again, when you're closing down and

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
tidying up a project at the end of a section, you may want to rename

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
scenes to make more sense. The way you do that is you right click,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or just click on the scene once and then

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
again say the name of the new scene. So,

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
let's call it Main, for practice. Game, Main, it doesn't matter!

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who knows what to call a scene, when there's only one scene? But rename your

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
scene to Main, just for practice, for me please. And then, you'll see, at the

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
top of the window, that it now says Main.Unity and Number Wizard,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
etc. So, that's done!

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, you could just exit Unity. That would

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
be fine, and it would ask you to save everything. I want to show you a couple of save

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
options. Under the File Menu, you can save the scene or

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Command S, and that will actually save this main

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
dot Unity scene, which basically is everything in the Hierarchy. So, that's

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
saved for you. You've also got a Save Project option.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't use that very often, that will save all your assets

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and anything else that's changed. You can use it if

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you want, but again, when you exit Unity, it will automatically save

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
your project for you. So now you are safe, basically, to

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
exit Unity. In summary, you could have exited Monodevelop

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and Unity without doing any of that, and it will ask you,

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
like most programs do, whether you want to save your changes. But I prefer

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to save by volition, by thinking about it,

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
rather than relying on that, because it's all too easy

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
when you exit a program to exit and choose the wrong thing and say no

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I didn't want to save or yes I did want to save, either way, causing yourself

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
a problem. So, it's a good habit to save specifically, when you want

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to, and then, when you quit, you won't have any errors. You'll just be

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
out. OK, the final thing to say now

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
is, that you can now safely move your project folder,

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the entire folder that you created. If you put it where you didn't want it.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well I've got it in this folder here, called

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Run Through and then Number Wizard. Because both Mono

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and Unity are closed, if they

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
are not closed. For instance, on a Mac, if your Mono has a little kind of

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
glow below it's not closed, and do just quit it go be sure.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But if you have quit mono and Unity completely, then you can be sure

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
everything is saved, and that is a good time to

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
move your Number Wizard Folder. For instance, I've got Number Wizard inside

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Number Wizard here. A bit of a mess! So, let's just fix that! I just

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
move the stuff in the Number Wizard Folder up a

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
level, to here, or

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
rather to here and then delete my Number

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Wizard Sub-Folder, and I've tidied things up. So, that's

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
absolutely safe to do, once you've closed Unity and

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mono. Now, if you want to reopen your project later, say you want to

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
shut your machine down now, that's absolutely fine! If you want to carry on the

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
course immediately, then the way to reopen your project, there's lot of ways...

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
One is to go into Unity and Open

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Recent, but of course, that won't work if you've moved the folder around.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, the sure fire way to reopen your project is to find the Assets

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sub-Folder and then double click on the .Unity File, any of

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the .Unity scene files, so this Main.unity.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And when you do that, then you wlll be back into Unity.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You can be in 2D or 3D, it doesn't matter! You've got a

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
camera, you've got a Main Scene, you've got an Inspector, and

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that's it! So, you want to end up looking like this, at the end of this section,

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
to make sure that you're ready for the next thing. So, there you go! You know how to leave

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Unity and come back in with confidence! See you soon!
