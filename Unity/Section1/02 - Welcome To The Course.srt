00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.600
Hey and welcome to the course! If you haven't
seen the promo video above. recently maybe

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.019
you signed up a few weeks ago. take a quick
look now. because it'll remind you of the

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.650
projects in the course. I'm really excited
to have you here. because I can see in the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.249
discussions all the amazing things that you
guys get up to and the progress that you make.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.119
So. I want to tell you a little bit about
the people that I see get the most from this

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.989
course. You guessed it. they're the people
who put the most into the course. so please

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:31.269
be active in the discussions. Please try all
of the challenges that we set you. and really

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.360
just try and do a little bit more than you're
asked all the time and you will literally

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.560
get out what you've put in; I really see that
pattern with other students on the course.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.640
I want to explain the Unity version we're
using. So. back in the summer of 2014. we

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.850
re-recorded the course to make sure that it
was using the new User Interface from Unity

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.680
4.6. so that was in the summer of 2014. By
the spring of 2015. Unity 5 was released.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.650
so we re-evaluated and decided that the changes
in Unity 5 were so small. because most of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.500
the changes were already incorporated into
Unity. in Unity 4.6. So. we didn't and we

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.820
haven't and we won't re-record the beginning
parts of the course. in Unity 5. because it's

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.930
simply not worth it. the differences are so
minor. Come the summer of 2015. we released

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.260
our first Unity 5 section. which is Bowl Master.
so from Bowl Master onwards you will be using

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.530
Unity 5. because at that point we first need
some features that are available in Unity

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.170
5. so we install Unity 5. And now. it's winter 2015 and the production of the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.060
main course if over. but I'm now remastering
the first section. We're committed to continuous

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.110
updating of this course. and this is just
a part of that. So. you're going to be starting

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.540
with Unity 4.6. and as I say. at Bowl Master
we'll upgrade to Unity 5. Don't worry. you

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.710
can have both versions installed at the same
time; that's not a problem. What do you expect?

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.229
Well. students are on 24/7. and so please
use the discussions. look at Brice's great

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.180
video a few down. and it tells you how to
pose good questions. Pose your question in

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.670
there. and there are students on all around
the world. There's typically a dozen. several

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.610
dozen actually student on at any one time.
and you're likely to get a response from somebody

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.819
else very quickly. I will be diving into the
discussion myself. regularly every two or

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.709
three days. something like that. and Brice
doesn't take an active part in the discussions

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.450
anymore. he was involved in the initial production
of the course and you'll see him at various

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.010
points. but you'll basically see me in the
discussions and the other students. So. that's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.599
all I've got to say in this intro. I want
to dive straight in. in the next video and

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.580
start downloading Unity. Attached to this
video. you will find the section notes. and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.150
that is a print-out that you can do without
the slide backgrounds. of all of the slides

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.800
for this section. and you can print that out
or just keep it on your computer and save

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.599
some trees. And the slide backgrounds are
taken off. so that you don't waste too much

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.010
ink. So. good luck! Let's dive in. in the
next video. which will be a screen cast diving

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.650
into Windows 8. and let's get Unity Installed.
