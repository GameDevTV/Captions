1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,766


2
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:06,032
So, let's dive in and get ourselves a copy
of Unity. Then, I will talk about how it fits

3
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:13,399
in your range of game development programs.
So, let's start with a Google search for get

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,100
Unity or download Unity may be better. And
then, there's a specific URL you're looking

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,466
for, which is the download archive, you can
see it at the bottom of my screen there, and

6
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:32,199
I'll click on it. www.unity3d.com/getunity/download/archive
Now, if for any reason you have trouble finding

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,500
that or the URL changes, just look for Unity
download archive on Google. And we want version

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,933
4.x, now just get the latest version of 4.x,
as long as you're on 4.6.3 or newer, then

9
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:49,033
you will be absolutely fine. And then, choose
your platform. in this case it's Windows,

10
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:53,499
most of you will be on Windows, a very similar
process on a Mac, and you click Unity Editor

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,000
there. So, just take a look at the screen,
you can see the URL, where you click, and

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,333
Unity Editor. That's to say, if what you see
on the screen is later than this, no problem,

13
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,766
just get the latest one, as long as it's 4.6.
something.  

14
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:09,766
Hi Sam here with a quick post video edit. I just wanted to say that

15
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:13,766
a lot of people ask whether you can use Unity 5.3

16
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:17,766
or whatever newer version of Unity. Now the general answer is

17
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:21,766
not really you should be using Unity 4.6. Just as

18
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:25,766
described; that we're downloading here in order to get exactly the same experience

19
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:29,766
as we are demonstrating in the videos in the coming sections. However,

20
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:33,766
if you feel very brave then you can go ahead

21
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:37,766
and get a newer version but you will have to check in the Q&A for differences

22
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,199
as things aren't exactly the same.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,733
OK, cool! So, you click that and

24
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:45,433
the download starts of course. Now, this is
going to take ages; it's going to take like

25
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:49,933
an hour to download. So, while that's downloading
I just want to talk you through a few other

26
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:56,699
things. Firstly, I want to explain that Unity
is not to be used in isolation. What you're

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,166
downloading is the Unity Editor, but you will
also be downloading a integrated development

28
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:10,332
environment, an IDE. Now, in the case of Unity
4.6 that's something called MonoDevelop, which

29
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:19,633
is a IDE that is bundled with Unity 4.6. Here
it is! OK. And on the Mac, you will also be

30
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:24,233
using MonoDevlop in Unity 5 at the moment,
but on the PC, when we go to Unity 5 we'll

31
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:29,633
be using something you may have heard of called
Visual Studio. Now, for the level of coding

32
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:33,166
that we're doing, at least in the early part
of the course, it makes very little difference

33
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:39,566
whether you're on MonoDevelop or Visual Studio.
But for Unity 4.6, we will be using MonoDevelop.

34
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:42,799
And MonoDevelop is where you're going to be
writing your code. So, we've already got two

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,200
programs. We've got Unity, for manipulating
all our game objects and everything, and it's

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,633
where we'll spend most of our time, but we'll
spend a fair amount of our time in this IDE,

37
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:56,366
Integrated Development Environment, which
is as I say MonoDevelop or Visual Studio.

38
00:02:56,366 --> 00:03:01,299
There are also other things that you're going
to need longer term. We have a course on Blender,

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,700
and Blender is a 3D asset creation tool. This
is a free tool that lets you make even full

40
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,833
movie quality 3D effects, so if you want to
do anything more complex than a simple cube

41
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:15,399
or sphere, you're going to need something
like Blender. There's also programs like GIMP.org,

42
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,733
which is a free PhotoShop clone. I'm mentioning
only free programs, because I want to make

43
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:24,899
this as accessible to everybody as possible.
And also for sound, you're going to need something

44
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,366
like Audacity for editing and changing sound.
So, Unity doesn't sit on it's own, it sits

45
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:37,399
in an eco-system of programs, and what you're
downloading is going to be two things, Unity's

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,900
Editor and a Integrated Development Environment.
In this case with Unity 4.6 it's going to

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,000
be MonoDevelop. So, let's let that download
in the background. And in the next question,

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,733
lecture rather, I'm going to be helping you
to know how to ask good questions, and it's

49
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:55,433
going to be my co-instructor Brice talking
you through that. So, grab yourself a cup

50
00:03:55,433 --> 00:04:00,166
of tea, take some notes, and get ready for
Brice to give you a really good heads up on

51
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,066
how to ask good questions in the course.
