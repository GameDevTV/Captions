00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,060
So, let's dive in and get ourselves a copy
of Unity. Then, I will talk about how it fits

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:13,420
in your range of game development programs.
So, let's start with a Google search for get

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,110
Unity or download Unity may be better. And
then, there's a specific URL you're looking

00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,480
for, which is the download archive, you can
see it at the bottom of my screen there, and

00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:32,230
I'll click on it. www.unity3d.com/getunity/download/archive
Now, if for any reason you have trouble finding

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:38,530
that or the URL changes, just look for Unity
download archive on Google. And we want version

00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,940
4.x, now just get the latest version of 4.x,
as long as you're on 4.6.3 or newer, then

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,050
you will be absolutely fine. And then, choose
your platform. in this case it's Windows,

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,510
most of you will be on Windows, a very similar
process on a Mac, and you click Unity Editor

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,020
there. So, just take a look at the screen,
you can see the URL, where you click, and

00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,340
Unity Editor. That's to say, if what you see
on the screen is later than this, no problem,

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,319
just get the latest one, as long as it's 4.6.
something. OK, cool! So, you click that and

00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,999
the download starts of course. Now, this is
going to take ages; it's going to take like

00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:15,530
an hour to download. So, while that's downloading
I just want to talk you through a few other

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,279
things. Firstly, I want to explain that Unity
is not to be used in isolation. What you're

00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:27,749
downloading is the Unity Editor, but you will
also be downloading a integrated development

00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:35,909
environment, an IDE. Now, in the case of Unity
4.6 that's something called MonoDevelop, which

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:45,219
is a IDE that is bundled with Unity 4.6. Here
it is! OK. And on the Mac, you will also be

00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:49,799
using MonoDevlop in Unity 5 at the moment,
but on the PC, when we go to Unity 5 we'll

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,219
be using something you may have heard of called
Visual Studio. Now, for the level of coding

00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:58,739
that we're doing, at least in the early part
of the course, it makes very little difference

00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:05,149
whether you're on MonoDevelop or Visual Studio.
But for Unity 4.6, we will be using MonoDevelop.

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,390
And MonoDevelop is where you're going to be
writing your code. So, we've already got two

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,780
programs. We've got Unity, for manipulating
all our game objects and everything, and it's

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,220
where we'll spend most of our time, but we'll
spend a fair amount of our time in this IDE,

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,960
Integrated Development Environment, which
is as I say MonoDevelop or Visual Studio.

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,870
There are also other things that you're going
to need longer term. We have a course on Blender,

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,280
and Blender is a 3D asset creation tool. This
is a free tool that lets you make even full

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,430
movie quality 3D effects, so if you want to
do anything more complex than a simple cube

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,980
or sphere, you're going to need something
like Blender. There's also programs like GIMP.org,

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,320
which is a free PhotoShop clone. I'm mentioning
only free programs, because I want to make

00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,470
this as accessible to everybody as possible.
And also for sound, you're going to need something

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,960
like Audacity for editing and changing sound.
So, Unity doesn't sit on it's own, it sits

00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,990
in an eco-system of programs, and what you're
downloading is going to be two things, Unity's

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,480
Editor and a Integrated Development Environment.
In this case with Unity 4.6 it's going to

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,580
be MonoDevelop. So, let's let that download
in the background. And in the next question,

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,320
lecture rather, I'm going to be helping you
to know how to ask good questions, and it's

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,020
going to be my co-instructor Brice talking
you through that. So, grab yourself a cup

00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,740
of tea, take some notes, and get ready for
Brice to give you a really good heads up on

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,650
how to ask good questions in the course.
