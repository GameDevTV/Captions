00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,480
OK, my Unity Download has finished.&nbsp;I hope
yours has, too, otherwise you'll just need

00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,519
to wait a little bit, until it's finished
downloading. So, let's go ahead and look at

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,820
the installation process. Pretty standard,
double-clicking on it. Of course, on a Mac

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,800
the installation process is very similar.
You double-click and get a disk image, and

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,560
then, you'll do the normal things that you
would do on a Mac installation as well. In

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,779
fact, a lot of the rest of this course is
recorded on a Mac, so I am very familiar with

00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:31,359
Macs, but for the installation, because the
majority of people are using PC's, I'm going

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,980
to be showing it on a PC. Alright, so let's
take a look. Has this window popped up? Here

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,530
we go! Welcome to the Unity setup, so we just
go through, we agree now. Slow down! Don't

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,190
just click everything. We want to check all
of these boxes, that's fine. We want the example

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,350
project and then, MonoDevelop IDE we've talked
about, and the web-player plugin, that you'll

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,300
find out about later, but look, when you get
the the destination folder instead of Unity

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,870
I want you to call it Unity 4.6. Alright,
this means that later on you'll be able to

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,330
install Unity 5, without it going over the
top of this, and Unity will know where it's

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,780
version of 4.6 is. So, put it in a folder
called Unity 4.6, and then, it'll go ahead

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,170
and install. Now, this may take a long time,
it may not take very long, it depends entirely

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,750
on your computer. I suspect it's going to
take several minutes, because this is an SSD

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,560
based machine, relatively very fast and it's
still taking a while. So, one thing you'll

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,140
also need to know about with Unity, is whether
you're allowed to use it for free. Now, it'll

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,030
explain this actually, after it's installed,
but the bottom line is, until you make $100,000

00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,180
you're fine. And the other thing to be slightly
aware of is if you are being naughty and installing

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,770
Unity 5, which by the way won't cause you
too much trouble you'll just have some changes

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,860
in the code, when you get to block breaker.
But if you are installing Unity 5 then, it

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,640
comes with a free version of Visual Studio
Community, so you need to be careful about

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
the license rules on Visual Studio Community,
but in general if you're using Unity 4.6 here,

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,440
with MonoDevelop and you are just an individual
and you don't have $100,000 of revenue from

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,290
Unity Games yet, and if you did why are you
taking this course? [Laughs] But actually

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,640
in fairness, some people have been very successful
already and still got stuff from this course.

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,969
But look, don't worry, just install it, start
making games. You don't have to report your

00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:15,069
revenue to anybody or anything at the moment,
alright. And then, as you start to actually

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,139
publish games and receive income from the
games, then start looking at the license terms

00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,370
on Unity's website, and you may also want
to look at the license terms on Visual Studio's

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,709
website, if you're using Visual Studio for
any reason, but for now, you are golden. Now,

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,090
let's just look at where this is going, where
it's installing. It's going into C, and then,

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,829
Program Files. Oop, probably Program Files
x86 and then, Unity 4.6. Now, you may have

00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:46,019
another folder here, called Unity, which could
be your Unity 5 version, but this is 4.6,

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,849
and it's installing two things, the Editor
and MonoDevelop, which we talked about. So,

00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,419
the Editor is going to be where you'll spend
a lot of your time, and MonoDevelop will be

00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:58,840
your Integrated Development Environment or
IDE for short. So, we just wait for this installation

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,510
to finish. Now, I've got a challenge for you,
so one of the things that happens during this

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,719
course is, we regularly stop you in your flow
and say, look let's challenge you to do something.

00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:13,439
So, your challenge is to get Unity 4.6. something
running. It's your very first mini challenge.

00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,329
If you have problems, try checking you have
at least 10 Gig of free space, reboot your

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,659
machine, and install again, but get Unity
5 installed yourself, that's the challenge.

00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:25,829
So, with these challenges, we like you to
pause the video, hence the pause sign down

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,260
at the bottom right. Go and get the thing
done, try your very best, and then, un-pause

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,689
the video and come back, and I'll show you
how I did it. So, go ahead and get your Unity

00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:46,290
4.6.x running now. OK, welcome back! So, I
am just going to continue my installation.

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:53,540
So, it should be a pretty simple question
now, if you've had other versions of Unity

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,519
installed, it may ask you like you saw that
prompt there for me. that a folder already

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,419
exists do you want to overwrite it? Well,
that's fine. The key, the proof of the pudding

00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,980
here will be that we can just open Unity 4.6.
OK, let's run it and make sure it runs, and

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,099
then, if it does, we have achieved all we
need for this section. We get a splash screen,

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:18,650
which is good! And we have Unity 4.6 running
here on our machine, which is fantastic! So,

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,580
that's it! You can get to all of the menus,
etc. So, I could do with just pinning this

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,580
to the Task-Bar, so I can get back to it later,
and then, I'm just going to exit Unity now.

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,460
And we're good to go! Fantastic! See you soon!
