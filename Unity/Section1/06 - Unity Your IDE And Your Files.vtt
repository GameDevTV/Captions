00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:06.190
Hey welcome back! Let's explore how Unity,
your File System, and your Integrated Development

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.940
Environment interrelate, so if we open up
Unity again, then it may open up into a recent

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.019
project, the project you first created, it
may not, it depends on whether you created

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.640
a project before. So, in my case, my project
was created in Documents, New Unity Project.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.410
Now, that's going to be pretty common place
for this first project you created in the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.010
previous video, to be created. So, Documents,
New Unity Project. You can just say Select

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.840
Folder and it will open, OK that's great.
So, that's one way of doing it. Another way,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.309
another thing that I should tell you is that
you can move. If we go to the Documents Folder,

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.739
we can move this New Unity Project. Once Unity
is closed, we can move it elsewhere, so maybe

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.890
the Desktop, or better, I'm actually going
to get organized and I suggest you do as well.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.809
I'm going to, under My Documents, put a folder
called Repos, for reasons, which will come

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.410
clear much much later in the course, but within
that, I'm going to then make myself a folder

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.610
called Unity Course or just Unity. And then,
in there I'm going to put the New Unity Project.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.500
OK, so now it's there. Now, again if you open
Unity it's going to say where is it? And we're

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.330
going to point it to it, so I'm just going
to go and find Documents, Repos, Unity, the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.689
project folder, select the folder and we're
good to go. OK! So, that's how the project

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.500
folder works. Let me show you how scripts
are saved. Now, right click down in Assets.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.229
Now, if for any reason you're interface doesn't
look like this, at the top right you can go

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.229
to Layout and then Default. You see that,
Layout and Default. You click that and it'll

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.250
come back to this Default Layout. So, right
click and go to create C# script. I'm going

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.650
to leave it with this Default name and just
hit Return. OK, this is a script called New

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.689
Behavior. Now, where is it? Let's have a look
back at our File System. In this new Unity

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.399
project folder, under Assets, we have a New
Behavior Script.cs. OK, and that's being created

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.149
for us, so that's where it is. Now, when in
Unity we double click, it's going to open

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.070
MonoDevelop. You don't edit scripts in Unity,
you edit them in MonoDevelop and here it is.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.810
And if I make some changes to that script,
you can do what you like in here, just write

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.179
Hello at the bottom or something. That's not
valid code, but we're not dealing with coding

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.530
yet. I want to show you that this little dot
here changes from a cross to a dot, to say

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.209
that this script isn't saved, so right now,
before I save on my disk... Let me just get

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:29.870
back to my disk. This file has not changed
OK, we have to save it to the disk with File

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.959
and Save or Save All, and then, back in Unity
you can see my word Hello has come up in the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.810
preview here and this file has changed. So,
we create scripts in Unity, so that it knows

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.550
where they are, and if we need to delete them,
which I'm going to go ahead and do, delete

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.750
that script because it's absolutely rubbish.
You delete them in Unity, but as you'll see

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.190
in the section notes, which you can download
from the welcome video, if you want to rename

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.430
scripts you do that inside the script, and
if you want to edit inside MonoDevelop rather,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.730
and if you want to edit scripts, you also
do that in MonoDevelop. So, the bottom line

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.860
here is we create scripts in Unity, we delete
scripts in Unity, and then, we edit and rename

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.959
scripts over in our development environment.
OK, that's the bottom line for you. So, that's

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.879
how those three things relate. Now, do go
and get your Unity project folders organized,

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.650
close Unity, go find where it's stored. In
my case Repos, oops wrong one, Unaflight is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.180
a good game though. Unity and then there's
your project and you can even rename it. This

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.519
is you know, I don't know, First Test Project.
That will all work just fine, it's just that

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.379
when you open Unity next, it'll go where has
it gone? You just point it at it and the project

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.220
reopens. Fantastic! So, hopefully you now
know how to open and close Unity projects

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.560
and where the script files will be saved and
that you should be creating and deleting scripts

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.069
in here, where we'll be editing and renaming
them in the IDE. So, that's it! Now, in the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.379
next video, Brice is going to be talking you
through the Unity Editor, for the first time.

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.670
So, settle down, enjoy Brice talking you through
that, and I will see you soon!
