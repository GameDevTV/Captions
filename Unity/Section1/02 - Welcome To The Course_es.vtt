00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.650
los proyectos en el curso. Estoy muy motivado
por tenerte aquí, porqué puedo ver en las

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.249
discusiones en el foro todas las cosas increible que empezais 
y cómo progresais

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.119
Voy a hablarte de la gente que veo aprovecha mas el curso


00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.989
es la gente que invierte lo maximo, por favor

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:31.269
estate activo en las discusiones. Por favor intenta
todos los retos 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.360
y haz un poco mas de lo que se te pida y 
literalmente

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.560
tu trabajo sera gratificado. Siempre veo éste patron 
con otros estudiantes del curso.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.640
I want to explain the Unity version we're
using. So, back in the summer of 2014, we
Quiero explicar la version de Unity que estamos
usando. El pasado verano del 2014,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.850
re-recorded the course to make sure that it
was using the new User Interface from Unity
regrabamos el curso para usar el nuevo interfaz 
de Unity 4.6

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.680
4.6, so that was in the summer of 2014. By
the spring of 2015, Unity 5 was released,
,esto fué en el verando del 2014. Hacia la
primavera del 2015, salio Unity 5.


00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.650
so we re-evaluated and decided that the changes
in Unity 5 were so small, because most of
lo pensamos y decidimos que los cambio es Unity 5 eran 
insignificantes, porque la mayoría

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.500
the changes were already incorporated into
Unity, in Unity 4.6. So, we didn't and we
de los cambios estaban ya incorporados en Unity

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.820
haven't and we won't re-record the beginning
parts of the course, in Unity 5, because it's

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.930
simply not worth it, the differences are so
minor. Come the summer of 2015, we released

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.260
our first Unity 5 section, which is Bowl Master,
so from Bowl Master onwards you will be using

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.530
Unity 5, because at that point we first need
some features that are available in Unity

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.170
5, so we install Unity 5. And now, it's winter 2015 and the production of the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.060
main course if over, but I'm now remastering
the first section. We're committed to continuous

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.110
updating of this course, and this is just
a part of that. So, you're going to be starting

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.540
with Unity 4.6, and as I say, at Bowl Master
we'll upgrade to Unity 5. Don't worry, you

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.710
can have both versions installed at the same
time; that's not a problem. What do you expect?

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.229
Well, students are on 24/7, and so please
use the discussions, look at Brice's great

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.180
video a few down, and it tells you how to
pose good questions. Pose your question in

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.670
there, and there are students on all around
the world. There's typically a dozen, several

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.610
dozen actually student on at any one time,
and you're likely to get a response from somebody

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.819
else very quickly. I will be diving into the
discussion myself, regularly every two or

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.709
three days, something like that, and Brice
doesn't take an active part in the discussions

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.450
anymore, he was involved in the initial production
of the course and you'll see him at various

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.010
points, but you'll basically see me in the
discussions and the other students. So, that's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.599
all I've got to say in this intro. I want
to dive straight in, in the next video and

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.580
start downloading Unity. Attached to this
video, you will find the section notes, and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.150
that is a print-out that you can do without
the slide backgrounds, of all of the slides

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.800
for this section, and you can print that out
or just keep it on your computer and save

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.599
some trees. And the slide backgrounds are
taken off, so that you don't waste too much

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.010
ink. So, good luck! Let's dive in, in the
next video, which will be a screen cast diving

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.650
into Windows 8, and let's get Unity Installed.
