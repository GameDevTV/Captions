2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.700
Hey welcome back! In this video we're going to take a look at MonoDevelop for the first time!

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.700
So, if you've closed Unity in your enthusiasm, no problem, just re-open

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.700
it! Let's go into our project we created, Number Wizard, which you should be able to

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.700
find. If you're having trouble, maybe File and Open Project will

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.700
help you. OK, and remember we saved that scene

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.700
Game. If you didn't, then File, Save Scene, and let's just have that Game scene,

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.700
just so we're ready for later on. Anyway, we're talking about MonoDevelop, so what you need to do

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.700
is create your script. Remember, in the diagram we drew before we showed you that we will always create our

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.700
scripts from inside Unity. So, let's do it this way, this time! Right-click in

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.700
Assets. So, Project tab at the bottom. Then, Assets, right-click

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.700
and create C# Script for me. Call it

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.700
Number Wizard. All one word, capital N, capital W, no spaces.

14
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.700
OK, NumberWizard.cs. So now,

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.700
Unity has written a file called NumberWizard.cs to the file system.

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.700
In fact, let me show you that, Reveal in Finder. Here we go! Wherever you saved it, your NumberWizard

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.700
project has got a load of stuff you don't have to worry about, but it has an Assets folder, and within

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.700
the Assets folder, which is what you see over in Unity, you have a Game.unity which is

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
your scene or level and then we have a NumberWizard.cs. O.K.

20
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.700
So, it's created the file, just like we talked about. Double-click on it and for the first time...

21
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.700
[Sings] For the first time in... OK,

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.700
here it comes! And there it is, you have your NumberWizard.cs

23
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.700
script open in  Monowizard, so, in NumberWizard

24
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700
OK cool! So, I wanted to show you around MonoDevelop a little

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.700
bit. It should look like this, if it doesn't then it's your View Settings. You want to be in the Solution

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.700
View. On the left-hand side, I also have a pad open called the

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.700
Solution Pad. You don't necessarily need that. Mmm So, here's a few things

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.700
that are going to make our lives easier. Before we do anything, let's go to MonoDevelop

29
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.700
Preferences, and I want to go and help you scroll down and

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.700
find the bit that talks about Auto-Indentation in MonoBehavior,

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.700
which is under Text Editor, Behavior, and then,

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Indentation Mode. And I want to set that to

33
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700
Automatic, rather than smart. Alright, this is a minor thing,

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.700
but it's going to make your life a little bit easier, when you start typing code, with regards to how it

35
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.700
indents, which means how much white space it puts in. OK,

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.700
so that's the Auto-Indent mode! That's fantastic! Now, the other thing to get your eye in for with

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.700
MonoDevelop is pretty obvious, but these things are line numbers, 1 to 16. We will

38
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.700
be using those a lot later, particularly when we see an error we're going to dive into the script and

39
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.700
look at the line numbers. So, they'll just continue to add in every time you add a new code line.

40
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.700
Mmm another thing we're going to be doing is moving the indentation

41
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.700
of code around, so this is correctly indented,

42
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.700
at the moment. But there are a couple of ways you can do that, you can go to the line in question...

43
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.700
by the way, you can do all of the coding without the mouse. In fact, I'm going to be doing that to

44
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.700
try and keep the mouse out of the way for you. So, the Cursor Keys will go up and down and left and right,

45
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.700
as usual. If you want to indent or outdent a line, hold down Command

46
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.700
or Control, depending on whether you're using a Mac or PC, and use the left and right square brackets,

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.700
and each time you do that, it'll bring that line in. A shift, Holding down Shift will allow you to

48
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.700
select a block, and then, again with the Command or Control and the brackets will

49
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.700
indent and outdent your code. Another way to do that is to go to the start of the line and push the Tab

50
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.700
Key, or you could do Shift Tab to go back, but you have to be at the start of the line then.

51
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.700
By the way, please do not use spaces, use Tabs. Do not go 1, 2, 3, 4, you may

52
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.333
notice it's 4 spaces. We don't want you using spaces, use Tabs.

53
00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:31.333
OK, so final keyboard shortcut you may want to know about is holding down the  ALT Key

54
00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:35.333
and going left and right, and then, you can go one word at a time, that could be handy.

55
00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:39.333
There's actually tons and tons of keyboard shortcuts in MonoDevelop,

56
00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:43.300
so why don't I just show you where to go and look for them and you can

57
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.300
decide what to use. Each one takes a little bit of time to develop the habit. So MonoDevelop,

58
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.333
Menu, and then Preferences on the Mac. On a PC it's Tools and Options,

59
00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:55.366
and then, you will find Key Bindings, and that will show you all

60
00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:59.333
the existing Key Bindings and new ones you can create yourself, if you want.

61
00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:03.366
So basically, the take away from this video is, using keybaord

62
00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:07.366
shortcuts in MonoDevelop is going to save you a load of time, so start building

63
00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:11.366
the habit of using them one at a time, and then, you will be

64
00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:15.066
in [Laughs] code nirvana. See you later!
