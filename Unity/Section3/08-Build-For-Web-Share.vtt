00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.030
Hey, welcome back guys and girls! So, it's
time to take the bold step of sharing our

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.100
creation with the world. This is a huge leap,
the important step in your journey as a game

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.119
developer, because it's not until you share
it, with the wider world, that you start getting

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.169
proper feedback. So, in this video, we're
going to encourage you to create your own

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.800
story, show you how to build for the web.
We're going to test our build locally. Then,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.780
we're going to share our game using our service
GameBucket.io or something similar, and then,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.940
post to the course discussions for feedback
from our students and also to Facebook for

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:49.160
feedback from the wider world. So firstly,
what can you do to create and extend this

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.589
story, if you haven't already? So, we have
my default story here, all embedded in this

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.969
text controller script, but I would like you
to, if you haven't done it already, make your

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.000
own story, at least change something. Here
are some ideas about what you could change.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.909
You could just simply tweak our text to make
it read better. You could make a whole new

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.990
game, with the same structure as ours, just
slot in a different story. Even better, you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.490
could make a whole new game with different
structures, different decisions, a different

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.530
State Diagram. Why not translate the game
to your native language and share that. There's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.610
bound to be other people, in the student community,
and especially on Facebook that speak your

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.600
language and would love to play a game in
their native language. And try adding images

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.939
if you want, but don't spend too long on this,
because we're going to cover it later. So,

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.880
we want to be able to share your game, if
it's great as well, on the Facebook group

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.729
and on our WebPage, so we want to standardize
the build. And also, this is a good idea in

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.020
terms of you targeting a specific resolution,
and so I suggest 800 by 600, with a black

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.180
background. If your text doesn't fit, then
reduce your font size. Alright, let's go into

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.200
Unity and have a look. You can preview this
resolution by going to your Game Window, and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.980
then, where it probably says Free Aspect,
at the top left here, click on 800 by 600,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.660
and if you haven't already defined that, you
can add that resolution, but we have shown

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.810
you how to do that. And then, you'll see a
white warning all the time your window is

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.810
not the full resolution, so if you detach
your Game Window and make it larger, you can

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.010
now see that the white warning goes away at
the top left. And when we play our game, you

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.540
can check that your text fits. This is a good
place to check that it actually fits. If it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.290
doesn't fit, for some reason, then come out
of play mode, obviously, go back into your

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.040
Scene View, look at your Text Elements, and
then resize, within the text, change the Font

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.599
Size until it does fit, is what I suggest.
So, make sure that in this Unity preview it

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.459
works, and then, we're going to go ahead and
change our Build Settings. So, you go down

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.769
to File, Build Settings, and you'll get a
window pop-up. And the first thing we need

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.849
to do is put the Game Scene into the scenes
in build, in Build Settings. We're going to

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.700
choose Web Player, and then, Player Settings,
down at the bottom here. And I'm going to

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.370
choose a screen width of 800 and a screen
height of 600 and a black background like

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.879
that. 800 by 600 with a black background.
So, once you have your Build Settings how

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.879
you want them, for your Unity game, this is
how you upload to GameBucket.io and share

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.870
it with the world. Click Build and Run. You'll
be presented with a dialog, so choose a folder.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.540
I'm going to use my Downloads. And give your
folder a name that makes sense to you. I would

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.360
suggest you include the words Web Build in
it. So, I'm going to call this the Text101

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.379
Web Build v 01, anything like that, but make
sure it's very distinct from the project folder,

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:01.260
because we want you to be uploading a .zip
of a Web Build, not your Unity Project Folder.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.069
So, you may, like me, find that this immediately
opens itself in your default browser. My default

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.920
browser is Chrome, so don't bother trying
to install the Unity Web Player in Chrome,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.269
it won't work there. Let's take a look, before
we upload our .zip, at what's on our disk.

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.360
We have a Text101 Web Build Folder, and inside
it we have two files. We have an .html file

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.820
and a .unity3d File. That's the right type
of folder for you to be zipping and sending

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.550
to Game Bucket. So, you go up a level, on
a Mac you right click your folder and compress,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.950
on a .zip you make your.zip file your normal
way, in a very similar way, and you end up

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.420
with a .zip file of a folder, that contains
an .html and a .unity3d. That's what we want

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.940
to upload to Game Bucket, a .zip like that.
Right! So, go to GameBucket.io, and you click

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.230
the Upload Button over here. Choose the .zip
file of the folder, it contains the .html.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.790
It will send it to the web and immediately
show it for you, like this. Now, provided

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.060
you're in one of the compatible browsers,
you'll be good to go. Just copy that URL,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.300
at the top here, and share that with whoever
you want to be able to play your game. Now,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.080
keep track of that URL, because this is the
only place you're going to get it. You're

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.440
just going to get it once here, and it's going
to stay hosted at this location for 30 days,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.640
for you for free. So, it's a super simple
way to share your game. So, once you've got

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.850
that, I just want you to share it in the course
discussions. So, how do you do that? Well,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.990
you find the lecture in question, which is
this one here, you click at the top right...

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.500
By the way, if this drawer on the right hand
side isn't out, you pull the drawer out with

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.730
this little arrow. You need to do this on
a Desktop. You can see other people have been

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.130
sharing their games here, so just do the same.
Just say something like, you know, escape

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.650
my prison or try my game, and then, just put
some preamble and paste your link. If you

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.070
want the link to be clickable, highlight it,
click here on the little chain, and Insert

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.970
Link. And make sure that the URL you put in
is the same as the text, or at lest make sure

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:05.320
the URL is right. You can just change the
text to something like Click This, and then,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.370
Click This will go off to the right place.
Now, just check it again. Copy the link address,

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.050
make sure it's alright. I would suggest you
copy the link address and paste it into an

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.850
incognito browser, before you click post.
You may get a warning, when you click post,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.860
about external links. That's OK, you're just
sharing the game you've made in the course,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.470
so you just click proceed, and then, your
game will be on there and just like others

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.270
people will start liking it and replying and
giving you feedback. So, that's the first

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:39.270
stage of sharing your game. As we've said,
we copy the URL from GameBuck.io, we check

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.180
it in an [Oops] anonymous or private browser,
we post as a discussion against the lecture,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.550
and finally, we share on Facebook.com/unitycourse,
our Facebook page. Let's take a look. Here

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.090
we are and you won't be able to post in the
main thread here, that's for us, but when

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.730
you post it will come up in the left hand
side, like these other people here have been

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.680
kindly sharing their games. Now, if we find
some that we really like, what we'll do is

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.230
we'll check with you first, and then, we'll
re-host and feature your post over here, in

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.000
the main thread. So, please do that, get the
feedback. The feedback you'll get here is

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.320
from the wider world. This is a brand new
page, so only 115 likes, but when you get to it,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.820
it may well be many many more. So, spread
this page with your friends, because this

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.250
is a great place to get feedback from people
outside of our student community, where the

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.800
feedback may be more honest. A little bit
more tough, more honest, which is exactly

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.720
what you want. Take one stage at a time, if
you like. Share it in the community first

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.380
and then on the Facebook page. So, congratulations
getting this far! We've done everything we

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.160
need to do in this video, which is encourage
you to create your own story. Please please

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.110
do that! You know how to build for the web,
you've tested it locally, you've shared it

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:53.090
using GameBucket.io or similar. You could
use a DropBox, if you've got a paid account,

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:59.210
or you could just get some free or paid for
web hosting and upload your files by .ftp.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.250
if you want to, it's not as good an experience,
but you could just zip your folder and stick

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.580
that in DropBox and then post a link to that
but I suggest GameBucket.io, it's by far the

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:13.870
easiest way of doing it. And then, post to
the course discussions and Facebook. So, cool!

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.060
Congratulations and see you soon!
