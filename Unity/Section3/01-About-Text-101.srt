00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, hi and welcome to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Text101. In Text101 we're going to be digging into

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a lot of the scripting stuff we went through in the previous

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
section and to take it a little bit further. So, what

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is that we are building in Text101, Ben? Well, it's a good old fashioned

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
text adventure game, so it's just going to have the tiniest

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
bit of graphic at the top but after that, it's entirely text,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and you're just going to be doing the old school, reading something

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then hitting a key to decide what to do next.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And it could be one thing you could do next or it could be three or four things

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you can do next, and by the end of it, you'll have written over 200 lines of

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
code. They're very similar lines of code, but it's still 200

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
lines of code, so you're going to have a great hand,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
at the end, and realize you're a proper programmer, already. So, it's like a

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
choose you're own adventure game, basically. Yeah, exactly! Just like you choose

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you're own fiction book. And it's really interesting, because what we're

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
actually going to be doing is some fundamental computer stunts,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and they way we're going to be doing it is building a state machine, in the background.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and you won't notice it, until the end, that you've got something that's actually quite

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
generic. Yeah, and the state machine is a really cool way

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
of doing it, on one hand, because you can

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
be very specific about every path you've taken

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to get to a current state, and you can make very rich

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
output and a very rich response to what the guy

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is doing. So, it's basically a tool for your tool box, that you can use

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in the future as well. We're just kind of building your tool box slowly. You've

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
had scripting, now we're adding some Finite State

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Machines, and we'll be adding into your tool box, throughout the course.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So yeah, and really the point of this particular section is they

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
can build and share. People can build and share their own game, right, and you can

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
build your own game and then share it. So, I really want you to

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
kind of, once you've finished this section, make your own adventure.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Create your own adventure, extend it, make cool

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
stuff with it, and share it with your friends. Share it with the other

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
people on the course. Share it on the website,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
share it with the world, basically. Yeah, well maybe even get a friend of yours to write this

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
story, and they can write the text and just tell you what keys they

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
want to be able to allow the player to press, and

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
write their own text, whatever. Please create a game,

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
build it for the web, and share it both on

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the Udemy discussions and on

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
www.completeunitydeveloper.com/community or wherever

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you want to put it on www.completeunitydeveloper.com. We're not fussy, just share it

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
with the world! So, go ahead, follow our game,

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
write your own story, share it with the world, and we'll see you on the other side!

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Awesome!
