00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So. welcome to the end of Text101!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Did you write your own story. or did you just copy out ours?

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you copied out ours. great! You've learned a lot. but please

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
go ahead and write your own stuff. because the whole point of making games is being creative

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
right. Be brave. do it. be fun! So. maybe

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you could ask a friend to write it. build it for the web. and share it

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
on Udemy's discussion groups and/or on

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
www.completeunitydeveloper.com right. That sounds about right. Yeah!

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yeah absolutely right! A game isn't a game unless people play it.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and it's not going to be played unless you share it with other people. So.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you have to take the courageous step of actually

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
putting your product. what you've created. out there.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And it's painful and it's hard and it's tough and you have to do it.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because that's the only way you're going to grow. So. share your game.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
just make sure you do that throughout the course. and make sure you share your games.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Cool. not much more to say. I hope you enjoyed Text101.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We'll be revisiting the story. at another point. as a surprise for you.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but for now. see you soon! Bye!
