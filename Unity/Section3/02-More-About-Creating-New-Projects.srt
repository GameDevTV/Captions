00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,570
So, let's get started with Text 101, you're
own text adventure game, and more importantly

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,670
text adventure engine! In this game we're
going to, even in this video, we're going

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,800
to recap how to create and save projects,
just to get you really confident with that,

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,970
setup and save your Text 101 project, talk
a little bit about what gets carried over

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,820
to new projects, when you start a new Unity
project, and we'll import your Prison Image

00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,620
Asset but not use it yet and then save your
project. OK, so let's dive into Unity for

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,910
a moment. If you open Unity, you'll probably
find that it's exactly where you left it,

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,670
and if you're following the course through
in order, then you'll have left it at the

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,340
end of Number Wizard Console, like this. So,
you're obviously going to need to start a

00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,590
new project, so let's be very clear about
where that project is going to get stored

00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:00,800
on your hard drive. Firstly, I want my project
to be in a directory over here, in Ben, and

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,920
then, under Repos for Repositories, because
of the way that I manage my code. And then,

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,659
I want it right in here, I want a folder right
in Ben Repos, this is a Mac by the way, and

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,820
I want that to be caled Text101. And so how
do I do that in Unity? Well, let's take a

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,610
look. Here we are in Number Wizard Console.
Let's go ahead and create a new project from

00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:28,979
the File Menu. When you do that, you'll have
several options, as you've seen before. Let's

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,520
start at the top set, that's going to set
the project directory. So, I go to this Repos

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,180
Folder, and I'm going to call it Text101.
Now, if I'm selected on the Repos Folder and

00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:46,409
I call it Text101, let's save and see what
happens, in a moment. Firstly, we need to

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,380
decide not to import any assets and set up
a 2D project. It's not super important whether

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,600
it's 2D or 3D, because things can easily be
changed in Unity, but so that things are consistent

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,829
with my videos, please choose 2D. OK fantastic!
Click on Create Project. Now, let's just firstly

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,739
check that folder. There you go, actually
you could see the folder while Unity temporarily

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:14,349
closed. It has created a Text101 folder, as
I wanted and within that it's got all the

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:20,239
stuff that Unity sets up by default, so that
is fantastic! We've achieved our first goal,

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,280
which is to recap how to create and save project
and to save our Text101. So, what gets carried

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,660
over to new projects? Well, one of the things
that's kind of lingering from the Number Wizard

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,800
project is that your Console Tab or your Layout
in general or as a whole will be persisted,

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,090
so however your layout was in your last project,
the window layout will be the same in this

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,980
new one. So, the easiest way to get back to
default is click at the top right, on the

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,739
button layout, and then, click Default. Now,
you'll be back at the Default Unity Layout.

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,200
We don't need the Console on the right hand
side anymore, that was just for a previous

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,580
project. OK fantastic! The other thing that
will get carried across are all of your Unity

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,480
Preferences, which are here on a Mac and they're
here on a PC. Thanks to Christo for pointing

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,980
this out for us. As you know, this course
is recorded on a Mac, and there are very few

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,260
differences between Macs and PCs, but things
like location of the Preferences Menu is an

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,500
example of one of the differences, so if there'
s difference that you would like me to insert

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,090
into the course, please do share it in the
discussions, like Christo has, and it would

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,739
be ideal if you didn't annotate it so that
I can annotate it myself, afterwards in a

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,760
way that's consistent with the course. So,
just a plain vanilla full screen screenshot

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,430
would be fantastic in the discussions, and
I'm happy to edit it into the course, like

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,250
I have done this bit. The only thing we have
changed is the colors. We've changed the Play

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,549
Mode Tint to whatever you chose, I chose a
red. What that means is, when you click play

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:55,030
the system will indicate all parts of the
interface where changes will be lost if you

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,099
are to make them during the play. So, you
need to stop playing before you play with

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:05,530
or change anything around here, around the
outside hierarchy, or Inspector, because those

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,459
are only temporary changes, and the reason
I changed the Play Mode Tint is to make that

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:16,009
really really clear to you. So, that's what
gets carried over. In summary, your current

00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:22,540
layout, and it's easy to reset as I just showed
you, and anything under your Unity Preferences,

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,270
i.e. the Play Mode Tint or anything else in
that Unity Preferences Dialog Box, which is

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:35,570
there. Any of these tabs, External Tools,
Colors, Keys, any of this stuff will get persisted,

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,570
when you start a new project. OK, so I hope
that's clear for you. The final thing we're

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:45,290
going to do, as I've promised, is to import
your Prison Image Asset. So, if you're anything

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,919
like me, you've downloaded your Prison Image
Asset, from a lecture very close to this one

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,310
in the course. Probably immediately before
this or before the Dame Design Document, and

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:02,009
when you download from that lecture, from
the Resources Button, you will see a prisonword.png

00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:09,770
or possibly .png.zip. If it's a .zip, obviously
just unzip it, so that you find this prisonword.png

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,600
file. If you double click it, it should look
something like this, it's just the word Prison.

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,229
And all I want you to do for now is just grab
that and drag it onto your Assets section

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:26,060
of Unity. So, that is under the Project Tab
at the bottom of the screen. You've then got

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,780
Assets, drag and let go in there, and what
you should find is you get prison world like

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,410
that, which you can click on and see in Unity.
When you drag this image in, just be absolutely

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:43,800
sure that it has come in as Texture Type Sprite brackets
2D and UI. Look up on the top right, under

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,150
your Inspector, with your prison word Image
selected over here, and just make sure this

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,570
says sprite. If it doesn't please click the
drop down and change it to Sprite brackets

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:59,680
2D and UI, as mine is. That's going to be
really important in a future video. The final

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,009
thing you're going to need to do is to actually
save your scene; it'll ask you to do this

00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:08,539
when you quit Unity. You know that it's not
saved, because firstly there's no scene here

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,479
in the Assets Folder, and secondly, it says
Untitled up here, which is your scene or level

00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:20,130
name. So, let's go ahead and say just Save
Scene in Unity, and it'll come up and say,

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,160
what do you want to call it? Well, it wants
to go in the Assets Folder, that's correct.

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,389
Let's just call it Game. This game is going
to have a single scene, so that's it. Now,

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,960
we have a new thing in our Assets Folder called
Game, and it looks like a Unity logo, and

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,560
that is a scene or a level and we're having
a single one here. So, now the real test is

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,080
if you try and quit Unity, then it should
just go and disappear like that, which is

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,150
just fine. So, that means that you have successfully
left Unity and nothing else needed saving

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,509
and it's all good to go, but for now, congratulations!
You've done really well in this video! You

00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,490
understand a lot more about creating and saving
projects and getting them to go where you

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,970
want them, you know actually getting control
over the directory. You have saved your Text101

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,319
project, you understand what gets carried
across and our image is in. So, well done

00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,710
and I'll see you in another video!
