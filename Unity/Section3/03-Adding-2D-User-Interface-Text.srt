00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,630
Hey welcome back! So, now we're going to use
the Unity Engine for the first time. We're

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,100
going to be adding 2D User Interface Text.
So, we're going to start off by adding a UI

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,590
Text Element into our scene. I'll show you
how to set the Camera Background Color, it'll

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,360
default to blue it needs to be black or it
would look better black. We'll then move and

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,890
scale our text and go on to show you how to
programmatically change it, before challenging

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,140
you two ways. Firstly, to change the text
only on key presses, using if statements,

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,050
that you should already know about, and secondly,
to add and scale the image we've given you

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:47,199
or an image of your choice. So, let's dive
in and take a look. The first thing we need

00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:53,069
to do is get a UI Text Element into our scene,
so this is probably the first time you've

00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:58,370
ever seen the Scene View in Unity. There's
a few things that I need to just make sure.

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,049
Firstly, I want to make sure you're in 2D
Scene View, so on the Scene Tab, if you click

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,150
2D or 3D. 3D will give you a different gizmo,
at the top right. It'll look 3 dimensional,

00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,580
and you will just better see perspective,
whereas when you click 2D and the button is

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,190
depressed, this gizmo will actually disappear
and you'll just see a grid system, which you

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,350
can zoom in and out with the mouse and a camera
in the middle of it. So, we want you in 2D,

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,740
because we're going to be doing a 2D game
here. Fantastic! So, let's add our Text Element.

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:38,140
We go to Text Object. Sorry, Game Object Menu,
UI, and then, text, so that's Game Object,

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,210
UI, Text. And that's what we want to add,
let's do that. Now, look what happens when

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:50,110
we add the UI Text, lots of crazy things happen.
You get let's start at the top, you get something

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,120
called a Canvas, in your Hierarchy on the
left, and inside of that you get the Text

00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,590
Element you asked for. And you also get something
called an Event System. Now, leave that Event

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,330
System there, we're not going to be making
use of it in this game, but it does need to

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,259
be there, so just leave it. The Canvas is
just for organizing all your objects, and

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,120
then, the Text Element is the thing we're
interested in, so that's where we're going

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,990
to focus. Now, at the bottom of your Inspector,
you may see Layout Properties. You can get

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,460
rid of that by just clicking. So, the other
thing I want you to check, quickly before

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,490
we look at the Canvas, is up at the top right.
You have a Layers Drop Down, just click on

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:31,380
that, and make sure that this little UI eye
is actually an eye. You'll notice the white

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,130
Canvas that you can just see, appears and
disappears. Another way to do it is just to

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,060
make sure everything is ticked, so we want
everything except for nothing, ticked in the

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,870
Layers. If you click Nothing, you wouldn't
see anything. If you click Everything, you

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,310
see everything. The important thing is that
this UI Layer, that we've just added, is visible.

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,680
The other thing to know, in your scene view,
is that we're very zoomed in at the moment.

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,740
You've got a white outline, depending on your
zoom level, which indicates your Text Box.

00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,760
Now, there are several ways to get the Text
Box filling the screen. One is to click into

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,340
the scene and to roll the mouse wheel forward,
if you have a mouse wheel, zooming out until

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,910
you get too it. Another way would be to double
click on the word Text, and that will go straight

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,250
to the Text Element or double click on the
Canvas, will go to the entire Canvas. So,

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,590
what's a Canvas? What's a Text Element? Well,
the Canvas is where we're going to be operating.

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,420
Our entire game is going to be inside a User
Interface Canvas, so I'm going to fill the

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,190
screen with that, and the Text Element is
actually, in my case, sitting outside here.

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,090
So, I want to move that Text Element into
the Canvas, just grab it and drag it. Now,

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,920
there are a couple of different tools that
could do that. One is this Transform Tool,

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,319
the second tool at the top left of Unity,
which could be selected with the W Key or

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,890
by just clicking on it, and you could then
grab the blue box and drag this in. Another

00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,930
way that you can move it is to use the UI
Element Tool, which is accessible through

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,760
the T Key, and then, you can also then just
drag. As we're doing UI stuff, it's probably

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,540
better to get in the habit of using the UI
Tool here. Fantastic! OK! So, let's just recap

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,090
what we're doing. We're trying to add some
text to the scene. So, what I told you we

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,090
would do is add UI Text, we've done that.
Secondly, setting the Camera Background Color.

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,090
Well, let's do that now. So, if we were to
run the game now, look what happens. We get

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:29,169
a Game View that says New Text, it's fuzzy
text and it's on a blue background. Now, we

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,280
want this to be on a black background. Why
is the background blue? It doesn't look blue,

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:41,070
over in the Scene View. It's because we're
getting the color of the text, the background,

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,540
the background of everything, from the camera,
so if we were to click on the Camera, you'll

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,470
see that it has a blue background color to
it, at the moment. Now, remember if you're

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,419
going to make a change to this background
color, you want to do it when your not in

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,050
Play Mode. That's the purpose of this red
tint. Let me show you why. If I change that

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,000
to black in Play Mode, and then, stop look
what happens. The moment I stop playing, it

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,350
goes back to blue, so this is why we must
make permanent changes outside of Play Mode.

00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,020
And then, we want to be able to change the
text, by a program, so let's move our text

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,440
box and resize it. Now, you'll only be able
to resize it if you're sufficiently well zoomed

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,720
in, so use the Right Mouse Button to drag
around, zoom into your Text Box, until you

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,070
get little blue handles, and then, grab those
handles. Now, as the thing gets bigger, you'll

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,590
better see the handles at increasing zoom
sizes. And what I want you to do is set the

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,550
Text Box, so that it fills, about two thirds
vertically, of the screen like that, and so

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,979
that it's centered. And you'll see it's centered,
because you'll get the blue snapping action,

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,460
when it's centered like that. Alright, so
now you have a Text Box in here, and I'm just

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,830
going to type, for the moment, some rubbish
in here. Lorem 2, there we go Now, why is

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,060
this text so ugly? It's partly because the
font size is far too small, so we'd need to

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,190
turn the font size up, by going into the
Inspector and dragging up the Font Size, and

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,400
that will make your text look a lot prettier.
Let's look in the Game View. That's getting

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,410
much better, so it's still not particularly
readable and that's to do with the colors

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,520
that we have on the text but it's much better
than it was before. So, let's just try setting

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,449
our Text Color to white, so you do that in
the Inspector by going Inspector Text Script,

00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:36,770
and then, down to Color, under paragraph and
make it white, in your color picker. Now,

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,610
that's much better. So, we have white text,
in the bottom of the box there. So, how are

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,970
we doing on our objectives for the video?
We've added text. We've set the Camera Background

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,460
Color, in Edit Mode not Play Mode. We've moved
and scaled our text around, do have a play

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,990
with that with the UI elements there, get
used to moving that around. The final thing

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,699
we need to do is programmatically change the
text on here, so how are we going to do that?

00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:06,620
Well, we're going to need a script to do that,
so here's our text. Where do you think we're

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,860
going to add a script that changes text? Well,
to me it makes sense to add that on the text

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,580
itself. So, go to the bottom of the Inspector,
when selected on Text, and Add a Component,

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:24,780
New Script, and I would say TextController
like that, with a capital T and a capital

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,960
C and no space. OK, that's because it is a
class, we always call all scripts or classes

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,389
capital T capital, letter at the start. OK,
so we have a TextController Script. Where's

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,639
it gone? It's in our Assets Folder. So, what
we need to do is work out how we're going

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:49,050
to get access to this text, so let's go into
our script and let's take a look. So, this

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,120
script currently doesn't have any access,
direct simple access, to the text. The way

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,600
that we're going to make it do that, is we're
going to do something called publicly exposing

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:08,550
the text. So, public Text text; OK. You're
going to need to add that line at the top

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,039
of your TextController class, above your Start
function at the same level. That's going to

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,960
make a variable called text of type Text,
available to all the methods inside the TextController.

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,500
Don't worry about what this class stuff means,
at the moment. Now, our text here should be

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:35,389
a different color, and the reason it's not
is we actually need to say using UnityEngine.U at the top hereI;

00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:40,820
and then, save. OK, and when we do that, every
time we do anything to do with Unity UI we're

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,730
going to have to put this line in at the top,
to bring in the User Interface information.

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,880
The text here has gone blue, which it means
it's recognized text. If I hadn't of put this

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,480
using UnityEngine.UI line in, look what happens,
the text is red. So, when your text is red,

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,330
you put UnityEngine.UI, the text goes blue,
it's recognized, and we're in good shape.

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,070
So, what we want to do on the Start here is
just make sure we've got access to the text.

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:12,360
And how do we do that? Well, it's simply text.text,
as it happens, = "Hello world"; Let's try

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,890
that with a semicolon on the end of the statement,
save our script remember, and go back to Unity.

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,950
We have this placeholder Lorem text in here,
now let's run, and what happens when we run?

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,260
Nothing. "Object reference not set to an instance
of an object". What's going on there? Well,

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,810
let's revisit the script. At the top here,
we said public Text text; Now, I told you

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:40,310
that that's making a variable that is available
to all of these methods, of type Text called

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:47,610
text. The problem is, where is it coming from?
To make the attachment between this text object

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:54,140
here and the actual text, we're going to bring
in, we have to do a slightly strange thing,

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,320
in the Inspector. Go to the bottom of your
Inspector, and you'll see that the TextController

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,130
Script, at the bottom here, is asking for
text. Well, just drag from your Hierarchy

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,269
the Text Element onto that. Now, there are
much more elegant ways of accessing this,

00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:12,330
which we'll talk about later, but for now,
I want you to get used to exposing things

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,580
when you need to and connecting them like
this, so we drag our text on there. Now, let's

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,839
try running. "Hello world!" Great! So, let's
recap how far we've got. We have programmatically

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,810
changed text. OK, next thing is we're going
to change text, only when we press a key.

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:39,779
Now, you have looked at if statements previously,
so what I want you to do is change or put

00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:45,040
in here an if statement, in the Update function,
so that it starts by saying "Hello world",

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:53,540
but if I press the Space Key, let's say then
it's going to change to Space Key pressed.

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,670
OK. So, I want you to put an if statement
around this command. I'm going to say text.text

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:06,230
= "Space key pressed"; This is going to be
set every frame, so right now if I run, we

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,910
won't see the "Hello world", because it goes
away immediately and keeps getting replaced

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,170
every single frame, with "Space key pressed."
OK, so what I want to happen is for "Space

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:21,260
key pressed' not to come up until you press
the Space Key, using an if statement around

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:32,750
line 16. So, I'll put the challenge definition
on the screen for you. There are some hints.

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,300
We're not actually starting with the text
blank, we're starting with "Hello world",

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,450
but that's OK and we're going to change to
"Key pressed", when we press the Space Key.

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:49,149
So, go ahead and do that challenge now. Pause
the video. OK, how did you get on? Let me

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,240
show you how I'm going to do that simple challenge.
What we do is we come back in here and we

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,850
say if and then the brackets. Now, I like
to do all my brackets to start with, the brackets

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,910
are like that remember; if is a statement,
it takes in a condition, and it has a code

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,180
block. I'm going to put the code I only want
to execute with the if happens inside the

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:19,420
code block, and then, I'm going to write my
condition, which is (Input.GetKeyDown and

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:25,760
then (KeyCode.Space)) That's how we're going
to be doing that. Make sure you have as many

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,079
closing circular brackets as you do opening.
Save your script and let's try now. What we

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,579
hope will happen, is when we first run, it
says "Hello world!", when I hit Space it changes

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:43,850
to "Space key pressed!". Fantastic! Congratulations!
Let's look back at the script, make sure we

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,820
understand how that works. This whole script
gets called, because it's a script on an object

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,529
in the game, so that's what is going to happen.&nbsp;It's
hanging off the Text Object. At the Start

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:59,660
of the game, it sets the text to "Hello world",
and then, every single frame it asks the question,

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,800
have we currently got the Space Key down?
If not, it does nothing it skips right over

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,760
this code block right down to here. If we
have got the Space Key down, then it changes

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,360
the text to "Space key pressed". OK, as a
final challenge for you I want you to get

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,750
this image onto the Canvas and then, scale
it appropriately. Now, I'm going to have to

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,950
tell you how to do that. You could just drag
it on, but if you just drag it on it's going

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,430
to become the wrong type of thing, and you
can tell that because the Transform is not

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:37,430
the same as the Text, which is a Wrecked Transform. So that's not how to do it.
You're going to need to go Game Object, UI,

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,800
Image, so let's do that. Then, the image comes
under the Canvas, and then, what I want you

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,510
to do is replace this white image with this
Prison Word Sprite here. OK, so I want you

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,730
to drag the Prison Word Sprite, this thing
here, onto that, and then I want you to resize

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,220
it so it looks decent, using the UI Element
Tool, so that it's taking up about a third

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,990
of the screen, at the top and it kind of looks
the right proportions. So, in summary what

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:11,300
I want you to do is add an image to the Canvass,
scale it to around 1/3 of the height, center

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,139
it on the Canvas, ensure the background of
the image is transparent, if you're using

00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:24,459
the image we supply it will be, and then,
make sure your game runs. So, how did you

00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,180
get on? Hopefully you've managed to do that.
This is how I did it. I just simply stuck

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,709
the image on, and I'm going to grab it, drag
it, until it looks about right, move it till

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:40,769
it snaps to the center, and then, just click
play to make sure my game is running. How

00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:45,139
do I know the background is transparent? Well,
try putting it over the text for a minute.

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,170
You can see the background of the image we
supplied. Well, you can see it here in the

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,350
Scene View is transparent, because we can
see the text behind. So, fantastic! You've

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,860
had a very good video here, I believe. You've
learned a lot, and hopefully you're a lot

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,589
more confident with UI Elements now. Here's
what we learned, and I look forward to seeing

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:04,820
you in a future video.
