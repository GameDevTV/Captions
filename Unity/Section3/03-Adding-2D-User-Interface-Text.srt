1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,666


2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:08,599
Hey welcome back! So, now we're going to use
the Unity Engine for the first time. We're

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,100
going to be adding 2D User Interface Text.
So, we're going to start off by adding a UI

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,566
Text Element into our scene. I'll show you
how to set the Camera Background Color, it'll

5
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:23,332
default to blue it needs to be black or it
would look better black. We'll then move and

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:28,866
scale our text and go on to show you how to
programmatically change it, before challenging

7
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:35,132
you two ways. Firstly, to change the text
only on key presses, using if statements,

8
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:40,033
that you should already know about, and secondly,
to add and scale the image we've given you

9
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:47,199
or an image of your choice. So, let's dive
in and take a look. The first thing we need

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,066
to do is get a UI Text Element into our scene,
so this is probably the first time you've

11
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:58,366
ever seen the Scene View in Unity. There's
a few things that I need to just make sure.

12
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:04,032
Firstly, I want to make sure you're in 2D
Scene View, so on the Scene Tab, if you click

13
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:10,133
2D or 3D. 3D will give you a different gizmo,
at the top right. It'll look 3 dimensional,

14
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:14,566
and you will just better see perspective,
whereas when you click 2D and the button is

15
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:20,166
depressed, this gizmo will actually disappear
and you'll just see a grid system, which you

16
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:24,332
can zoom in and out with the mouse and a camera
in the middle of it. So, we want you in 2D,

17
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:29,733
because we're going to be doing a 2D game
here. Fantastic! So, let's add our Text Element.

18
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:38,133
We go to Text Object. Sorry, Game Object Menu,
UI, and then, text, so that's Game Object,

19
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:44,199
UI, Text. And that's what we want to add,
let's do that. Now, look what happens when

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,100
we add the UI Text, lots of crazy things happen.
You get let's start at the top, you get something

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,100
called a Canvas, in your Hierarchy on the
left, and inside of that you get the Text

22
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,566
Element you asked for. And you also get something
called an Event System. Now, leave that Event

23
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:02,299
System there, we're not going to be making
use of it in this game, but it does need to

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,233
be there, so just leave it. The Canvas is
just for organizing all your objects, and

25
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:11,099
then, the Text Element is the thing we're
interested in, so that's where we're going

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,966
to focus. Now, at the bottom of your Inspector,
you may see Layout Properties. You can get

27
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:21,432
rid of that by just clicking. So, the other
thing I want you to check, quickly before

28
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,466
we look at the Canvas, is up at the top right.
You have a Layers Drop Down, just click on

29
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:31,366
that, and make sure that this little UI eye
is actually an eye. You'll notice the white

30
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:35,099
Canvas that you can just see, appears and
disappears. Another way to do it is just to

31
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,033
make sure everything is ticked, so we want
everything except for nothing, ticked in the

32
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,866
Layers. If you click Nothing, you wouldn't
see anything. If you click Everything, you

33
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:47,299
see everything. The important thing is that
this UI Layer, that we've just added, is visible.

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,666
The other thing to know, in your scene view,
is that we're very zoomed in at the moment.

35
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,732
You've got a white outline, depending on your
zoom level, which indicates your Text Box.

36
00:02:56,733 --> 00:03:00,733
Now, there are several ways to get the Text
Box filling the screen. One is to click into

37
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:05,333
the scene and to roll the mouse wheel forward,
if you have a mouse wheel, zooming out until

38
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:10,899
you get too it. Another way would be to double
click on the word Text, and that will go straight

39
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,233
to the Text Element or double click on the
Canvas, will go to the entire Canvas. So,

40
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:20,566
what's a Canvas? What's a Text Element? Well,
the Canvas is where we're going to be operating.

41
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:24,399
Our entire game is going to be inside a User
Interface Canvas, so I'm going to fill the

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,166
screen with that, and the Text Element is
actually, in my case, sitting outside here.

43
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:34,066
So, I want to move that Text Element into
the Canvas, just grab it and drag it. Now,

44
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:38,899
there are a couple of different tools that
could do that. One is this Transform Tool,

45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,300
the second tool at the top left of Unity,
which could be selected with the W Key or

46
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,866
by just clicking on it, and you could then
grab the blue box and drag this in. Another

47
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:54,899
way that you can move it is to use the UI
Element Tool, which is accessible through

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,733
the T Key, and then, you can also then just
drag. As we're doing UI stuff, it's probably

49
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:07,533
better to get in the habit of using the UI
Tool here. Fantastic! OK! So, let's just recap

50
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:11,066
what we're doing. We're trying to add some
text to the scene. So, what I told you we

51
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:17,066
would do is add UI Text, we've done that.
Secondly, setting the Camera Background Color.

52
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:23,066
Well, let's do that now. So, if we were to
run the game now, look what happens. We get

53
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:29,166
a Game View that says New Text, it's fuzzy
text and it's on a blue background. Now, we

54
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:33,266
want this to be on a black background. Why
is the background blue? It doesn't look blue,

55
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:41,066
over in the Scene View. It's because we're
getting the color of the text, the background,

56
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:46,532
the background of everything, from the camera,
so if we were to click on the Camera, you'll

57
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:51,466
see that it has a blue background color to
it, at the moment. Now, remember if you're

58
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:55,399
going to make a change to this background
color, you want to do it when your not in

59
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,033
Play Mode. That's the purpose of this red
tint. Let me show you why. If I change that

60
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,999
to black in Play Mode, and then, stop look
what happens. The moment I stop playing, it

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,333
goes back to blue, so this is why we must
make permanent changes outside of Play Mode.

62
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:16,999
And then, we want to be able to change the
text, by a program, so let's move our text

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,433
box and resize it. Now, you'll only be able
to resize it if you're sufficiently well zoomed

64
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:28,699
in, so use the Right Mouse Button to drag
around, zoom into your Text Box, until you

65
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,066
get little blue handles, and then, grab those
handles. Now, as the thing gets bigger, you'll

66
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,566
better see the handles at increasing zoom
sizes. And what I want you to do is set the

67
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:44,532
Text Box, so that it fills, about two thirds
vertically, of the screen like that, and so

68
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:48,966
that it's centered. And you'll see it's centered,
because you'll get the blue snapping action,

69
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:53,432
when it's centered like that. Alright, so
now you have a Text Box in here, and I'm just

70
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:59,799
going to type, for the moment, some rubbish
in here. Lorem 2, there we go Now, why is

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,033
this text so ugly? It's partly because the
font size is far too small, so we'd need to

72
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:11,166
turn the font size up, by going into the
Inspector and dragging up the Font Size, and

73
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:15,399
that will make your text look a lot prettier.
Let's look in the Game View. That's getting

74
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,400
much better, so it's still not particularly
readable and that's to do with the colors

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,500
that we have on the text but it's much better
than it was before. So, let's just try setting

76
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,433
our Text Color to white, so you do that in
the Inspector by going Inspector Text Script,

77
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:36,766
and then, down to Color, under paragraph and
make it white, in your color picker. Now,

78
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:40,599
that's much better. So, we have white text,
in the bottom of the box there. So, how are

79
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,966
we doing on our objectives for the video?
We've added text. We've set the Camera Background

80
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:51,432
Color, in Edit Mode not Play Mode. We've moved
and scaled our text around, do have a play

81
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:55,966
with that with the UI elements there, get
used to moving that around. The final thing

82
00:06:55,966 --> 00:07:01,699
we need to do is programmatically change the
text on here, so how are we going to do that?

83
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,600
Well, we're going to need a script to do that,
so here's our text. Where do you think we're

84
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,833
going to add a script that changes text? Well,
to me it makes sense to add that on the text

85
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:17,566
itself. So, go to the bottom of the Inspector,
when selected on Text, and Add a Component,

86
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:24,766
New Script, and I would say TextController
like that, with a capital T and a capital

87
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:30,932
C and no space. OK, that's because it is a
class, we always call all scripts or classes

88
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:36,366
capital T capital, letter at the start. OK,
so we have a TextController Script. Where's

89
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:41,632
it gone? It's in our Assets Folder. So, what
we need to do is work out how we're going

90
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:49,033
to get access to this text, so let's go into
our script and let's take a look. So, this

91
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:55,099
script currently doesn't have any access,
direct simple access, to the text. The way

92
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,600
that we're going to make it do that, is we're
going to do something called publicly exposing

93
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:08,533
the text. So, public Text text; OK. You're
going to need to add that line at the top

94
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:13,033
of your TextController class, above your Start
function at the same level. That's going to

95
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:20,933
make a variable called text of type Text,
available to all the methods inside the TextController.

96
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:20,999
Don't worry about what this class stuff means,
at the moment. Now, our text here should be

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Because Line 6 causes quite a lot of confusion, I just want to walk through it

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
once more from left to right carefully. So firstly the word

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
public. The word public is an "access modifier"

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This makes this Text field visible in the inspector

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
so that we can actually change the value over in Unity in a very

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
human and organic way. The next word Text with a capital T

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
(you need to tune your eye into that capital T). This is a type

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and it of type Text.

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The next word text with a small t, is just the variable name we are using.

106
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We could choose anything, and perhaps we could chose something less confusing than 

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
text, but I'm using the same word because what matters is that

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you read the code the way the compiler reads the code, and that is

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it depends on the order of the words. Public is the access modifier, next

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
it's expecting a type, Text with a capital T, then it's expecting

111
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,300
you to provide any valid variable name, and I'm using text. We could choose

112
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,800
something else but our compiler is gonna expect that to be a variable name. Now, our text here should be

113
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:35,666
a different color, and the reason it's not
is we actually need to say using UnityEngine.U at the top hereI;

114
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:41,099
and then, save. OK, and when we do that, every
time we do anything to do with Unity UI we're

115
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,000
going to have to put this line in at the top,
to bring in the User Interface information.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,166
The text here has gone blue, which it means
it's recognized text. If I hadn't of put this

117
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:55,766
using UnityEngine.UI line in, look what happens,
the text is red. So, when your text is red,

118
00:09:55,766 --> 00:10:01,599
you put UnityEngine.UI, the text goes blue,
it's recognized, and we're in good shape.

119
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,366
So, what we want to do on the Start here is
just make sure we've got access to the text.

120
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:12,632
And how do we do that? Well, it's simply text.text,
as it happens, = "Hello world"; Let's try

121
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:18,166
that with a semicolon on the end of the statement,
save our script remember, and go back to Unity.

122
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:24,232
We have this placeholder Lorem text in here,
now let's run, and what happens when we run?

123
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:30,533
Nothing. "Object reference not set to an instance
of an object". What's going on there? Well,

124
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:35,099
let's revisit the script. At the top here,
we said public Text text; Now, I told you

125
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,600
that that's making a variable that is available
to all of these methods, of type Text called

126
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,900
text. The problem is, where is it coming from?
To make the attachment between this text object

127
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,433
here and the actual text, we're going to bring
in, we have to do a slightly strange thing,

128
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:59,599
in the Inspector. Go to the bottom of your
Inspector, and you'll see that the TextController

129
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,400
Script, at the bottom here, is asking for
text. Well, just drag from your Hierarchy

130
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,566
the Text Element onto that. Now, there are
much more elegant ways of accessing this,

131
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:12,599
which we'll talk about later, but for now,
I want you to get used to exposing things

132
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,866
when you need to and connecting them like
this, so we drag our text on there. Now, let's

133
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:25,132
try running. "Hello world!" Great! So, let's
recap how far we've got. We have programmatically

134
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:32,099
changed text. OK, next thing is we're going
to change text, only when we press a key.

135
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:40,066
Now, you have looked at if statements previously,
so what I want you to do is change or put

136
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:45,332
in here an if statement, in the Update function,
so that it starts by saying "Hello world",

137
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:53,833
but if I press the Space Key, let's say then
it's going to change to Space Key pressed.

138
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:58,966
OK. So, I want you to put an if statement
around this command. I'm going to say text.text

139
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:06,499
= "Space key pressed"; This is going to be
set every frame, so right now if I run, we

140
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,200
won't see the "Hello world", because it goes
away immediately and keeps getting replaced

141
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,466
every single frame, with "Space key pressed."
OK, so what I want to happen is for "Space

142
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:21,532
key pressed' not to come up until you press
the Space Key, using an if statement around

143
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:33,033
line 16. So, I'll put the challenge definition
on the screen for you. There are some hints.

144
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,599
We're not actually starting with the text
blank, we're starting with "Hello world",

145
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,733
but that's OK and we're going to change to
"Key pressed", when we press the Space Key.

146
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:49,433
So, go ahead and do that challenge now. Pause
the video. OK, how did you get on? Let me

147
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:54,533
show you how I'm going to do that simple challenge.
What we do is we come back in here and we

148
00:12:54,533 --> 00:13:01,133
say if and then the brackets. Now, I like
to do all my brackets to start with, the brackets

149
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:06,199
are like that remember; if is a statement,
it takes in a condition, and it has a code

150
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,466
block. I'm going to put the code I only want
to execute with the if happens inside the

151
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:19,699
code block, and then, I'm going to write my
condition, which is (Input.GetKeyDown and

152
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,033
then (KeyCode.Space)) That's how we're going
to be doing that. Make sure you have as many

153
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:32,366
closing circular brackets as you do opening.
Save your script and let's try now. What we

154
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:38,866
hope will happen, is when we first run, it
says "Hello world!", when I hit Space it changes

155
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:44,132
to "Space key pressed!". Fantastic! Congratulations!
Let's look back at the script, make sure we

156
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:50,099
understand how that works. This whole script
gets called, because it's a script on an object

157
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,800
in the game, so that's what is going to happen.&nbsp;It's
hanging off the Text Object. At the Start

158
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,933
of the game, it sets the text to "Hello world",
and then, every single frame it asks the question,

159
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:04,099
have we currently got the Space Key down?
If not, it does nothing it skips right over

160
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:10,033
this code block right down to here. If we
have got the Space Key down, then it changes

161
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:15,633
the text to "Space key pressed". OK, as a
final challenge for you I want you to get

162
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:21,033
this image onto the Canvas and then, scale
it appropriately. Now, I'm going to have to

163
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:26,233
tell you how to do that. You could just drag
it on, but if you just drag it on it's going

164
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:30,699
to become the wrong type of thing, and you
can tell that because the Transform is not

165
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,700
the same as the Text, which is a Wrecked Transform. So that's not how to do it.
You're going to need to go Game Object, UI,

166
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,100
Image, so let's do that. Then, the image comes
under the Canvas, and then, what I want you

167
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:49,800
to do is replace this white image with this
Prison Word Sprite here. OK, so I want you

168
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,000
to drag the Prison Word Sprite, this thing
here, onto that, and then I want you to resize

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,500
it so it looks decent, using the UI Element
Tool, so that it's taking up about a third

170
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,266
of the screen, at the top and it kind of looks
the right proportions. So, in summary what

171
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:11,599
I want you to do is add an image to the Canvass,
scale it to around 1/3 of the height, center

172
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,433
it on the Canvas, ensure the background of
the image is transparent, if you're using

173
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:24,733
the image we supply it will be, and then,
make sure your game runs. So, how did you

174
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:29,466
get on? Hopefully you've managed to do that.
This is how I did it. I just simply stuck

175
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:33,999
the image on, and I'm going to grab it, drag
it, until it looks about right, move it till

176
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,066
it snaps to the center, and then, just click
play to make sure my game is running. How

177
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:45,432
do I know the background is transparent? Well,
try putting it over the text for a minute.

178
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:48,466
You can see the background of the image we
supplied. Well, you can see it here in the

179
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:53,632
Scene View is transparent, because we can
see the text behind. So, fantastic! You've

180
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:58,133
had a very good video here, I believe. You've
learned a lot, and hopefully you're a lot

181
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:03,866
more confident with UI Elements now. Here's
what we learned, and I look forward to seeing

182
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,066
you in a future video.
