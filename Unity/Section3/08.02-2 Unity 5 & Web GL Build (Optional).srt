00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:08,466
Hi, I'm Sam and you may not have heard from me before, but I'm

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:12,466
helping you out with upgrading the Text 101 project

3
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:16,466
to Unity 5. I'm going to be showing you how to do that in

4
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:20,466
this lecture, and I'm also going to be showing you about the cool new build

5
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:24,466
target that we have in Unity 5, which is Web GL, and that is here.

6
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:28,466
It basically allows you to run your games in a browser, without any plugins

7
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:32,466
installed. OK, so let's have a go at that and dive right in!

8
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:36,466
So, the first thing you'll notice here is that I have two versions of Unity

9
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:40,466
installed. This is relatively straightforward to do, even on a PC.

10
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:44,466
What we need to really do is rename this folder, before

11
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:48,466
installing. And the default folder, where you installed, is called Unity,

12
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:52,466
and then, you can rename that folder too, so you can keep track of which versions

13
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:56,466
of Unity you have. This is great if you are going through sections

14
00:00:56,466 --> 00:01:00,466
which are on Unity 4, then you want to stay in Unity 4 so that you're on the same

15
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:04,466
version as Ben. Otherwise, if you want to

16
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:08,466
try and upgrade things into Unity 5, you want this Unity 5 version as well.

17
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:12,466
So, that's what we're going to be using today. I'm going to fire that up!

18
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:16,466
As you can see, this screen looks a little bit different from Unity 4, and

19
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:20,466
if we go to open our project, if you don't

20
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:24,466
already have it open, we can go and find that folder. Hit Open

21
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:28,466
and what it's going to do is, it's going to prompt us to upgrade.

22
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:32,466
Now, this is a very cleaver little tool that will even reach into your code

23
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:36,466
and change that as necessary, refactor that as necessary, in order

24
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:40,466
to make the API work. There are some things that it can't do, but

25
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:44,466
for the most part, it will actually be able to do a good job of upgrading your project

26
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:48,466
for you. So, let's hit that button and see what happens, and then, I'll

27
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:52,466
walk you through some of the changes that it has made to the

28
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:56,466
project folder. OK, so as you can see, everything seems to be working. If

29
00:01:56,466 --> 00:02:00,466
we open up the Game scene and hit play, it's

30
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:04,466
indeed exactly the same game as we left it. Now, I'm going to

31
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:08,466
go into an app called SourceTree, which is

32
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:12,466
here, and SourceTree basically just

33
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,466
keeps track of changes to my files in the project. So,

34
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:20,466
here are the changes, since we've done the upgrade, and you can see them in this little

35
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:24,466
area over here. No code changes,

36
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:28,466
none of these are code files. There are a few, these question mark files are new files,

37
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:32,466
and basically, they are

38
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:36,466
things like well Clusterinput, we're not really interested in. Project

39
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:40,466
Version is quite interesting, because now this file tracks which

40
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:44,466
version you were using when you created this project. Unity adds and

41
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:48,466
connects our new services by Unity, and then, obviously the project settings have

42
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:52,466
changed in format slightly and that's what's been upgraded there. But

43
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:56,466
not really very much to speak of, and certainly no code changes. We'll

44
00:02:56,466 --> 00:03:00,466
be seeing code changes in later sections, but in this one very

45
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:04,466
simple game, very simple upgrade process as well.

46
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,900
So, let's take a look at one of the really cool new features, that is available

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,900
in Unity 5. So, I'm going to switch over to Unity,

48
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,900
and then, I'm going to go to File, Build & Run.

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,900
In fact, I'm going to go to Build Settings, rather, and

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,900
I'm going to go to select the WebGL

51
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,900
platform. Now, this is new, you won't have had this in Unity 4,

52
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,900
but what this does is, essentially like the Web Payer but allows you to run it without

53
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,900
installing plugins, so it does it entirely using web technology,

54
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,900
the new WebGL technology in fact. So, if we select this

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,900
as our build platform, and then, we hit Build And Run,

56
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,900
we want to create a build folder here. So, I'm going to create a new folder,

57
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,900
call it Build, and in here I'm just going to give it the

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,900
name of Text101, simple.

59
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Save that and it's just going to go through the build

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,900
process very quickly. And it's very cleaver, it's going to be compiling down to Java

61
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,900
script, which is the language of the web, and once that's done, it

62
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,900
should pop up a browser window for us to play our game in.

63
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:18,333
As you can see now, it's actually compiling that C++ code that it was just generating

64
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:22,333
into Java script, as I said, and after this step,

65
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:26,333
it should be done. Now, how long this takes is going to depend

66
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,333
very much on the speed of your computer, but it shouldn't take longer than about

67
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,766
5 minutes in general.

68
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:36,766
And this is the result! A webpage just pops up

69
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:40,766
and allows us to play the prison game, just like

70
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:44,766
this, right there in our web browser. And there is no plugin installed

71
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:48,766
here. I don't have a plugin installed, like Ben does, so you can know for sure that

72
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:52,333
this is just using standard web technologies.

73
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,633
OK, now it is your turn to

74
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:59,633
create this Web GL build and share it with your friends. I'd like you to

75
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,633
check your game in Unity 5 very carefully. Make sure there are no bugs that

76
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,633
have been introduced by the upgrade process. Then, I'd like you to make

77
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,633
a Web GL build, just as I've shown you, using these

78
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:15,633
instructions and share that build on social media for your

79
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,633
friends. OK, so you can pause the video, have a go at this, and

80
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:23,633
when you're done, it is time to move on to the next video.
