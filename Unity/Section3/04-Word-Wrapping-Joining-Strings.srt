00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.070
Welcome back! So. in this video we're going
to be talking about word wrapping. when we

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.850
have a long string of like this Lorem Ipsum
Text. we have here in this Text Box. It's

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.689
all very well. when we try and set this directly
in the User Interface. but I want to talk

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.679
about what's going to happen when we try and
set long strings in code and how we're going

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.999
to deal with that. in our code. So. let's
firstly stay here in the User Interface for

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.800
a minute and just have a quick look at a setting.
In your Inspector. when you're selected on

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.579
your Text Field. you will see under the Text
Box that you have an option. if you scroll

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.719
down. that says Horizontal Overflow under
Paragraph. And it's currently set to Wrap.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.910
If we were to set that to Overflow. look what
happens to the text. if I zoom out. it's just

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.090
one long line. It ignores the fact that it's
escaping the right hand side of the Text Box.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.230
So. you're going to want that on wrap. if
you want to see it all. Alright. so now let's

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.280
imagine we want to set a slightly longer story
scene. because we're trying to build a text

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.310
adventure here. and we want to do that programmatically.
so let's see where we are with our script.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.090
So far. when we hit the Space Key. in this
condition. we are just saying "Space key pressed".

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:21.250
Let's try pasting all of that Lorem Text in
there. with a semicolon on the end. Now. let's

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.610
just have a look. it's a horrible dirt to deal with.
so text.text =. Now. I've got to scroll all

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.790
the way across. I don't want to close brackets.
I need to make sure I've got a semicolon on

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.680
the end of the statement. Now. let's just
see if that works; I think you'll find that

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.649
it'll work OK. but let's just make sure. How
are we going to know. by the way? Because

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.869
it's going to start with the Lorem Text. and
then. end up with the Lorem Text. when we

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.399
hit Space. so I'm going to take it out in
Unity. So. what we have now. in the starting

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.320
state. is no text. And then. if we look over
at our script. it's going to go to "Hello

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.680
world" on Start. so we'll know that's working
and then. it's going to go to this very long

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.399
string. when we hit the Space Key. Let's see all
this happening. click play. "Hello world!".

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.880
as expected. Now. let's hit the Space Key.
OK. now our Lorem Text comes in just fine.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.649
if we paste it into the script. so that's
good. and the wrapping continues to work as

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.140
we left it. The problem I have here is I don't
really want any of my script to be more than

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.400
a screen width. and having to scroll all the
way across to see my text is just horribly

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.590
unusable. Now. I'm afraid there's no really
elegant solution to this. without doing something

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.010
pretty esoteric. so I'm just going to show
you how I suggest we layout text. in script.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.230
Alright. so what we're going to do is we're
going to say well. where have we got about

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.819
a screen full. over here somewhere. and we're
going to close the string. put a + on the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.129
end of the line. and then. remembering that
C# ignores white space. we can put a new line

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.110
in. Now. we've got a style question as to
where do we start typing the next line. Well.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.260
I'm going to indent it to the same level as
the previous quote was on the line above.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.870
and I'm going to put some quotes in like that.
Now. we need to be careful with our spaces.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.010
there's either a space on the end or the beginning.
better to have the space to my eye on the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.390
end of the previous line. So. that's the pattern
you want to continue in. Let's just make sure

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.620
that this works for one concatenation or join
of the strings. and then. we'll talk about

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.890
what to do next. Let's check it. "Hello world!".
yep. all fine. this transition is happening

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.319
just fine. Great! So. hopefully you can see
what's happening here. We have a statement

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.819
here. we have a + on the end. C# is ignoring
the white space. it would be exactly the same

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.150
if we left it like that where we just have
a close of quotes and reopening of the quotes.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.260
You'd say what's the point? You'd be quite
right. what's the point if it's all on one

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.049
line? But the point is that if we want to
put it on two lines. then we need to do this.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.680
You may say why don't we just leave the quotes
and the + out. like that and just put a new

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.290
line. Let's see what happens. if we do that.
It just won't compile. it says we've got a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.689
new line in constant. You can't put a new
line in the definition of this Text Element.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.019
Alright. so you're going to have to close
the quotes and concatenate. So. this is the

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.970
best we've got for you in terms of how you
build a long text string. So by this pattern.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.920
what I would like you to do. I'll do just
the next one for you. is I would like you

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.600
to repeat this for the rest of the string.
alright. so that none of it runs off the end

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.670
of the screen. A little mini challenge for
you. Pause the video and continue to bring

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.350
all of this string down into a single screen
width. Now. while you're at it. why not start

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.350
writing your story. Why use my horrible Lorem
Text? Certainly don't sit and try and write

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.860
that out. Start writing your own story into
here. Now. I'm going to pause the video. write

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.050
my own story into this paragraph. and then.
I'll see you when we have both written our

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.260
first screen of story. This is your starting
screen on your story. in my case my prisoner

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.960
in his cell.See you soon. So. welcome back! So. here's
my little story. You're in a prison cell and

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.240
you want to escape. There are some dirty sheets
on the bed. a mirror on the wall. and the

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.880
door is locked from the outside. You may have
the question. how do I actually put a new

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.610
line in now. if I want to. because you may
want to go on to give the user some instructions

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.330
about what they can do. So. here is how you
put a new line in. You use a back slash like

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.320
that. and then. an n and it should come up
in red. like that. And you may end up needing

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.880
two of them. So. if you do that. then you're
going to want to just continue in this pattern

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:38.250
now. something like this. So. press. I don't
know. M or L to look at mirror. What we need

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.570
to do here by the way. is look at our Game
Design Document and see what we decided in

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.370
our State Transition Diagram. So. we're in
the cell and there are some sheets. so V for

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.870
view R for return. so let's make that happen
over in the text. "Press V to view sheets".

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.690
Now. let's look at our State Diagram again.
See we need to modify our State Diagram. take

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.910
a look at this. and you realize and this stage
it's all very well saying view you're sheets

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.970
and return. view the mirror and return. but
look. if we're using V for view. what are

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.750
we viewing. OK. so we're going to need to
us S for sheets. M for mirror. and L for lock.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.970
So. if you've got your own sketch diagram.
go ahead and change that. otherwise I will

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.660
change mine now. This is exactly the sort
of thing you'll come across. you draw a diagram.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.630
it seems logical at the time. but when you
come to implement it there is an issue that

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.480
doesn't make sense. so just update your diagram.
So. I'm going to go ahead and update the diagram

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.220
now. OK. so I've made that improvement in
my diagram. Take a look now. Let's start with

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.540
the cell. Do we have a unique key press every
transition we want to make? S for sheets.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.160
M for mirror. L for lock yeah. and if you
were to look around the diagram. you'd find

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.490
the same for mirror. For mirror. once we have
the mirror. you know once we're looking at

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.300
the mirror. we could T for take or R to return
and so on. Cell mirror is where we're in the

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.740
cell. holding the mirror. at which point we
can S to look at the sheets. holding the mirror.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.650
We can M to. I'm sorry. L to go to the lock.
OK. I'll change that to L for lock and you

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.400
can see that you have a unique key press for
every state. which is what we want. OK. fantastic!

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.370
So. let's go back to our code. and now. we
know what we're going to say. This is the

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.820
value of planning. so V to view sheets. well
it's S to view sheets right. "S to view Sheets.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:30.200
press M to view Mirror and L to view Lock."
Now. before we carry on. check it back at

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.160
our diagram. I'm just going to change this
to lock for us. one second. The mirror becomes

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.800
lock. Now. how do you draw your game design
diagram documents is entirely up to you? You

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.620
may want to use a piece of paper. a notebook.
you may want to use Google Documents. you

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:50.120
may want to use Word. whatever you like as
long as it works for you. OK. so we have S.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:59.100
M. and L. Let's just check that that's right.
S. M. and L. OK. and I'm putting the capital

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.590
letter in front of Sheets. Mirror. and Lock.
just to emphasize that the L goes with Lock.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:09.110
the M goes with Mirror. and the S goes with
Sheets. Fantastic! Let's look at this in action

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:17.930
now. Hit the Space Bar. You're in a prison.
blah blah. OK fantastic! So. that's it really.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.860
we've done what we want to do here. We've
understood a lot more about long strings.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.220
about how they fit in UI Text Elements. about
Wrapping in terms of the Paragraph Horizontal

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:34.860
Overflow. and then. over in code we found
a way of dealing with paragraphs of text by

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.630
concatenating in consecutive lines like this.
being careful with our spaced. inside the

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:46.630
quotes. And by using backslash n as the escaped
new line character. in order to insert new

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.260
lines. I've put two new lines in. because
if you look in the game. there are actually

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.660
two new lines. One brings you onto this next
line. after the first paragraph. The next

00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:00.030
new line creates that nice separation between
the description and the affordance. as to

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.880
what you should be doing next. So. well done
with that! You've learned a lot that lesson.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.180
and I'll see you shortly!
