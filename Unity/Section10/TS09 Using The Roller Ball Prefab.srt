00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,470
Hello hello hello and welcome back! We're
going to be talking about using the RollerBall

00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:11,180
prefab! We will import the Character's Standard
Asset Pack, again! We'll use the RollerBall

00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,840
prefab, and explore how it works basically!
And then, after this lecture, we've got a

00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,279
treat for you! We're going to start talking
about Replay Mechanics. OK, so let's get into

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,009
the Roller Ball. Here we go! Let's Import
the Standard Asset Pack for the characters.

00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:29,579
Now, we've used this before, a couple of times.
We've used it twice in Zombie Runner, actually

00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:35,440
once for the AI Third Person Character Controller
and once for the First Person Character Controller.

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,500
Now, we're going to use another character
controller, which is a RollerBall, so here

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,400
it comes, bloating out our Unity project.
By the way, the extra information that comes

00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,080
in when you import all this stuff, does not
get built into a build, like a Web Build or

00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,900
a Mac or PC Build, unless you specifically
use those items. So, it may bloat your project,

00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,870
but it doesn't bloat your final build. Alright,
so I'm going to get rid of my old ball. Just

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,480
before you delete something like that, especially
when it's not a prefab, just have a look at

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,250
the Inspector, make sure it hasn't got anything
clever on it. It's got a script, that won't

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
go. So, that's all good, let's just zap it.
And then, under Standard Assets, Characters,

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,710
RollerBall here, you have a RollerBall prefab.
Let's stick that in the scene. Fantastic!

00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:24,260
Now, what I'm going to do with this beam is
just drop it down a little bit, I think. How

00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,909
wide is it? It's too high. Nah, I that's OK,
no I'll leave it there. I'll leave it there.

00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:32,250
I'm going to put the RollerBall right on top
of it. What happens if I put the RollerBall

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,390
at 0, 0, 0? Well, it sits there. I would rather
the floor was at 0, so I'm going to move,

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,750
I am going to move the beam down by -1.5.
There you go, so all we've done is move the

00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,770
beam down to -1.5 and popped the RollerBall
at the origin. So, the RollerBall is quite

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,270
fun, It has like a tennis ball kind of relief
to it. It actually has three dimensionality

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,700
to it, but it also has a lot of stuff on it.
Take a look at this RollerBall. It has a Mesh

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,460
Filter and a Renderer, and a Collider and
a Rigidbody, but it also has a Ball Script

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,630
and a Ball User Control Script. And actually,
it's all cross platform ready anyway, which

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,459
is fantastic! So, there's our RollerBall.
How's our camera looking? Not so clever, so

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm going to align the Main Camera like that.
You select the Main Camera, Game Object, Align

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,750
with View, and then, it will look a bit like
the Scene View, very like the Scene View.

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,280
So, now if I play the game and use the arrow
keys, ah hah! Now, first thing that happens

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,510
using either the Cursor Keys or W, S, A, D
or even using the your Control Pad, is that

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,180
the ball falls off the side, so the first
thing I want to show you here is, how do we

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,280
constrain an object's movement to 2D. Well,
the Physics Engine has a very useful facility

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,989
for this, and this is at the heart of making
a 2 and a half D game, in a way, is that we

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,489
don't want the thing moving in X, we want
it to be frozen in X. So, click on your RollerBall

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:58,380
and then, come along to Constraints Freeze
Position in X, like that. Now, let's try it.

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,180
Play the game and use your Cursor Left and
Right Keys. Fantastic! Now, if you notice

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,599
if you hit the Space Key or whatever the currently
assigned jump key is, it goes far too high,

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,480
so lets turn the Jump Power down to say 2
or 1 even. Fantastic! So, you get the idea!

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,980
We have a RollerBall prefab, it does quite
a lot for us and it's kind of fun. I'm also

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,340
going to turn up my motion power or my Movement
Power to say 10, just so it's a little more

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,830
responsive, you could also make it lighter,
that could be another way. See it's got friction

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,730
and everything. Wicked isn't it! OK, I quite
like it! So, that's that! Now, you have of

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,989
course been making modifications to this instant
of a prefab, that came from the Character

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,330
Pack. I don't like that, let's tidy up our
organization here, and I'm not going to do

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,920
the standard boring thing of making scripts
folders and all the rest of it, because look

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,269
we can use this filter tool here. If I want
to see all my scripts, I can just click there,

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,709
and it will show me all the scripts across
all folder. So, I'm not going to duplicate

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,629
that in my folder structure, for this project.
I'm going to make a different folder structure,

00:03:53,629 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm going to have a Player Folder and put
the Player Script in it, for example. OK,

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,560
and then, we will see later on what we do,
but maybe Beams, maybe have a folder for Beams,

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,769
if we're going to call all these blue things
beams, and then the blue material goes in

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,830
there and the beam ought to be prefabbed.
Drag it down here to prefab it and pop it

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,600
in Beams. We also ought to be re-prefabbing
this RollberBall, so we've got our own prefab.

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,100
So, let's drag that down. There we go, RollerBall,
into Player, so that's now attached to a different

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,979
prefab; this guy here independent of the Standard
Asset Pack. We have the script in there, it's

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,260
all looking better. Do we want our Scenes
Folder? Well... one folder no, one scene no,

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,010
Editor yes, we need to leave that as it is,
it's a special reserved folder name. Standard

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,840
Assets I'm going to leave it as it is OK.
So, I'm just going to organize things a little

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,889
differently for this game. So, what I want
you to do now is just to explore all the control

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,370
options, in this thing. I want you to go into
the scripts, into say this Bool Script, and

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,690
take a look and see how much of it you understand
how much you don't understand, as to how the

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,060
bool script works. Also, have a look at the
Bool User Control Script in here, again see

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,470
what makes sense to you, what doesn't. OK,
and then, anything that you discover or any

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,380
questions that you've got, I want you to share
them in the discussions. So, basically tune

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,620
the RollerBall for your 2.5D game. Try out
all the controls, look at the scripts, see

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,790
if you can modify them to do something a little
different, and ask any questions you may have

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,229
in the discussions. So, I really want you
to stop now and use everything you've learned

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,530
in this section, so far to put together something
a little unique. I want you to start being

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,030
a bit more creative, about what this game
is going to look like. OK, fantastic! I'll

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,409
see you in a moment!
