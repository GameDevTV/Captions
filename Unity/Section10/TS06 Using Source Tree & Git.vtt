00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.220
Hey guys! So, in this video we're going to
download SourceTree, a nice visual front end

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.420
to Version Control. We'll be creating local
and remote repositories, using a .gitignore

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.110
file, so not everything is tracked. Connect
to GitHub or BitBucket, if you prefer, I'll

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.510
show you the differences, and share your repository
in the discussions. So, let's put all this

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.539
in context, I'll draw you a nice diagram,
as we go, but let's start off by talking about

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.500
just getting SourceTree and why we'd want
to use SourceTree. So, if you go to Google

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.100
and do a Google search, like this, for SourceTree,
then you will find www.sourcetreeapp.com is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.820
one place to get it. It's also part of Atlassian's
software suit, so you could go via there,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.250
you get the same thing, and SourceTree is the
visual front end. And then, you also have

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.920
a product by Atlassian called Bitbucket, which
is their equivalent of GitHub. So, if we go

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.579
to GitHub, then I could just go to the root
of GitHub. This is GitHub, although because

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.130
I'm logged in it doesn't quite look like the
front of GitHub, and then, this is SourceTree

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.610
and Bitbucket. So, SourceTree and Bitbucket
are under Atlassian's Eco System. GitHub and

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.280
actually GitHub Desktop is new and available
now, and it might be fine, it might do a very

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.230
similar thing, you see it's going to show
you pictures. So, you've got a couple of different

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.700
options, there's actually lots of different
options for version control. I use SourceTree

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.500
as a visual front end by these guys, but I
use it with GitHub, because GitHub is a little

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.320
bit more commonly known and I like this funky
graph, and basically I also find it works

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.540
a little bit better with GitHub. Let me just
show you what I perceive to be the pros and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.730
cons of these two remotes. So, locally it
doesn't matter, we're going to use a Git based

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:54.360
system. You could use GitHub on the Command
Line, you could use SourceTree, or you could

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.630
use GitHub's Desktop Tool, but in terms of
what we use as a remote repository you've

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.090
got the option of GitHub or Bitbucket and
others. GitHub is very well known and it's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.300
got great support on the web, whereas Bitbucket
is less well known. GitHub plays very well

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.870
with SourceTree, where strangely I found that
creating remote repositories with BitBucket,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.310
in a single step, doesn't work so well with
SourceTree, which is crazy when BitBucket

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.560
and SourceTree are both by the same company,
but the major difference that most people

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.530
consider is that GitHub is not free for private
repositories. If you don't want your source

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.530
code to be open, it's fine for the course
for it all to be open, but when you start

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.150
making commercial games, you may not want
open source. So, you've got to decide whether

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.060
you pay GitHub or whether you go to BitBucket
and get free private repositories. So, you

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.590
can use either GitHub or BitBucket. I'm going
to suggest that you do download SourceTree

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.120
through, as a visual front end. You don't
have to, it's entirely up to you, and again,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.560
you just search for SourceTree. Get that downloaded
and installed on your machine, pretty simple,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.170
and it's this program that you've seen me
using. OK, so once it's installed on your

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.850
machine, then what you have is, as I say,
this visual front end. Then, what you're going

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.590
to need to do is you firstly create your Unity
project, is the first thing you do, so you

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.830
make yourself a new Unity project. Now, think
about where you put this. I have a folder

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.910
called Repos, I have under my user I have
something called Repos, it's a fairly standard

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.290
name, and it's easy to access on the Command
Line, if you want to use that later. And then,

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.800
inside Repos, I'm just going to call it test.
We're going to have your Unity Folder, so

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.190
here we go. Now, how does Unity work? It's
going to create another folder inside BenTest

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.990
alright, so that's not where I want it. What
I want is something inside my Repos folder,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.290
so you tell Unity just to go to Repos, and
then, whatever I call it here, so TestProject,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.360
will be a new folder. That's how Unity works,
you've probably got that by this stage in

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.480
the course. So, let's go see what Unity has
created for us, under TestProject, here you

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.920
go. And then, you've got Assets, Library,
etc. Alright, so there's your project, so

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.050
you've created on your disk a Unity project.
I'm just going to represent it here as a box,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.349
that's just a folder, if you like on your
machine, so here it is, and it's got assets

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.669
and various other things in it as different
file names. OK. I'll just do that to make

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.910
it look like a folder. So, we've done that,
that's fine. Go ahead, do that yourself, make

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.000
your Unity project. The next thing you need
to do is open up SourceTree, and you're going

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.389
to make create a local repository. What's
that do? Well, let's do it first and I'll

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.130
show you. You browse to the place that you
just created, which was TestProject the folder,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.360
and you can give it a name, TestProject is
fine and it's of type .git. We're going to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.900
use .git not Mercurial, it's the type of version
control. We're also going to create a remote

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.240
repository. Now, when you do this, you will
probably not have any accounts where, and

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.240
you'll need to figure an account, i.e. put
your GitHub or Bitbucket user name and password

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.820
in. Now, if it doesn't come up on this screen,
at this point, you can Cancel out of it, you

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:06.020
can click on Remote here, in SourceTree, and
then, the little cog icon in settings,as i got there. Remote

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.610
cog icon settings. And then, you can say Add
Account and you can call it GitHub or Bitbucket,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.260
and then, you put your user name and password.
I've got both GitHub and Bitbucket selected.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.630
I'm actually going to make GitHub my default,
these days. Fantastic! So, let's run through

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.350
it again. You Create a Repository, and there's
already a folder, so you're not creating a

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.070
folder, you're just creating a repository.
You point it to the Unity Folder, you also

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.550
create remote, you may as well do that in
a single step and this works really well in

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.600
SourceTree. Create. Now, what's this actually
doing for us? Well, let's go take a look,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.810
before we go any farther with creating the
remote, let's see what's happened. It looks

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.949
like nothing has happened here, and it may
not have done yet. Actually, I'm taking a

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.580
risk showing you this now, let's take a look
at it though, with hidden files shown, so

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:57.310
I've got a shortcut here. Yeah, it's made
a .git folder, and if I go into .git, it's

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.550
a hidden folder, if I type straight. It's
a load of stuff in a .git folder, so that

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.389
is basically what creating a local repository
does. The folder must already exist, it's

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:16.190
Unity's folder, and what it does is by creating
a repo you're adding in a .git file, there,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.370
OK into the folder and it's hidden. So, that's
what you've done at this stage, and now we're

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.400
going to create a remote repository. Well,
I'm just going to put it straight into my

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.490
GitHub account. I'm going to call it Test
project, and it's Private no, because you

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.669
haven't paid for GitHub, so It can't be private.
Create. So, it's now created a remote repository

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:46.550
and linked them together, so if I go on to
TestProject here, and then, I go to Push then

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.590
it already has something called origin. By
default it calls this remote thing origin,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.479
that's fine. On the left here, you can leave
it as origin or you could call it GitHub,

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:55.880
I tend to leave it as origin, but if you're
working with multiple remotes, you could call

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.460
it GitHub. I mean I tend to leave it as origin,
but if you're working with multiple remotes,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.840
say for some reason you want to push to GitHub
and SourceTree, I wouldn't suggest you do

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.400
that but then, you could call one origin and
one GitHub. So, when you see weird stuff on

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.580
the web like, GitPushOrigin, it could be saying
GitPushGitHub but origin is just the default

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.199
remote name. OK, so what we've got at this
stage is SourceTree is tracking all of the

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:25.030
local files, so what it's doing is it's acting
as a database, and SourceTree is kind of standing

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.400
here looking, if you like, at what's going
on. So, here's just an eye to say that it's

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.930
looking at the contents of this folder and
storing everything that it sees about the

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.889
differences, into this hidden folder structure,
and there, s lot of files it's tracking. Now,

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:41.699
the ones we don't want it to track, are these
library files, because they're basically temporary

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:47.120
files. So, we're going to now a .gitignore.
Now, I've got a .gitignore that I just naturally

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.389
use here, and I've even got a shortcut for
it and I'll give it to you in the Assets.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:58.910
So, what you do is you put a .gitignore file
right here, right at the root of your Unity

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.370
Project Folder here, along with the .gitignore,
and your assets, and all the rest of them,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:11.680
i.e. in this folder here. It's already got
that .git folder. Remember now we're going

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:19.750
to put a .gitignore now. I've got a keyboard
shortcut, that I've forgotten [Laughs] Let's

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:26.250
try again. Now, what that's done for me is,
it's copied this .gitignore file in here,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.199
and then, it's reminded me to set visible
meta files in Unity. So, over in Unity for

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:37.669
Version Control to work properly you're better
going to Project Settings, Editor, and then,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:44.169
over here where it says Version Control, Visible
Meta Files. That means that certain files,

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.449
when you make changes, will be visible and
will be tracked by Source Control. You want

00:08:48.449 --> 00:08:59.860
that, so set Version Control in Project Settings,
Editor, Mode, Visible Meta Files, so set that,

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:08.899
and then, let me show you what's in this .gitignore.
It's got a bunch of instructions as to what

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:11.970
you are going to ignore, and it's going to
ignore the Temporary Folder, the Library Folder,

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:18.329
and a bunch of others. So, I will provide
it as a download to this lecture, and in the

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:22.410
section assets. I'll provide this .gitignore
file for you. Alright, and then all you need

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.470
to do is put it into the folder. Now, on a
Mac that can be a pain, because everything

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:31.740
is hidden, so there's a way that you can show
hidden files in Finder on the Mac, if you

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:37.360
want to do it that way, or you can get used
to using the Terminal. This is the command

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.360
you need, take a look at that. In Terminal
on the Mac, which you open just by going to

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.420
Terminal in Spotlight, you can put defaults
write com.apple.finder show hidden files equals

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:53.309
YES, and when you do that, you can then go
down to Finder, hold down the Alt Key, Right

00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:57.990
Click, and say Relaunch. Ah, on Windows it's
probably easier to show your hidden files,

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.110
and at this point, it's now showing you hidden
files, so you're seeing the .gitignore and

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:07.790
the .git folder, alright. So, that's what's
really going on, and those hidden things here

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.939
are corresponding to the red and the green
that I've shown you, in there. Alright, so

00:10:11.939 --> 00:10:16.679
we've got a database, it's watching what we're
doing. If we now go back to SourceTree and

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:22.179
we stage all these things, then we're saying
OK we're about to want to commit all of these

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:25.860
of these files, because there's a .gitignore
in there... I'm just trying to drag this bar.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.300
...it's no longer any of the Library Files.
The moment I add .gitignore the Library Files

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.759
get ignored. OK, and then, I'm going to call
it initial commit. It's good to start with

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:40.939
an empty project and then, an initial commit.
Alright, so do that. You've made your initial

00:10:40.939 --> 00:10:46.350
commit, and you have something to track now.
If we then were to go into Unity, for example,

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.059
and create ourselves a script... Now, I want
you to make a hidden message to your friends

00:10:49.059 --> 00:10:54.540
in the discussions, and I want you to just
say something fun in a script or in some UI

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.100
text or something, so that they have to go
and find it. OK, it's going to be a part of

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.999
the fun of this video. So, I'm just going
to open up a script in here, and I'm just

00:11:02.999 --> 00:11:11.989
going to say print ("You found the sausage");
And if they find that then they'll see sausage

00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:16.410
is the keyword. So, back in SourceTree, if
you've saved your script, watch what happens.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.550
I've committed changes, it goes Oh cool! I've
noticed the addition of something called MyScript

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.779
and the Meta File, because we made them visible,
and in MyScript you've added all this stuff.

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:34.019
Cool hey! So, you can stage those files or
Stage All, and then, you can Commit, like

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:39.220
this: Added script. Just say what you did,
and we won't worry about pushing for the moment.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:46.660
So, now we've got two changes. Now, you go
back here and I say print ("something changed");

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:51.879
OK, save the script, go back to SourceTree,
and look what it's doing. Bless it, when it's

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:57.160
ready. Come on SourceTree, you can do it!
There you go! [Laughs] And now I just stage

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.220
everything, look what it does. OK, it thinks
a bunch of stuff has changed now, because

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.829
I actually bothered to save my project. So,
here you go here's a lesson. You need to save,

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:11.189
before you do your commit, you need to save
your project and ideally your scene as well

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:15.809
and then, you're capturing everything. So,
Control S, and Save Project, now you're capturing

00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:22.839
everything, so I'll put it all into the commit
but crucially, MyScript. Something changed

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:31.049
or Added something. OK, now that we're saving
fully the Unity project, only these changes

00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:41.059
will come in. print ("added something else");
Save that, save the project, save the scene,

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:45.699
it's a good habit to get into, you'll see
me doing this as we go through the section.

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:48.999
Look at the changes, and again there's a load
of changes to a load of things, because I've

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:52.980
saved the Unity project, but the one we care
about is the change to MyScript, it added

00:12:52.980 --> 00:13:00.189
something else. Yep! OK fantastic! So, now
we have a little bit of history in here, which

00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:04.689
is great. So, once you've got this history
and you're getting it all in place and your

00:13:04.689 --> 00:13:10.299
Unity project, what I want you to do is I
want you to push this up to GitHub. So, we're

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:13.350
going to push the Master Branch, don't worry
about branches for now, in fact just use the

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.290
Master Branch. We're not even going to cover
branches in this whole course, it's another

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:22.319
course. We're just going to push Master to
Origin. You'll see that on the web a lot,

00:13:22.319 --> 00:13:27.679
which is another way of saying push Master
to GitHub, it's going to push. Now, you may

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:31.679
need to authenticate yourself to GitHub, and
once you've authenticated, I'm not going to

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:37.739
do that on the screen, then over on GitHub
you will have yourself a repository, which

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:42.459
you can then go and find and share the URL
of. So, if I go to GitHub Ben Tristem, it

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:46.609
would be something like this. Here is the
MarbleMaze, here would be your repository.

00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:51.799
I want you to grab that repo URL, Paste it
into the discussions, and challenge people

00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:56.470
to download your project, which they can do
with a .zip here, or they can take a clone

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:02.209
straight into SourceTree, but that's a bit
more advanced. And they can go and find your

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:05.059
hidden message for them. And then, you've
done it, you've setup SourceControl and you've

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:08.529
shared with people in the community. So, look
it's going to take you some time to go off

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:12.480
and explore. I'm not giving you a complete
hand holding with this, I want you to work

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.309
it out for yourself, to some extent but this
is the fundamentals of how we use SourceTree.

00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:20.589
So, try and get it working yourself. Don't
struggle too long! If you're struggling, just

00:14:20.589 --> 00:14:24.949
carry on, and do it without Source Control,
but I wanted to give you this choice and I

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:29.269
will show you how I use Source Control, as
we go through the section. So, I hope that's

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:33.939
been helpful to you. Do go off and struggle
and look and use stack overflow and work out

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:37.869
how to use SourceTree, with Unity yourself.
And remember to download my doc, get it from

00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:40.139
the Section Assets and from this video. OK
see you!
