00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys! So. you can't get rid of me that easily. I have

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
decided to do a little bit more in this section. because I want to teach you some

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
new things. So. somebody quite rightly pointed

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
out that there is no second stick in this game right now. so it's not really

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a Twin Stick game. So. this is what we're going to do in this

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
video. We're going to end up in a situation where we can not only

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
control the ball like this. but we can also

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
pan the camera around like so. and also vertically.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Alright. so that's what we're going to be doing. The way that we're going to do that

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is we are simply going to

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
read from the second and third... Sorry. the

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
third and the fourth joystick axis.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
import and explore a Selfie Stick Prefab I've

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
made for you guys in Blender. write some code to make the camera track

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the player. and then. write some code to make the right stick

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
orbit the camera around. actually do that movement.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And we'll make sure it all works. so let's dive in and

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
do that. So. let's get this done! I'm going to go through this quite

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
quickly. at least the bits that you've seen before. So. the Project Settings.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Input. At the moment. we don't have the

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
right stick setup. so you will be in a situation where

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you have 18 elements in your Axes Array.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and we need to take this up to 20. So. if you change that to 20.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you get room for a couple more. In my case. they both

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
come out as Cancel. but we're going to call them something different.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So. I'm going to describe the first one as right.

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
as in right stick.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Horiz. so as in the Right Stick Horizontal

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Axis. Now. I've got my game controller connected right now.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Remember that if it's not connected and paired by a Bluetooth. or

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
however you've got it connected when you start Unity. you won't be able to see it.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so just bear that in mind. Alright. so I don't need any buttons. so I'm going to hit

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the buttons away. and for gravity and dead zones. I'm going to refer

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
back to see what the other sticks

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
have had. So. these horizontal and vertical axis

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
historically have had a Gravity of 3. a Dead

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Zone of 0.01. Let's just make sure quickly that's working OK.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So. that feels OK. so I'm going

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to go with that 3.001 and 3 for

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Gravity. Dead Zone. and Sensitivity. So. let's just do

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that down for this new axis.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Fantastic! Now. it's a keyboard or mouse. you may as well just change it

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to Joystick. because it's going to be a Joystick Axis.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now. which axis is it? Well. it's going to be the third axis.

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
probably for the righr horizontal. Now. if we're not sure. we're going to just test it

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
by writing to the log. so I'm going to assume it's the third

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
axis. for the moment. And I'm just going to now write a

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
scritp. that's going to try and verify this. So. I'm going to make a new folder

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
called Camera. because in this project. we're orgnizing

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
things by game entity. And I'm going to make a

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
script that is attached to

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the camera for now. and I'm just going to call it

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
CameraPan.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
OK. you can Create and Add that script. Now. what

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I want to do. I just need any script in a folder and

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
attached to the GameObject. that I can use to log to the

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Console. So. against the camera. we now have this

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
CameraPan Script. Let's take a look and see if we can work out which axis

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
we're talking about. So.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we're actually going to use a different method later. LateUpdate. but for now. I just want

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to get printing and make sure that I've found the right axis.

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So. print and I'm just going to say right horiz

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to remind myself of what I'm printing. Input

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
dot oops GetAxis. Now. I'm going to challenge you in a moment.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to do this yourself. and I'm going to use the name

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that I put in. which is RHoriz.

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
for Right Horizontal Stick. And let's just

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
see if that logs out properly. saving the scripts.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Let me close the Solution. Back into Unity.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
let's play. Now first. before you just make sure the left

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
stick works. i.e. that you're connect to your thing. to your

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
gamepad. and then now. look at the Console. Right Horiz. now that's

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
-1. 0. +1. Good! So. our Horiz

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
works. That is fantastic news! That is progress!

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So. here's a pretty simple challenge for you. I think you can guess what this one

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
is going to be. Just add the vertical axis now; get the vertical axis

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
logging to the Console. So. go ahead. pause the video. sort

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the vertical axis out for yourself. to make sure you've understood what I've done.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Cool! Welcome back! So. I think that getting this vertical

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
axis working is pretty simple right. I'm going to do a cut and paste

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
of the horizontal axis. I'm going to call it

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
RVert.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And same here. and then. over

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in the Input Manager of Unity.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Edit Project Settings. Input.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
we're going to go down. and under our Horiz we're

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
just going to change the next one to RVert.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And then. go for the same settings 3 Gravity.

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Dead Zone. and Sensitivity. same as the one above.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Just so that it's a Joystick Axis. we don't need a mouse

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
button or button in this case. and let's just test. So.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
left and right gives RHoriz figures. and then. up and down

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
isn't giving any RVert figures.

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So. if that's the case for you. a few things

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to check. Check your script is saved.

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
which it does appear to be. Make sure that you've spelled it all right.

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
RVert. it's worth copying and pasting that

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
into here. Check the

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
settings against the Horizontal Axis and make sure they're basically

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
exactly the same. and this is the problem. it is the

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
axis. Instead of the X Axis. I want the Fourth Axis.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
OK. so Third Axis for X. Fourth Axis for

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Y. If we save that and try.

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
now we have Vertical. working fine

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and Horizontal working fine. Good! Fantastic!

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We can delete these log entries. because we don't need them anymore!

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And that part of the challenge is sorted. That's great!

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Now. next challenge I want you to do is. I want you to make the camera point

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
at the player. So. find the player by tag

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in script. Make the camera look at the player. every frame.

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
we can do this in the same CameraPan Script for now.

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And then. consider using the LateUpdate() method. rather than the Update

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
method. This does things a little bit later. so that if the player has moved

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
during the frame. then the camera doesn't point at it until the

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
end of the frame. you just get a smoother result. So. pause the video. see

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
if you can get the camera tracking the play now. for the first time.

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
OK!

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Welcome back! So. this is what we're going to do to make the camera

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
tracking work. It's pretty simple. the camera

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
tracking. it doesn't take a huge amount of code to get

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that working.

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So what we're going to do is. we're just going to have ourselves a private

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
GameObject. We're going to find this in script. and I'm just going

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to call it player. Then. at the Start. we're going to go find that

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
player by tag. so it's simply player =

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
GameObject.find object

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
with tag. object single object

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
with tag. and it's going to be my name ("Player");. Now. at this stage

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I would want to be going to Unity. checking that my player

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
indeed is tagged with player. which we did earlier in the project. There it is

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and then. coming back. Fantastic! Now.

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I'm going to use LateUpdate. not Update. I'm going to

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
delete the comment. because it's no longer quite the same thing.

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And I'm going to use transform.LookAt. a very useful

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
method. which we'll use again later. Now. you're welcome to look at Unity's

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
docs for that. and we're going to look at the player's transform.

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
OK. so

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
constantly look at the transform. Let's see what effect that has!

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
As I move the left stick now. you see the camera just

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
keeps the ball right in the middle. Let's just over the block! Wee!

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
That's pretty cool! So now. we've got the camera tracking.

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The final thing we want it to do. is for the right hand stick

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
to pan up and down.

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
OK. so let's take a look at how we're going to do that. I've given you a Start Pack.

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
which you may or may have not unzipped by this stage.

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So. in that Start Pack you have got

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
a couple of things. Let's go get the Start Pack and

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
download it and unzip it. So.

149
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
here we go. your Section Assets

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Start Pack. And it's got a few things in it. let's just

151
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
put all of those into say the Camera Folder.

152
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
because they're all going to be related to the camera. Now. I've given you this selfie

153
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
stick thing. both as a .blend file and a .fbx. If you haven't

154
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
got Blender installed. you can use the .fbx. Let's take a look at what

155
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
it is. I'll use the Blender one. It's an arm. literally like

156
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
a selfie stick you use to take photos. and an

157
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
empty. just to make sure all the rotations and axes work properly.

158
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Alright. so what we're going to do with this

159
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
guy is we're going to use. quite literally. a selefie

160
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
stick attached to the

161
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
ball. So. I'm going to drag the selfie stick into the scene.

162
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
like that. And you see. there it is just sitting attached. especially if I

163
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
look in Scene View. It's just kind of sitting over where the ball is. If we play

164
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and go back to Scene View. it will just move.

165
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The ball will move but the selfie stick won't.

166
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It's just a thing. it's literally just a mesh

167
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that's the shape of a cylinder. with some round ends on it. sitting in the world.

168
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
but crucially this thing has its axis at the

169
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
very bottom. which is why I made it in Blender. rather than just using a cylinder.

170
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Now. look what happens when we rotate it. If we rotate in X. it rotates

171
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
around the bottom. If we rotate in Z. it rotates

172
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
around the bottom. You'll see why that's useful in a minute.

173
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
OK. So. the first thing I want you to do in code. with this selfie

174
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
stick. is just to get it to lock itself to the

175
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
ball's position. So. we need the selfie stick

176
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
literally locking to the ball's position. so

177
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I'm going to create a script called Camera Arm.

178
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
for instance or SelfieStick. is easier.

179
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
SelfieStick. there we go! So. there's my SelfieStick

180
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
script. I'm going to go tidy it away into the Camera Folder.

181
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
because it's all related to the camera.

182
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And what I want you to do is just. move the selfie stick.

183
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
every frame. to the position of the player.

184
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Very similar to what we just did by the LookAt. so go ahead and make the selfie

185
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
stick move to the position of the player. every frame.

186
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Your not even getting a challenge slide this time. you're just going to have to do it.

187
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
OK. so I'm going to go ahead and start making that work now.

188
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So. I'm going to have myself a private GameObject

189
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
player; I'm going to

190
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
find it in script again. because this is something you don't want your designer doing. because if

191
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
it's not done. the whole code breaks right. So. this is something

192
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that's not negotiable. We're going to go and find it in

193
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
code. Find object with tag player again. same as before.

194
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
OK that's fine!

195
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We literally. in the LateUpdate again. because this is...

196
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Well. actually here no. we're not rendering. I'm going to leave it in

197
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Update. OK. we're moving something here. we're not rendering a

198
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
result of the movement. that's when you choose between Update and LateUpdate. When you're moving

199
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
things. use Update. When you're rendering the result of movement. use Late

200
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Update. So then. we're just going to say the transform.position

201
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
of this very thing. of this selfie stick. is the player's

202
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
transform.position. Let's see

203
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
how that works. and if it does work. I'll show you

204
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
the code again. because I know I did that very fast. There you go. selfie

205
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
stick is stuck in the middle of the ball. Now. you might say. why

206
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
don't you just child the selfie stick to the ball? Good luck. Go ahead.

207
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Have a go. You'll see what happens. if you do that is this. watch.

208
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Of course. the ball rotates. so the selfie stick rotates.

209
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Not good! Alright. that's why I've done it in script.

210
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So. we are actually very

211
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
nearly there now aren't we. We've got nearly everything we want. What we

212
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
need to do now is make this orbit properly. so

213
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I'm going to get you setup. for the mouse orbiting

214
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
on the right stick. and then. once I've got you set up. I'm going to get you to

215
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
do the final bit of this. alright. So. I'm going to have myself

216
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
a public float PanSpeed.

217
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and that's going to be

218
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
= to 10. as a default. I don't know. that's just a guess as to

219
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
something that's the right speed.

220
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
OK. and another thing we're going to need is a private

221
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Vector3. to represent the armRotation.

222
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Now. let me must show you. in Unity. what I mean by that.

223
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Here is the selfie stick. and we're literally talking about

224
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
this Vector3 here. We want to bring the arm down.

225
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
we want to bring the arm around. and then. we're going to put the camera

226
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
on the end of the arm. Yeah. that's the idea of this

227
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
whole scheme. is that we put the child. the camera. to the end of

228
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
this arm. literally like a selfie stick. So. we're going to need an

229
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
arm rotation vector. right. Now. we want the designer

230
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to be able to set up what this arm rotation is. so in the Start

231
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
we go and find the arm rotation. from the transform

232
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
.rotation. of the thing we're on. What are

233
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
we on? We're on the selfie stick OK. But if

234
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
you just do that what are you going to get? What data type do you get out of transform

235
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
.rotation? Well. you get a Quaternion.

236
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We want to be dealing with eulerAngles here. so luckily we have a method

237
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
.eulerAngles; that's actually a property. in this case.

238
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
because there are no brackets. so property of the rotation is eulerAngles.

239
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So. this thing is simply this Vector3 here of the stick

240
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
OK. Fantastic! I'm

241
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
over using that word! I know. you can tell me off in the discussions. So.

242
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
let's get half of this done. and you're going to do the last bit.

243
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
What I'm going to do is build up a Vector3. that says armRotation.

244
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Y. How do I know it's Y? Well.

245
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
let's play with it. Is it this guy here?

246
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Probably. if the rotation is working? There you go!

247
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
That's your horizontal movement. around there. OK.

248
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So. armRotaton.Y +=

249
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
so we're adding Input dot

250
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
get axis

251
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
("R... Now. what was it called. let's look over here.

252
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And I've forgotten. so we need to go to the Input Manager.

253
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I think it was RHoriz and RVert.

254
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
but we should check and copy and paste. RHoriz and RVert. there you

255
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
go in the Input Manager.

256
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So. we're going to take.

257
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
not Input.GetKey but Input.GetAxis.

258
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
with this

259
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
string ("RHoriz") times

260
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that panSpeed that we set up. Now. I don't know that's the right panSpeed.

261
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
but let's try now and find out. So. every frame we just

262
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
add whatever the right stick is to the rotation.

263
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Let's try it. So it starts at a reasonable place.

264
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Play! Now. the camera is not childed to it yet but we don't mind.

265
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Go out to the Scene View. perhaps. and move the right stick and

266
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
see if we get what we want.

267
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Get the ball moving. but the right stick isn't

268
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
doing what we want. so let's check the panSpeed.

269
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
The panSpeed is sensible. and let's go

270
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
back here and break this problem down. Why are we not getting

271
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
anything? Well. the simple reason we're not getting anything is because

272
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
we haven't told the transform.rotation

273
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
to change. Now. we need it to be

274
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
the arm rotation. We want the rotation

275
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
of the selfie stick to become the arm rotation.

276
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
but unfortunately. again we've got to give this a

277
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Quaternion. So. there is a static method on Quaternion

278
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
called euler.

279
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And you can give that a Vector3 and it'll spit back

280
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
a Quaternion. OK. so this is going to and from a Quaternion.

281
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So. let's try this. We're going to look in

282
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Scene View. so we can see what's happening.

283
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Ah. see the right stick is doing that. Awesome!

284
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Everything is awesome! So. we are nearly nearly

285
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
there. Guess what I'm going to challenge you to do now? Of course. it's

286
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
make the vertical pan work. Right stick vertical movement should

287
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
work. Camera will move up and down. at the same distance.

288
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
or at least the stick will move. we'll put the camera on the end.

289
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
at the very end. And see if you can do it in one line of code.

290
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
It's basically repeating what I've just done but for the vertical axis.

291
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Go ahead! Have a go!

292
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Cool! Welcome back! So. I'm going to try and do this in a simple cut and paste

293
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
operation. So. it's literally saying that the arm

294
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
rotation in... Now. we need to think about whether it's in X or Z.

295
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Let's go over into Unity and see.

296
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
There. looks like X. so the

297
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
X component will track the RVert

298
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
axis. Confident in that? Maybe? Don't

299
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
know. try it! Don't worry about it too much just. go pop over.

300
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
give it a go! This is lean and simple. There you go!

301
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I've got a little bit of drift going on. which means I haven't got enough

302
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Dead Zone. So. if you're getting that drift. that means there's not enough

303
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Dead Zone on the controller. So. you go to Input. and

304
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
for both I think. actually. I'm going to give a little bit more Dead Zone. I'm going to

305
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
move that down. to say 0.01. That's a

306
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
10 fold increase in the Dead Zone on the stick.

307
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and you may

308
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
need to even further. I'm going to make a Dead

309
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Zone of 1. I know it's a 100 times bigger Dead Zone. but

310
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
still I think that's going to be too much and it won't move at all. No. it's OK!

311
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Feels about right on my stick. Obviously. you can see how much my stick

312
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
is moving but that's fine. All we need to do to make this work now guys

313
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
is to take the camera and stick it on the end of the selfie

314
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
stick. And you just need to make sure it is actually on the end

315
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
of the selfie stick. So. at 0. 0.

316
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
0 has almost done it. but the selfie stick is 10 units long. So.

317
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
there it is look! Let me maximize this. so you can see what's going on.

318
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
The camera is on the end of the selfie

319
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
stick. and then. when we rotate...

320
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
When we move the ball you see. there it goes. Now. of course. you

321
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
can delete the mesh of this selfie stick but I'm just going to leave it in.

322
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
If I jump it works. but if I use the right stick.

323
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
now horizontally I move around. You see the camera

324
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
preview down at the bottom there. and you see what's happening. It's too

325
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
fast. by the way. so if it's too fast you know what to do.

326
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Let's un-maximize. come

327
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
down to the selfie stick's publicly exposed property. turn it down

328
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
to maybe 2. and let's have a look in the Game View.

329
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
There you go. you see that!

330
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And the ball can be moving and we can move around. Now we have

331
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
proper twin stick control. All I'm going to do

332
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
to tidy this up is to go and find the Arms. Mesh Renderer.

333
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and turn it off. so that the Arm is now invisible

334
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and doesn't cast any weird shadows. Cool guys. congratulations!

335
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
That really is the end of this section! Now. you have a genuine Twin Stick game!

336
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Go and include these mechanics in a game of your own. and I'll see you

337
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.833
on the other side!
