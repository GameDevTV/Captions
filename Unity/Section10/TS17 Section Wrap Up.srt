
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, I am both very sad

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but also super excited, as you can see from this smile!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is the last section you're going to see from me in this course.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The next section is going to be from Brice, Ahoy Matey,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a real-time strategy game. And I

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
just want to say, well done getting this far!

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, I know this particular game hasn't even been

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
a game, it's been a sandbox. Now, my intention is to be weaning

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you off me holding your hand, every

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
single step of the way. Now, the reason I'm so excited is

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because it's not by any means the end of the journey for you

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or for me. In fact, I'm about to dive into the production of

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
a course on the Unreal Engine and also to help

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Michael finish off the Blender Course and it's so much

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
more to do. So, anyway 2.5D games,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think you have all the tools that you need now. It's really

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
up to you to go and use your tenacity and your

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
inventiveness, to go out there and apply your

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
idea for your 2.5D game, using everything

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
you can find in the course so far, and in any future content

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and really go out there and consider making a 2.5D

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
game, because they can be a huge amount of fun. So, I hope

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you've enjoyed the course to this stage, and I will see you soon!
