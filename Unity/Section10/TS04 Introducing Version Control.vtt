Hey guys! So, in this video we're going to
talk about why you may want to use Version

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.250
Control. I'm going to give you an overview
of how we use it, ask you to follow us on

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.949
GitHub, where to find the course repositories,
and what's different about how you may use

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.420
it. So, what is it? What is this Version Control
Log? Well, let's take a little look around.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.269
Let's start off by going to say GitHub's website.
GitHub is just one of many different version

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.850
control systems, so here is me on GitHub,
and this is telling you all of the different

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.010
projects I've contributed to and this little
chart that tells you the density of contributions

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.809
by day, so it's like a heat map, which is
pretty cool! Alright, so what is the point

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.059
of Version Control and how do we use it? Well,
maybe we start with SourceTree, which is the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.360
program that we use for Version Control. Well,
I'm going to open up, let's say, Zombie Runner.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.469
Now, it's a bit of a face full you're going
to get here, but let me talk you through bit

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.430
by bit. OK, so if we start here with what
we call the Master Branch, and we can ignore

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.170
this stuff on the left, you can basically
ignore the stuff on the bottom for now. I

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.650
started off with a pretty much empty Unity
project here, and then, what happened is I

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.700
added in a video that just had very little
in it, and then, I created a terrain, we brought

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.540
in all this stuff, terrain assets, etc. and
it goes on. So, every single video I created

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.799
for that last section I committed those changes
to a GitHub snapshot. So, these are like backups,

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.520
but named backups, if you like, rather than
timed backups, which you would have with something

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.490
like Time Machine. You specifically take a
snapshot at a obvious point of change, either

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.549
something is going to change or you've had
some success or whatever, you'll get a feel

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.180
for when to commit to take these snapshots.
So, I just use the word commit. What does

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.630
that mean? Let's start to build the terminology
for Version Control. Here are some things

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.380
you'll hear me use. You'll hear me talk about
a Repo, it's short for repository. It's the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.610
code for a whole project, so Zombie Runner,
for example, is a Repo. If you were to then

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.220
look over here into the Complete Unity Developer
organization... You don't need to do anything,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.910
just listen to me. I'm going to be giving
you all these links and everything shortly.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.060
You'll see that each section fits nicely,
and in our case into a repository. It's a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.690
project in it's own right, it's a game in
it's own right, so basically one Repo, repository,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.319
per game. Committing! What is Committing?
It's basically saving a local snapshot of

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.750
your project. So, that's where I've come along
and made some changes, like these changes

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.640
that are hanging on the end here, and like
I've written the word nasty into this text

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.209
file, for example, and those changes are just
waiting to be committed, i.e. to take a snapshot

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.410
into my local database. Now, you can do all
of this without any connection to the Internet.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.000
You can take these wonderful snapshots and
safely roll your project back and go ah, I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.060
wish I would have not gone down that path.
I wish I would have maybe done something different,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.310
at this point. Well, you could Checkout, which
is the next term. At the bottom there it says

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.920
Checkout, which is where you load a local
snapshot of your project, so committing is

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.370
saving a snapshot of your project effectively.
And checking out is loading a snapshot, and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.080
then, you've got the idea of pushing and pulling,
which is sending and receiving your whole

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.440
repository to a remote database. So, this
is a view of my local stuff, and then, where

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.030
we go over here to Zombie Runner, this is
the public version of the same thing and all

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.700
those same commits are here. And that's because
I pushed them to the Internet. OK, so you

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.099
can get more of a handle on this by just saying
maybe git. push, pull, commit, or something

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.069
into Google Images, and you'll get loads of
images. Some of them are more complex than

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.860
you need, some of them are probably simpler
than you need. Here is one example that is

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.250
reasonably good, you have your Local File
System, Your Local Work-Space on the right,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.500
you add things, as you go, to an Index. Well,
I don't intend to spend a lot of time doing

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.909
that; if I'm making changes what I do at the
very end is I stage them like this, all of

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.010
them in one go. I'm basically saying, we want
to track every single file. Every change I've

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.659
made in this last working session, I want
to track it, so that's the adding. You then,

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.360
Commit as I've just talked about. If you want
to go back you Checkout, so that's like loading.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.560
If you Push that's going to Remote, if you
fetch your Clone, that brings the remote back

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.919
to your local, and Pulling does something
different again. OK, so that's one example,

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.830
there are lots of other images you can look
at. I just want to give you an overview, at

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.540
this stage, that's the only purpose is just
to give you an overview of how this all works.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.590
Alright, so there are the terms, if you need
them, refer back to this slide. So, your challenge

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.380
now is pretty simple. Sign up for GitHub,
if you haven't already, that's at GitHub.com,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.210
and you will be a proper developer once you've
done that. Visit this link, which I've just

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.610
showed you, we'll go there in a second. Take
a look around the site, click through to me

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.930
and Brice, and then, follow us if you want
future updates. So, you come here, which is

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.740
the Complete Unity Developer link I just gave
you, to that link there. You'll see something

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.380
like this, and then, you can click through
to me or Brice and you just come down, and

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.699
if you're anonymous or public or it's your
account, see I'm logged in as me, so it doesn't

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.900
give me quite the same option, then you'll
have follow up at the top right here. And

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.850
if you click that, then you'll get some future
updates from me, you can control notifications,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.210
etc. And that will give you some feeling of
how this system works, and once you've done

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.199
that, then we will talk about how you're going
to actually download our project state, as

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.949
another test of GitHub. So, pause the video,
go ahead, get yourself a GitHub account if

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.080
you haven't got one. Find that Repo at GitHub
forward slash Complete Unity Developer, take

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:41.410
a look around, and follow either Brice or
Me or both. Cool! Cool! Welcome back! So,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.600
that's good! Hopefully you just literally
went to the URL we gave you, as an anonymous

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.150
browser like this, as an anonymous user you
signed up for GitHub, and then, once you signed

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.350
up for GitHub you would see it looking something
like this, if you're on the Complete Unity

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.270
Developer. And you may have noticed all these
different sections, and these are all the

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.100
sections of the course of course. So, spend
a few minutes taking a look around GitHub,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.389
take a look at our different projects, the
different states of the projects, and in the

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:12.139
next video, I'm going to show you how you
can download our project state, at any particular

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:17.860
point in time, once you're inside it, but
also how we use GitHub rather, so that you

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.889
understand that. And then, we'll go on to
talk about how you are going to use it to

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.280
control your and manage your versions, in
your development, because if you're going

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.419
to be building anything serious, now I think
it's definitely worth you taking snapshots.

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.930
If nothing else as a backup, so that you can
go back in time if you want to. So, take a

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.470
look around, have a look at things like the
Branch Setting and the Commits here. I'll

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.759
show you how to use it all in a bit.
