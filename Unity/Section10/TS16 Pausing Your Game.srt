00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,340
Hey welcome back! So, finally for this section
I want to show you how to pause your game,

00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,830
t's been a common request. So, I'm going to
show you one way of pausing your game in Unity.

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:17,200
We'll look at OnApplicationPause message and
understand Time.timeScale better. Cool! So,

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,880
here we are in the game. We want to pause
the game, so let's look at a few of Unity's

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,470
methods that may help with this. When it's
Time.timeScale, which you've used before,

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,300
and you can use it to slow down the game,
but you can also use it to stop the running

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,559
of the game altogether, by saying Time.timeScale
= 0. It also says here, that you better lower

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,449
your Time.fixed.DeltaTime by the same amount
so, if you're pausing, you want to set Time.timeScale

00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:51,620
to 0 and Time.fixed.DeltaTime to the same
amount, like 0, in this case. So, I will show

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,809
you that practically in just a moment. We
also need to understand does the Unity execution

00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:01,979
still work? I did the fixed update loops still
and the update loops still run, when Time.deltaTime

00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,350
is set to 0. Well, let's find out shall we.
Let's go into the Game Manager and just do

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,540
a little experiment. This is the sort of thing
I would encourage you to do. So, we can some

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:20,480
along here and we can say on Update, we can
do another look for if (Input.GetButtonDown

00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,830
and then (KeyCode.p for pause, let's say.
OK, or we could actually use whatever has

00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,390
been assigned to pause, but be careful with
this one, this guy here is the Pause Button

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,200
on PC machines. So, I'm just going to use
the P key, directly, but of course what you

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,190
would normally do is actually assign this
to a re-mappable button if it's that type

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,830
of game but for now, let's just use the P
key. Here we go. So, if we go for P, then

00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,560
we want to pause the game, so I'm actually
going to write a method to make it clear,

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,820
all the things we're going to do when we pause.
So, void PauseGame () OK, and we'll just call

00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,479
PauseGame. So, what are we going to do in
PauseGame? Well, let's try this, Time.timeScale

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:11,689
= 0; OK, so let's try setting Time.timeScale
= 0, and while we're at it, every single update,

00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:20,790
let's just print ("update"): And of course,
my challenge is, I'm saying GetButtonDown,

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:29,159
when I meant GetKeyDown. OK, let's have a
look. So, we play the game, we observe the

00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,180
Console, we get lots and lots of updates coming
out here, we hit P... What happens? You have

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,599
to be in the Game Window, of course. Do the
updates keep coming out and does the thing

00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,889
move? So, let's take a look, more carefully.
I'm going to collapse the Console, clear it,

00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:51,230
play, move left and right, hit P... That's
frozen there, but it's still running the Update

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,109
Loop. So, to be clear, the Update Loop still
runs, when you go into Pause Mode, but the

00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:01,430
timescale is set to 0, so all of these frame
updates and physics updates will be set to

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,159
0. OK, so you'll not have any movement going
on, but the Update Loop is still being called.

00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:13,319
So, that's one clarification for you. So,
we have set Time.timeScale = 0. We better

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,180
show a way of resuming the game, so let's
just do a very similar thing, and let's just

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,879
say if (Input.GetKey... Actually, you do this.
Pause the video and sort it out, so that if

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,659
you push P again, or if you push R, either
way.. either separately you push R for resume

00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:32,889
or if you Push P again, the game resumes.
OK, go ahead and pause the video, as a mini

00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:39,769
challenge, and arrange to come out of Pause
Mode now. Common, do it! [Laughs] I mean,

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:43,079
I'm going to show you how, but I'm just going
to give you an opportunity to do it for yourself.

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,329
OK, I'm going to do it the easy way, which
is GetKeyDown, and then, I'm just going to

00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,919
use a different key, otherwise we could just
use a Boolean to store the state. (KeyCode.R))

00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,919
And then, just pop in a new method, which
I'm going to say ResumeGame. The purpose of

00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,249
this, really is to show you what needs to
be done to pause and resume the game right.

00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:06,730
So, resume the game doesn't exist, because
we haven't written it yet. So, here it comes,

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,510
and then, we're just going to kind of undo
what we've done. And Time.timeScale = 1 float.

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,130
OK, so let's just check pausing and resuming
now. So, I'm playing away, left and right,

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,040
I hit P, the game stops moving, the Update
Loop is still running, although we've moved

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,370
the log entry. We hit R and the game continues.
Perfect! OK, now is that enough? Remember

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,890
back in that entry, here, it said... I'll
come to that in a minute. It said we should

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:40,760
also lower Time.fixedDeltaTime by the same
amount. So, how do you do that? What is Time.fixedDeltaTime,

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,200
and how are we going to change it? OK, it's
"the interval in seconds at which the physics

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:54,530
and other fixed frame rate, i.e., things in
the Fixed Update Loop are performed. So, what

00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:06,330
happens if we set fixedDeltaTime to 0? Let's
try that, and see whether it likes that, because

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,650
strictly speaking we're not setting the fixedDeltaTime
to 0, we're setting it to infinitely long,

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,900
but I think it will interpret this 0 appropriately.
There it goes, still running fine, and then,

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,700
the fixedDeltaTime is now 0, as well, which
makes sure that all the physics loops are

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,610
not being called as well. So, we have what
we need. Of course, in the resume of the game,

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,700
we need to undo the Time.fixedDealTime = 0.
We'd better set it back to what? Now, that's

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,930
a good question. That depends on what it was
set to in the Project Settings, in the first

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:42,410
case. Under Project Settings and Time, you
have Fixed Timestep equals 0.02. So, what

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,930
you'd better do is save that at the very beginning
of the game, so we'll have a private bool

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:58,820
fixedDeltaTime; OK, not a bool, well done
if you've noticed that. It's a float. And

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:06,190
then, on Start we'd better go and save it
the fixedDeltaTime = Time.fixedDeltaTime;

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:14,250
I'm also briefly going to print that, and
just confirm that it's 0.02, as we expect.

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,590
I'll comment out this line, and then, we'll
make on the resume, we'll make it go to whatever

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,080
it found it to be at the Start. OK, 0.02,
that verifies it's the same as the project

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,110
setting there. So, what we need to do, at
the end, is not set Time.fixedDeltaTime, i.e.

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,140
the rate at which fixed update loops are called
to some arbitrary value, but we're going to

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,390
set it to the fixedDeltaTime that we found
initially. OK, which is this guy here. And

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:50,640
if you don't like that name fixedDeltaTime,
I'll refactor it, initialFixedDelta; OK fantastic!

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,920
So, let's just make sure all that works, and
then, I'm going to tell you one more thing

00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,820
about pausing and we are done, for this section,
in fact, for my involvement in this course,

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,190
because Brice is doing the next section. So,
we Pause and it pauses and we Resume and it

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,300
resumes. Fantastic! That will all work nicely.
There is one other thing to tell you. There

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:12,150
is a documentation here about OnApplicationPause.
Now, this is a message that will get called

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:17,270
on all of your scripts, when the operating
system pauses your game. So, for example,

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,900
if somebody leaves your game in iOS, this
will get called. OK, these are not something

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,710
you can call and pause your game, and you
will have to decide how to handle this. So,

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,440
you might want to call another message inside
your game, you might want to set a Boolean

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,600
flag in your Game Manager, that sets pausing,
for example. That would be a good one, so

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,930
let me just show you that, as a final thing
here. So, imagine I didn't use KeyCode.P and

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,850
R, imagine I actually had a Boolean flag,
right. So, just go private isPaused = false;

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:57,900
So, the game starts not paused, and then,
if I say if KeyCodeDown and P, so if KeyCodeDown

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:10,870
pause is paused... I need to give this guy
a type. OK. So, if you put the KeyCode down

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:22,360
and it's paused, then, you ResumeGame (); and
then, there's an else if in here. If you push

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,920
the (KeyCode.P)... and I could possibly avoid
repeating this code here, but who cares...

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:36,890
and if it's not paused, then you pause the
game. So, all I've done there is done it the

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,360
other way, the challenge the other way, which
is we're just using a P key and a Boolean

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:49,080
flag now, so we can go left and right, we
can hit P, we can undo P; I hope, unless I've

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:57,590
done something silly, which I have. What's
the problem? So, if we get key code P and

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,980
it's paused, we resume. If it's not paused.
Ah OK, so of course, what I'm not doing is

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:10,210
setting this, so isPaused = so if it was paused
then, we're going to set it as false, and

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,960
if it wasn't paused we're going to set it
to true. So, we're just keeping track of this

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,330
Boolean, and this will allow us... In a minute
I'll show you what this is coming to, it's

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,050
coming to this OnApplication thingy here,
so hit P. Hit P again, that all works beautifully.

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,180
Now, what we can do, when we've got a structure
like this is we can intercept this message

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:35,230
that we've just found, this OnApplicationPause.
OK, and if I just do that, I can just say

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:43,920
isPaused = pauseStatus; that gets passed into
this message. So, now if the system pauses

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,870
this game, i.e. if the iOS, Android App close,
etc., it will just put this game into pause

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,250
status, over here. But this is not quite finished,
of course, because if you look at the logic,

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:02,440
this is responding to a key press and calling
ResumeGame (); and PauseGame (); whereas this

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,180
guy here, if we just set the Boolean, it's
not actually going to call pause or resume

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,640
game, if that makes sense. So, what you would
need to do is just take this out. You would

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:22,370
just need to say if (ResumeGame) then, we
need to... Well, you need to look at whether

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,839
or not the PauseGame and the ResumeGame have
changed state in the last frame, but look

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,440
that's simple, it's simple coding, well below
this point in the course, and I'm going to

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,900
leave that as an exercise to the reader. I
think I've covered everything I need to about

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,890
pausing for now. You are good to go, with
a little tiny bit of extra work, which I really

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,560
want you to do, because again, I'm weaning
you off me. OK guys, I'll see you later! [Laughs]
