Hey! Hey! Using an analog game-pad. brackets
optional! So. in this video. we'll be talking

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.070
about using game-pad input. setting up a PS4
controller on a Mac. Yeah! Yeah! I'm a Mac

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.559
guy. I'm sorry. Using an Xbox controller on
a PC. I'm not going to be showing you that.

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.339
but I believe it's incredibly simple on a
PC. to get an Xbox controller working. and

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.659
in case you haven't got a game-pad. we'll
talk a little bit more about the Gravity setting.

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.720
so that you can simulate having a game-pad.
They're pretty cheap. but in different countries

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.590
then. you know maybe it's not cheap to spend
10 to 15 dollars on a game-pad.. I appreciate

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.920
that. so you don't have to have a game-pad.
to take this section. because we won't be

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.440
deploying to Console. so you're not kind of
forced to have a game-pad. by any means. You

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.079
can always use a keyboard! So. let's just
take a look. How do you get this working?

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.160
Firstly. the game-pad needs to be working
at a system level. so on a Mac. that basically

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.179
means. with example. a PS4 game-pad that you
go to Bluetooth. you pair your wireless controller

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.949
with it. Now. how do you get a PS4 controller
into Pairing Mode? You hold down the PlayStation

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.530
Button and the Share Button. until it goes
into Pairing Mode. You pair it by Bluetooth.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.250
and actually it'll just work. pretty much.
So. once it's connected and it's confirmed

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.370
as connected here and you're light is on.
on your controller. then it should just work.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.800
Now. if it doesn't work. like this. nothing
coming out in my Console. then you just need

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.270
to quite Unity and reopen it. because actually.
Unity will typically not notice that you have

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.820
a controller installed. unless it was there
when Unity opened. So. I'm just reopening

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.210
Unity now. and then. if I play the game. make
sure you're clicked into the Game Window.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.040
and then. here you go. Now. let's watch this
Console more carefully. I'll clear it. My

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.770
left stick is going to the left now. and I'm
getting -1. halfway left I get -1/2. centralized

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.810
I get nearly 0. so. sue me it's just a round
0. In fact. every time you let go of the stick.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.930
it'll settle on something different. Here
it's settled on 0.002. now 0.01. so it's not

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.140
going to be precise. and then. vertically
the same thing. OK. so you get numbers between

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.000
-1 and 1. depending on your stick position.
OK. that's all very well. so how about if

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.970
you don't have a game-pad. Well. regardless
you want to customize the input for a player

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.510
on mouse and keyboard. So. go to Project Settings
and Input. and let's just take a look at all

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.080
of these different things here. that you can
get to control for each of the 18 inputs.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.500
So. there's an array of 18 things. Horizontal.
Vertical. Fire. etc. I'm going to look at

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.620
Horizontal for now. and it's basically the
same for the rest. apart from buttons are

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.560
simplified. but basically they're very similar.
So. this thing is called Horizontal. it doesn't

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.050
have a descriptive name. we could give it
a descriptive name. What does that mean? Well.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.050
here is Unity's doc here. just search for
Input Manager on Google. and it'll go through

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.030
and explain. So. it's a detailed definition
that's displayed in the Game Launcher. you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.880
know that launcher I showed you in the previous
video. the descriptive negative name. So.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.050
that's for the negative button. the button
that does the reverse of what we're asking

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.670
it to do. and then. the positive button. is
the... So. let me put this a different way.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.360
Negative and Horizontal is left and positive
is right. if that makes sense. and in Vertical

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.480
of course negative would be up and positive
would be down. etc.. or the other way around.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.790
you get the idea. So. you can also have alternative
buttons. so you can either use the Left or

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.180
the Right Arrow. or you can us the A or the
D Key. Now. Gravity. what is Gravity all about?

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.420
It's actually the number of inths of a second
that the control takes to read the center. so

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.069
this is a third of a second. It could be a
1/15 of a second. if you put 15. it could

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.660
a oneth of a second. if you put 1. let me
show you. So. if we leave it at the default

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.700
and we hold the key off to the side... I'm
actually going to make you focus just at the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.110
very bottom left here. If I hold it to one
side and get -1-ish. and then. when I let

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.090
go it should take a 1/3 of a second to go
back and it does. about a 1/3. If I set this

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.730
to 1. not Sensitivity. Gravity to 1. then
it will take about 1 second. 1.000 and it

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.030
gets to about 0. OK. let's prove this is right.
by setting it to 0.1. and it should take 10

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.840
seconds now. Off to the side. 1.000. 2.000.
3.000. 4. you get the idea. OK. and then.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.040
it moves down in quite small steps. which
means that if you set your Gravity too high.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.799
a number. so I want it to go back to the center
in a 1/20 of a second. watch what happens

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.139
now. I go to -1. I let go and it ends up a
0.3. because it's got so few time steps. it

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.849
has to reduce the value. so much in each time
step that we get a rounding problem. depending

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.749
on your current frame rate. So. avoid graveties
that are large like that. and 3 is a sensible

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:41.610
Gravity that is probably about as long as
it takes a controller's stick to return to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.419
center. which is probably why Unity would
have used it. Alright. so that's what Gravity

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.520
is. I'm going to leave it at 3. Dead is Dead
Zone. that's saying when you're on a controller.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.569
how much of the stick movement do we ignore?
So. that's that central Dead Zone. Sensitivity

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.939
has to do with the scaling of the way the
stick works. again. if you're not sure. look

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:05.539
in here. OK. so when I say the stick. the
Virtual Stick. it's only for virtual input.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.210
The same with Gravity. only for mouse and
keyboard. OK. the same with the Sensitivity.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.479
so the Sensitivity is like you've got a stronger
stick. so it just moves up faster. basically

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.490
as a simple way of looking at Sensitivity.
and Gravity is how fast the figure moves back

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.539
down. So. if you want it to take 10 seconds
to move up to Maximum and 10 seconds to move

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.039
down. then you set 0.1 and 0.1 and look at
how long it's taking. Alright. so this is

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.009
the easy way to think of it; 1 divided by
this number tells you how many seconds it

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.960
will take to get to full control displacement.
OK. so you might want it to go to full control

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:47.089
displacement. on the way up. quicker. you
know in 1 second. for example. or in a 1/10

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:50.430
of a second. but we may end up with the same
rounding problem here. You see we're only

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.009
getting to a Maximum of 0.83. that's the disadvantage.
because of a rounding issue. Not very good

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.699
really. to be honest. but something that can
combat that is Snap. So. what Snap does. is

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.460
it means if you hold down both directions.
like I'm holding down Right now. if I then.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.479
hold down Left at the same time as Right.
what it'll do is it'll Snap back to 0. in

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.849
theory. but again. it's not super reliable
but that's the idea of it. You can invert

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.400
the axis. you can change it's type. and we'll
look at all that later. if need to. OK. so

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.559
we've had a good overview of how this works.
Remember that any changes you make here. when

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:26.639
you're in Play Mode. when you come out of
Play Mode. then. they are likely to be lost.

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.009
So. I said 0.1 of the Gravity. I come out
of Play Mode and of course it's lost. So.

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.719
that's your normal gotcha. that's why we use
a Play Mode Tint. OK. so there you go. Fantastic!

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:40.939
We understand more about Gravity and controllers
now. and in the next video we will look at

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.740
responding to the platform. We'll start to
think about creating a menu system that depends

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.979
on the platform in use. That'll be fun! See
you soon!
