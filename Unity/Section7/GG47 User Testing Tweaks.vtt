1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome back! So, as a

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
result of playing on the mobile, there's a couple of tweaks

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we can make. So, in this video, we're going to make a simplification,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
by removing a script

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
altogether. It's just something that Marco spotted. Thanks for that,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Marco! Number 2, we're going to destroy tagged objects,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
when our win condition comes up. So, at the moment

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that "You Win" text appears in front of,

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
sorry behind the defenders, and that looks really bad,

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but we also have another "You Win" issue, which is that my

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
wife tells me that it looks a bit strange that the

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
attackers and defenders keep moving, when we win.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, we can solve all of that, by just destroying all

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of the game objects, when we win, and we'll

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
learn about tags as well. And we'll add a simple

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Stop Button to the game, so that people can actually get out of it

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
if they want to. Cool! So firstly, let's make the

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
simplification to the Music System. So, if you

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
remember over in our Start Scene, we've got this Scripts object

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with this start SetStartVolume script, attached

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to it, which is quite a long script

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
does a load of stuff. Let's get rid of it! We don't need it at all! OK,

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
all we need is this line here. PlayerPrefsManager.GetMaster

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Volume(); so, I'm going to copy that, and then,

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm going to boldly delete, not only the Scripts object

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
on the Start Menu, but if we go into the Scripts

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Folder, I'm also going to delete the actual script, which is called

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
SetStartVolume. And then, if you go

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
into your MusicManager, in the Start of the Music

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Manager, you can simply in there go

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
audioSource

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
.volume

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
= PlayerPrefsManager.Get

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
MasterVolume(); and as a

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
recap, what that's doing is it is ensuring that when we

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
start the game,

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we get the Splash Screen with it's default level sound,

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and then, we want on this scene the volume to be loaded. And it

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is! If I set my volume down, to a quarter,

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and then play again from the Splash Screen,

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we can confirm that, that

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Start method is indeed setting the volume

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
from the Player Prefs. Fantastic! So, that item is done!

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Thanks, Marco! Number 2, we want to destroy all tagged

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
objects on Win condition. So, what I mean by

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that is, at the end of the game, when we win,

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I want everything that is tagged with

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
destroy to disappear immediately,

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
before the "You Won!" comes up over the top. I want all the play

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
space to clear, so how are we going to achieve that?

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Well, let's create a tag and stick it on

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the appropriate defenders, etc. So, say I stick this

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
tag on just the cactus and the gnome, for now.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So, select the cactus and gnome or a couple of your

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
defenders, for testing purposes. Go over

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
into the Inspector and click on Tag

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and then Add Tag.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Fantastic! So then, once we've done

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that, we're going to create ourselves a new tag

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
called DestroyOnWin. So, I've got a mess

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
here, I don't need this win, I just need a single sized

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
tag array, Destroy

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
OnWin. I recommend you copy that, so that

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
we paste it perfectly into the script later on.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So, that's creating the tag, but you still need to

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
apply it to the cactus and gnome, so you can multi-select

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and then Apply DestroyOnWin. I'm only doing those

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
two for now, just for testing.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
OK, so where are we going to make this destroy

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
OnWinBehavior happen? Well, it's going to happen over

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
on the Game Timer, because that's the thing

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that actually does the win. So, I'm going to get you

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
started, and then, once you're started I'm going to

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
leave it to you to do the meat

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
of this thing. It's pretty simple. So,

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
what happens in this method? This Update is getting to

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
big, so it basically updates the slider, every frame,

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and then, it says if the time's up

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
then do something. When it's the time up

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and it's the end of the level, do something. So, I'm going to refactor

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
out this body of this Update, because it's gotten too big.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, I'm going to highlight it all, refactor, extract

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
method, bring it down, and then

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
call it Handle

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
WinCondition ();

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
so that operates exactly the same, it's just much clearer to read

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
what's happening in Update. Now, HandleWinCondition () does everything else.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So, what I want to do is immediately

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that the WinCondition happens, I want to do one more thing, which is

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
DestroyAllTagged

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Objects();

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
OK, and that's a method, which you're going to write in a second.

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So, here's the signature for it, void DestroyAllTagged

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Objects(), and what I want that method to

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
do is to just go through and destroy all objects

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
with a tag. And let's put this in the comments.

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
"// Destroys all objects

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
with". Now, we need to go and get

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
the tag name again, because I've overwritten it,

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
into one of your objects, into the defenders

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
into the Tag Menu, destroyOnWin. And it's really

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
important to get that capitalization right.

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
OK, so "// Destroys all objects with

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
destroyOnWin tag". So, that's what I want you to write.

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I want you to write a method, that goes and finds all those objects

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
hits right through them and destroys them. Here's your challenge slide!

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You can test by setting on all but

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
one defender type, so what I'm saying there is, you could put down maybe a gnome

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and a cactus and a gravestone, and you should see at the end of that level that, just the

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
gnome and the cactus disappear but the gravestone stays.

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
If you want a stepping stone, to make sure it's not destroying

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
absolutely everything. And then, tag everything,

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
all your defenders, attackers, and projectiles, everything

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that you want to destroy at the end of the level when you win, and then

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
test by playing it. So go ahead, pause the video do that challenge

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
now!

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Cool welcome back! So, let's

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
get this done! It isn't too tricky, really!

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So, we need a GameObject array. Why not an object

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
array? Well, you could use an object, but

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
we may have problems with finding

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
appropriate methods to find objects and with destroying objects. So, Game

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Object is the correct level to work at.

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So, if we call this Game

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Object array taggedObjectArray, then how do we

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
find it? Well, it's GameObject.find.

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And then, I'm going to introduce you to a new one here. FindGame

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
ObjectsWithTag, and if you look at the method for that, it

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
returns a GameObject array, which is just what we want.

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Then, as a string, we give it this ("destroyOnWin")

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
string. Fantastic! So now, we have an array of GameObjects.

132
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So, it's now literally a question of just iterating over

133
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to them. Foreach, then just kind of speak

134
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in English. I would

135
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
consider iterating over Objects

136
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
other than GameObjects here, but I think either will work.

137
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Let's start with GameObjects for simplicity and see if it works.

138
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
For each (GameObjectTagged

139
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Object in taggedObjectArray,

140
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
what are we going to do? Well, we're simply going to

141
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Destroy (taggedObject);

142
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Alright, let's try it!

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So, I may need to go to my Level Canvas

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and my Game Timer. I'll just show you that code again,

145
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
for a second. That's my final code, I know I flicked off it

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
a bit too quick. So, this is my solution,

147
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
let's try it. OK, so the Game Timer I'm going to set

148
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
down to say 6 seconds, for a minute, just to check it.

149
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Let's try running, putting these

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
guys down, and seeing if they get destroyed.

151
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
"YOU WON!" and off they go!

152
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Perfect! So, that's working really well.

153
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
OK fantastic! So, that's the method we need.

154
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I just need to now go ahead and tag and prefab everything

155
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
correctly, so let's do that! Let's go into our prefabs.

156
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
All of our Defenders, tag them with destroyOnWin,

157
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
all of our Attackers, tag them with destroyOnWin,

158
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and all of your Projectiles, tag with destroy

159
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
OnWin. Remember to leave your game timer as something sensible,

160
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
100 works really well with the Glitch Garden

161
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
music I chose. After three levels the music just about stops.

162
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The final thing you need to do is, re-prefab...

163
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
No you don't, that's fine! You've effected the

164
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
prefabs directly, so that's fine. That's working really,

165
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
really well. If you want to check it you're welcome to, but I'm

166
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
confident that, that logic will work. So, what's the last thing we

167
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
going to be doing?

168
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Add a simple Stop Button to the game. So, what I'm thinking

169
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is maybe down at the bottom right somewhere. Remember, inside the iPad

170
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Safe Play Area, so perhaps here

171
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
where my mouse is pointing right now, just

172
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
there. Put a Stop Button. I've got

173
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
a Stop Image in the Course Assets, which you can get access to,

174
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and what I want you to do is make it yourself. The Stop Button wants to simply

175
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
take them back to the Start Scene. And for extra credit,

176
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
it would put a popup, allowing them to continue or

177
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
not. So, have a go at just making a simple Stop Button

178
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
now, that takes people back to the Start Scene.

179
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
OK, so hopefully this

180
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is a relatively simple job. Let's give it a go! I'm going to import an asset.

181
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You can go and get this from anywhere, by the way. Just go to Google Images and

182
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
search for a stop sign. This is really not a particularly cleaver image.

183
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We don't need Mip Maps on it. Where are we going to

184
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
put it? I'm going to put it in the Buttons Prefab. There's already

185
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
a Buttons Prefab here and a Buttons Canvas Element,

186
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and within that, I'm going to create a UI image.

187
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I'm going to give that image the

188
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
sprite, which is the stop sign. It must be assigned as a sprite.

189
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It's massive, at the moment! Arguably bigger than we need

190
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
but that's OK. In the UI Editor Mode,

191
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I'm going to squeeze that right down holding down Shift as I do,

192
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
so that it resizes without changing its proportions.

193
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You may have to do this a couple of times to get it down

194
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to the size you need. I'm

195
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
going to pop mine right down, in the bottom here.

196
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Don't be afraid to zoom right in, so you can see what

197
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
you're doing in these instances, and then,

198
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
it's just a question of resizing it right down

199
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and popping it somewhere like that. Perfect! OK,

200
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
so what else are you going to need on this button, in order for it to respond to

201
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
mouse presses? Well, I'm going to give it a sensible

202
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
name, Stop. But you're going to need a collider on it, right?

203
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, a Box Collider 2D would do absolutely fine

204
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and it can be a trigger. The final thing we're going to need is a script

205
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
to handle a click. So, I'm just going to call it StopButton

206
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
very cryptically. Put it in this

207
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Scripts Folder, and then,

208
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
go edit that Stop Button Script. And that

209
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Stop Button Script is simply going to say the following:

210
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
void OnMouseDown(),

211
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and then now, we need to load level.

212
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
We're going to load the Start Scene. Let's get the exact name

213
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
of it 01a Start, as a string.

214
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
LevelManager, remember it's a

215
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
static, so we don't even need to worry about whether it's here

216
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
or do we? Well, let's try it! LevelManager dot...

217
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
You see, we need to be careful about which Level

218
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Manager is which. This is a type LevelManager now,

219
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
but we do need to find an instance of the Level

220
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Manager, so we are going to have to do that at the Start.

221
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Have a think about a script that already does this, finding

222
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
the LevelManager, like the LoseCollider. It already

223
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
does the private LevelManger levelManger; levelManger =

224
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
GameObject.FindObjectOfType, so copy

225
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that. Why not get a leg up? Paste that in to

226
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
your Stop Button. And then,

227
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
you can use the instance of the LevelManger. Here he is,

228
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
.LoadLevel, and now we just give it that

229
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
string name. Oops, not that string name, but

230
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
the Start Menu string.

231
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And that's it! Let's have a go!

232
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Let's check that, that Stop Button works, and then all we have to do is prefab it.

233
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Stop and it takes you back here! OK, it's pretty

234
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
jarring, and it would be better if you want to do the extra credit of having a popup

235
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
screen, but I think we could refine this game forever

236
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and never get on with the rest of the course or courses. So,

237
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I think that this is a great position to stop. It's a playable fun game

238
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
now. All we have to do is apply this Buttons Prefab

239
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
back, so apply that to the prefab.

240
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Click on Buttons in your Hierarchy, and apply in the Inspector,

241
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
at the top right. Go to your prefabs and check that the button

242
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
contains a Stop Element. It does! Go to your other scenes,

243
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
all of your other levels, and make sure

244
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that under Buttons, click on Buttons and click Revert and that will

245
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
take you back to the prefab. And do the

246
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
same in the other level, if you need to. You don't in this one, because the prefab

247
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
connection was maintained. So now, all of your levels

248
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
have this Stop Button in them, and you are good to

249
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
go. So congratulations! You really have finished

250
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Glitch Garden now. I really look forward to seeing what you

251
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
come up with, seeing what assets you find or create

252
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and what you can make. I look forward to all your tweaks. We get

253
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
so excited by what you guys share! Please build to

254
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
the web now, zip it up, stick it on Game Bucket, and share

255
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
share it in the community and share it on the Facebook group. So,

256
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
thank you very much for being our student, on this section and in this course,

257
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.733
and we'll see you soon!
