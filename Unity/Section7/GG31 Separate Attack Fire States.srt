00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:10.300
So in this video let's take a look at why our gnome.
or my gnome in my case is firing too fast

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.710
Possible solutions to that type of issue:
why are we choosing to create a separate firing

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.119
state and then we'll fine tune
everything get. it working nice. OK so

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.170
let's take a quick look at the problem.
the problem is that once in the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.800
attacking state. in fact it while we sort
this I'm gonna set the gnome's default

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.179
attacking state - default animation state
to attacking alright. so I'm going to go

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.690
into is attacking here rather than
changing the default state I'm going to set

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.510
the default parameter for both the gnome
and the cactus to is attacking so we can

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.889
immediately see them attacking rather
that change the default states. so they're

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:51.399
attacking all the time now. what's
happening here?

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.670
Well if you look at the cactus it has an
animation that consists of quite a few

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.389
frames well 30 frames a second; 2. 10 so
must be about... I don't know seventy frames

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:07.770
70 something frames. so we're firing once in
seventy something frames when it comes

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.490
to the cactus. so once every two and a bit

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.740
seconds. and that's what we see over in
the game; well we would if the cactus was

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.850
still alive; and then how about when it
comes to the gnome? Well look at the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.300
gnome's animation. he only has a few
frames. literally a handful of frames. and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.620
how many frames? Exactly 11 frames. so
his animation last less than a

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.420
second you see. your second is over here. about a
third of a second. So in comparison the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.750
gnome is firing three times every second.
in fact dammit I'm going to put myself

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.340
another gnome - I have an abundance
mentality when it comes to gnomes; I can

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.370
have another gnome. Oops...

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.970
54.9. he's well high. OK and I'll have
another cactus because I want them out of

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.310
the attack line. OK fine. so watch this.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.079
The gnome is firing three times a second.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.250
crazy. what can we do about it? Well
there's a hacky way of sorting it which

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.630
is to go to the gnome and go well. why don't
we put more frames of animation in? It's kind

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.550
of ugly right. I don't really want the speed
he fires at to depend on the number of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.760
frames in the animation. I'm certainly not going to copy frames and paste them in and stuff.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.120
rubbish. Why don't we use the animator to
solve this? Why don't we create a new

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.989
state called fire? It doesn't change
anything else. everything else can just

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.000
go in and out of attack but the animator
itself go to attack to fire and back after a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.630
certain number of loops of attack .and
then it's fire that will actually do the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.299
firing. Does that make sense? Just one more
state here over on the right? Of course it does.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.340
so that's going to be a simple solution
we only need to in my case do it for the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.080
gnome. you could of course also do it on
your cactus. whatever characters

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.069
you've created you know. you may need
to do a similar thing I just wanna show

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.709
you this technique. Am I gonna show
you how to do it?

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.190
yes. Am I gonna show you how to do it before you try
it yourself? No. we really want you

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.160
doing the challenges. I hope you haven't
slipped out of habit of doing the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.750
challenges. if you have this is a great
time to turn over a new leaf because

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.079
we're nearing the end of this 2D
course and we are going to need to be

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.370
leaving you to be able to do your own
things and think for yourself. So create

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.600
a new state called fire. transition into it
after a certain number of loops of

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.100
attack it's up to you; use attack motion
in fire state for now. so what do I mean

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.709
by that? What I'm saying is that what are
you going to use as an animation clip

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.090
when he's firing? Well in my game I'm
going to use the same motion - the same

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.370
attack motion and then move your fire
event to the fire estate and test it all works. So

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.130
go ahead and do that now.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.620
Welcome back. so let's make this happen.
So we need a state firstly called fire.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.930
so that's simple enough. Now in this fire
state we're going to use the same motion

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.220
as the attack motion but can we use
exactly the same motion? Well no because

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.890
this motion here is... would end up
being exactly the same for fire and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.980
attack. we need the same sprites but we
need a different motion if that makes sense.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.569
because we're going to have -
when we go to this line here:

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.900
gnome firing. we want a different clip so
actually a new way. a different way which

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.019
you've seen before

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.290
of creating a new state is to just say
create new clip and you can call it well

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.290
what let's go to our animations put it
in the right place or a sensible place

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:42.560
and what is it? It's the gnome firing; ok
so gnome firing. Now we have a motion for

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.330
gnome firing and we have a name. I'm just
going to simplify the name of the state to

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.310
firing and then the motion we just
recreate actually so it's going to be

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.410
simpler to just recreate it. and what - how
do we create it? Well. just go and get your

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:06.090
sprites right? It's his hopping motion that
we want to put in here

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.220
fine and the reason for that is now we
have a different motion here that we can

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.240
choose in the attacking state we're gonna
remove that event and in the firing

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.000
state which looks exactly the same we're
going to add in a fire. Now let's watch

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.240
him animate and see how he does. OK so fine
but we haven't put any transitions in

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.360
yet so let's put a transition in and
let's say after five cycles of attack

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.890
you go to firing and then after one
cycle of firing which is the default you

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:50.450
go back to attack. Is that working? Not
really. so because 5 never got stored.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.150
OK. let's try that

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.960
1. 2. 3. 4. 5 fire 1. 2. 3. 4. 5 fire - you get the idea? Now is
he still animating when we go to the

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.160
firing state? He appears not to be. he
appears that when he's firing he's not

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.320
doing anything. So what's that about?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.160
Gnome attacking changes the body sprite. gnome
firing tries to change the gnome sprite and

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.400
is no gnome sprite so we have again
to be careful that it is the body's sprite

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.370
renderers sprite that we are changing and we
need to create this a bit carefully so we are

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.210
making we are making it a little bit
difficult for ourselves by having these

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.300
these childed bodies here because the
animator doesn't quite work how we

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.139
want it to but it does really reinforce
how it works and gives you a lot more

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:42.070
flexibility so I'm going to stick with
it. I'm quite happy. Here he goes. he fires and

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.780
when he's firing he's still exhibiting
exactly the same animation. in fact he's not

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.380
pitching even so great alright? That's a
lot more sensible and now you control

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.340
your fire rate in here. So that bit's done.
let's take a look back to our challenge

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:02.190
and see what else we needed to do. Guess what.
we've done it. so what we gonna

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.039
do just to finish off is the bottom here.
fine tune the projectile size and spawn

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:10.889
position. So let's start off with the
gnome. I'm going to apply his prefab back

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:17.470
take a look at him and in slow motion. so
push pause. go back to the scene view.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.520
and just frame-by-frame let's see what
happen. Well actually we'd beter wait 'til

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.550
he's in the attacking state. could be a
while. OK here we go. so there is that axe ok? Just

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.160
look at in real-time yeah it's ok it's a
bit big and it's coming out a bit low so

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.110
pretty easy to sort that out it's coming
out low so you move the gun up a bit so

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:46.789
like so. and then it's a bit big so you
simply go to the pre-fab for it. for the

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:55.330
axe. and you go to its not the axe
itself but to its sprite and let's just

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.139
make it eighty percent of the size let's
say in X and Y. Now it'll be higher and

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:07.479
smaller when it comes out of the gnome. OK it's
smaller for sure. I'm not particularly sure

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:11.990
that it's any higher so let's make sure
that we apply that back to the pre-fab

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:18.409
and possibly move it up a little bit more.
OK so that's moving the gun moves the

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:22.820
vertical position and horizontal.
in fact it needs a horizontal

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.540
position coming out because it's kinda
coming out of his face right now.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.470
Anyway I don't need to obsessively tune
this. I will leave it to you guys

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.950
to make far better versions of this game
than we have got the time to make but

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.930
the point is you've got control over the
size of this axe and the position it

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:43.390
spawns at. OK. so that's great now
again same thing quickly for the

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:50.200
cactus. how's the spawning going?
Well the courgette's far. far too big so

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.690
let's just make the sprite of the
courgette a bit smaller. let's find ourselves a

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.030
courgette. put in the scene so we can
see how big we want it and then on this

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:05.800
instance of the courgette go to its body.
the scale tool. scale it down and then apply

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:16.210
that back to the courgette prefab and remove the instance. Alright. let's try it. Great so now the

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.450
firing animations are sensible you might
say how about if I want to change the

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.900
fire rate in script well that's one of
the tradeoffs we're making here. you could

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.870
but you'd have to be accessing animator
properties. it's a bit of a weird thing

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.210
to do. so the purpose of this is that
we're having a consistent fire rate but

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.800
it's up to the animator to be able to choose
when. By the way notice that these axes

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.280
continue even after the gnome has died
which is exactly the behavior that we

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.400
want. So this stone is standing up
well to the lizard's attack... in the next

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.910
video we need to get the projectiles
actually hitting the attackers and only

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.380
the attackers. not other defenders and
not... well that's it.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.530
Not other defenders basically. and 
not other projectiles as well.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.500
OK so we'll look forward to doing that in a
moment. See you soon.

00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,300
So in this video let's take a look at why our gnome,
or my gnome in my case is firing too fast

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,710
Possible solutions to that type of issue:
why are we choosing to create a separate firing

00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,119
state and then we'll fine tune
everything get, it working nice. OK so

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,170
let's take a quick look at the problem,
the problem is that once in the

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,800
attacking state, in fact it while we sort
this I'm gonna set the gnome's default

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,179
attacking state - default animation state
to attacking alright, so I'm going to go

00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,690
into is attacking here rather than
changing the default state I'm going to set

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,510
the default parameter for both the gnome
and the cactus to is attacking so we can

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,889
immediately see them attacking rather
that change the default states, so they're

00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:51,399
attacking all the time now, what's
happening here?

00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,670
Well if you look at the cactus it has an
animation that consists of quite a few

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,389
frames well 30 frames a second; 2, 10 so
must be about... I don't know seventy frames

00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:07,770
70 something frames, so we're firing once in
seventy something frames when it comes

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,490
to the cactus, so once every two and a bit

00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,740
seconds, and that's what we see over in
the game; well we would if the cactus was

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,850
still alive; and then how about when it
comes to the gnome? Well look at the

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:29,300
gnome's animation, he only has a few

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,620
how many frames? Exactly 11 frames, so
his animation last less than a

00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,420
second you see, your second is over here, about a
third of a second. So in comparison the

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,750
gnome is firing three times every second,
in fact dammit I'm going to put myself

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,340
another gnome - I have an abundance
mentality when it comes to gnomes; I can

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,370
have another gnome. Oops...

00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,970
54.9, he's well high. OK and I'll have
another cactus because I want them out of

00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,310
the attack line. OK fine, so watch this.

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,079
The gnome is firing three times a second,

00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,250
crazy, what can we do about it? Well
there's a hacky way of sorting it which

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,630
is to go to the gnome and go well, why don't
we put more frames of animation in? It's kind

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,550
of ugly right, I don't really want the speed
he fires at to depend on the number of

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,760
frames in the animation, I'm certainly not going to copy frames and paste them in and stuff,

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,120
rubbish. Why don't we use the animator to

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,630
certain number of loops of attack ,and
then it's fire that will actually do the

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,299
firing. Does that make sense? Just one more
state here over on the right? Of course it does,

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,340
so that's going to be a simple solution
we only need to in my case do it for the

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,080
gnome, you could of course also do it on
your cactus, whatever characters

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,069
you've created you know. you may need
to do a similar thing I just wanna show

00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,709
you this technique. Am I gonna show
you how to do it?

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,190
yes. Am I gonna show you how to do it before you try
it yourself? No, we really want you

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,160
doing the challenges. I hope you haven't
slipped out of habit of doing the

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,750
challenges, if you have this is a great
time to turn over a new leaf because

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,079
we're nearing the end of this 2D
course and we are going to need to be

00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:18,370
leaving you to be able to do your own
things and think for yourself. So create

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,600
a new state called fire, transition into it
after a certain number of loops of

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,100
attack it's up to you; use attack motion
in fire state for now, so what do I mean

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,709
by that? What I'm saying is that what are
you going to use as an animation clip

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,090
when he's firing? Well in my game I'm
going to use the same motion - the same

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,370
attack motion and then move your fire
event to the fire estate and test it all works. So

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,130
go ahead and do that now.

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:50,620
Welcome back, so let's make this happen.
So we need a state firstly called fire,

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,930
so that's simple enough. Now in this fire
state we're going to use the same motion

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,220
as the attack motion but can we use
exactly the same motion? Well no because

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,890
this motion here is... would end up
being exactly the same for fire and

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,980
attack, we need the same sprites but we
need a different motion if that makes sense,

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,569
because we're going to have -
when we go to this line here:

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,900
gnome firing, we want a different clip so
actually a new way, a different way which

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,019
you've seen before

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,290
of creating a new state is to just say
create new clip and you can call it well

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,290
what let's go to our animations put it
in the right place or a sensible place

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:42,560
and what is it? It's the gnome firing; ok
so gnome firing. Now we have a motion for

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,330
gnome firing and we have a name, I'm just
going to simplify the name of the state to

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,310
firing and then the motion we just
recreate actually so it's going to be

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,410
simpler to just recreate it, and what - how
do we create it? Well, just go and get your

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:06,090
sprites right? It's his hopping motion that
we want to put in here

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,220
fine and the reason for that is now we
have a different motion here that we can

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,240
choose in the attacking state we're gonna
remove that event and in the firing

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,000
state which looks exactly the same we're
going to add in a fire. Now let's watch

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,240
him animate and see how he does. OK so fine
but we haven't put any transitions in

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,360
yet so let's put a transition in and
let's say after five cycles of attack

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,890
you go to firing and then after one
cycle of firing which is the default you

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:50,450
go back to attack. Is that working? Not
really, so because 5 never got stored,

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,150
OK, let's try that

00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:00,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 fire 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 fire - you get the idea? Now is
he still animating when we go to the

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,160
firing state? He appears not to be, he
appears that when he's firing he's not

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,320
doing anything. So what's that about?

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,160
Gnome attacking changes the body sprite, gnome
firing tries to change the gnome sprite and

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,400
is no gnome sprite so we have again
to be careful that it is the body's sprite

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,370
renderers sprite that we are changing and we
need to create this a bit carefully so we are

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,210
making we are making it a little bit
difficult for ourselves by having these

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,300
these childed bodies here because the
animator doesn't quite work how we

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,139
want it to but it does really reinforce
how it works and gives you a lot more

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:42,070
flexibility so I'm going to stick with
it, I'm quite happy. Here he goes, he fires and

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,780
when he's firing he's still exhibiting
exactly the same animation, in fact he's not

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,380
pitching even so great alright? That's a
lot more sensible and now you control

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,340
your fire rate in here. So that bit's done,
let's take a look back to our challenge

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:02,190
and see what else we needed to do. Guess what,
we've done it, so what we gonna

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,039
do just to finish off is the bottom here,
fine tune the projectile size and spawn

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,889
position. So let's start off with the
gnome, I'm going to apply his prefab back

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:17,470
take a look at him and in slow motion, so
push pause, go back to the scene view,

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,520
and just frame-by-frame let's see what
happen. Well actually we'd beter wait 'til

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,550
he's in the attacking state, could be a
while. OK here we go, so there is that axe ok? Just

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,160
look at in real-time yeah it's ok it's a
bit big and it's coming out a bit low so

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,110
pretty easy to sort that out it's coming
out low so you move the gun up a bit so

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:46,789
like so, and then it's a bit big so you
simply go to the pre-fab for it, for the

00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:55,330
axe, and you go to its not the axe
itself but to its sprite and let's just

00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,139
make it eighty percent of the size let's
say in X and Y. Now it'll be higher and

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:07,479
smaller when it comes out of the gnome. OK it's
smaller for sure, I'm not particularly sure

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,990
that it's any higher so let's make sure
that we apply that back to the pre-fab

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:18,409
and possibly move it up a little bit more.
OK so that's moving the gun moves the

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:22,820
vertical position and horizontal,
in fact it needs a horizontal

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,540
position coming out because it's kinda
coming out of his face right now.

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,470
Anyway I don't need to obsessively tune
this, I will leave it to you guys

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,950
to make far better versions of this game
than we have got the time to make but

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,930
the point is you've got control over the
size of this axe and the position it

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:43,390
spawns at, OK, so that's great now
again same thing quickly for the

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:50,200
cactus, how's the spawning going?
Well the courgette's far, far too big so

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,690
let's just make the sprite of the
courgette a bit smaller, let's find ourselves a

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,030
courgette, put in the scene so we can
see how big we want it and then on this

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:05,800
instance of the courgette go to its body,
the scale tool, scale it down and then apply

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:16,210
that back to the courgette prefab and remove the instance. Alright, let's try it. Great so now the

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,450
firing animations are sensible you might
say how about if I want to change the

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,900
fire rate in script well that's one of
the tradeoffs we're making here, you could

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,870
but you'd have to be accessing animator
properties, it's a bit of a weird thing

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,210
to do, so the purpose of this is that
we're having a consistent fire rate but

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,800
it's up to the animator to be able to choose
when. By the way notice that these axes

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,280
continue even after the gnome has died
which is exactly the behavior that we

00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,400
want. So this stone is standing up
well to the lizard's attack... in the next

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,910
video we need to get the projectiles
actually hitting the attackers and only

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,380
the attackers, not other defenders and
not... well that's it.

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,530
Not other defenders basically, and 
not other projectiles as well.

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,500
OK so we'll look forward to doing that in a
moment. See you soon.
