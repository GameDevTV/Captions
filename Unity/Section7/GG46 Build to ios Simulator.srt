00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome back!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this video we'll be setting up Build Settings in Unity.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
building to the iOS simulator. You'll need a

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Mac or at least a Mac emulator. though that's naughty.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
To build to a physical device. you

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
would need. again. possibly a way around it. but you would need a dev

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
kit. so we're just going to build to the simulator.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Briefly play-test and note any improvements. and then I want you to

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
share your creation with the world. So. I'm going to

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
show you how to do it. and then at the end. like the Android video

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to show you. or challenge you rather. how to do it.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So. let's go ahead and go into Glitch Garden. Go to

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
File and Build Settings and click on

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
iOS and then Switch Platform.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And the little Unity logo will eventually move across from Android

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to iOS. Now. it's reimporting assets

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and making sure that they're all compatible with iOS. A notable difference

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is that .ogg sound files aren't compatible. so you

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
may have got an error. at this stage. asking you to change the format

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of one of your sound files. If you have then.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
for changing graphics files. then I suggest you

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
look at gimp.org. and you can change from pretty much any format

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to any format. And for changing sound files. take a look at

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
audacity.sourceforge.net

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Again. free and available for Mac and PC.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So. assuming that you've got this far and that you have switched

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Build Setting over to iOS. converting any assets

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that you may need to. We now need to click into the player

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
settings and start taking a look. So. Company Name.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
you can change it if you want. it's not vital. I'm going to put in Embrace

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
IT. my company name. Product Name. I would give it a name.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Glitch Garden. That makes a lot of sense. so that. that's the

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
thing that appears under the icon on the iOS.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now. talking about icons. let's have an icon. We currently

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
don't have an icon. and we didn't do an icon on the Android

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Build. So. let's sort that out now. I'm going to go over to

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
my Images Folder and import a new asset.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I've got one ready on my Desktop. but

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you can get this same file. either from the course asset.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that's at the beginning of the section. or by going to

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
glitchthegame.com.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
See all details in download links. and then

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
if you download all sprite sheets here. this large

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
.zip file. then it's contained within

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
there. And you can see my file name is npc non-player character

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
fox_fox_orange. etc. And I'm just going to use that one

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
as the icon. or I really encourage you to

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
go and find our own graphics. So.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
import into your Images. You can rename it. at this stage.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
if you like. I'm going to leave it as it is.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But before you carry on. change it to a Texture

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
up here in the Inspector. Texture Type. Texture.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Alpha from Transparency. in my case.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
so that it has a transparent background. and

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
make it Truecolor. not compressed.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So. it's type Texture. Alpha Is Transparency.

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and then Truecolor. and then Apply that.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Alright. now that is going to be

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
how you want it setup. If you want. go over to the iPhone

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and settings. but I'd leave those all as default. The only one you need to

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
change is the Default Tab here. to Truecolor. so it's not

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
compressed. OK fine! So. back into the

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Build Settings and Player Settings. Now.

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
where it says Default Icon. you actually have an icon to

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
drag right. You have a texture. which is your Fox. and you can drag it

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
into default icon here. or just select from default

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
icon. Perfect! We'll leave the cursor as it is. Let's go

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
through the rest of the options. Default Orientation.

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Auto Rotation is fine. Use Animated

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Autorotation. that's fine! We want to

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
un-tick Portrait and Portrait Upside Down. This is not a portrait

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
format game. so you just want the two landscape options.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So. the only change here. under Resolition and Presentation

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
for the iOS. is the portraits have been

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
unticked. Onto icon. you'll see.

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
very helpfully. Unity has created all the different required  icon sizes

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
for us. from that fox icon. Some of them are

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
probably bigger than the source icon. in my case. but don't worry.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
If you really want it to look sharp. then make sure it's

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
image is at least as big as 180 by 180.

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Splash Image we can't change. but we've done a

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
workaround. And then. here

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
very important. again you set up your Bundle Identifier. If you followed the

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Android Video. then this will all be set. Otherwise. you need to set com

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
dot your company name. or just your name. So. this could be com

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
dot John dot GlitchGarden.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Alright. Target Device. I'm going to go for

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
iPad only here. I've had a little bit of trouble getting

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
it to work on iPhone. so I'm going to go iPad only.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And then. let's move down

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to SDK Version. under Optimization.

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
That needs to be set to Simulator SDK.

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We're going to be deploying to the Simulator. so it's very important you set it to

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Simulator SDK. or you'll get some really strange errors.

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Target iOS version 4.3. It's a bit

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
old isn't it? It's up to you where you go here. I'm going to pick

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
7. so that it'll work on the last couple of generations.

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So. that's fine! Now. let's build and run!

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It'll ask us where we want to save the iOS Build

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
to. I'm just going to save it in my Downloads.

101
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and it's an iPad only build. So. it's

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
GG iOS build. iPad only.

103
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Now. while it compiles that. you may wonder why you want to save this

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
file. because this building process can take hours on a big project.

105
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and if you want to deploy it across multiple devices or share it with a friend.

106
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
then you're going to want to have the Xcode File.

107
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Before we worry about what happens over in

108
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Xcode. let me talk about two different things. Firstly. what has it just created?

109
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
If we look into it. this

110
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
GG iOS Build - iPad only. it's actually made an

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Xcode Project for us and all the subfolder we need.

112
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So. that's what it's created. and from Xcode we can deploy.

113
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Secondly. do you have Xcode running? Is it working

114
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
properly? If not. then just simply go to

115
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
developer... Just type Xcode into Google. and you'll get to the

116
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Apple Developer Xcode page. and under download you'll

117
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
see that the downloading and updating of Xcode is all

118
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
managed through the Mac app store.

119
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It'll open your Mac app store. like this. and in my case already. I have Xcode.

120
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I'm using Xcode 6.2. I

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
think. Let's have a look. 6.1.1. There you

122
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
go. Cool! So. once you're over here in Xcode.

123
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
go to the Xcode menu. and then. Open Developer

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Tool and iOS Simulator.

125
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And that will open up the iOS Simulator. like this. Now. I'm

126
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
going to leave mine on the iPad Air. You can choose your device here.

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Device. Hardware... Sorry.

128
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Hardware. Device. and then. Manage Devices. and you can put other

129
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
devices in. if you want. with this little + symbol at the bottom.

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So. I'm actually going to remove... I'll leave it as it is.

131
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
As long as I've got an iPad Air there. that's fine.

132
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
OK. so the other thing you may need to do is

133
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
zoom. because this isn't fitting on my screen. So. I'm going to scale this

134
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to 50%. Actually. it already is scaled to 50%

135
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
so I think it's going to be OK. once we get

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
into Landscape Mode. but Portrait won't fit on my screen. even at

137
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the 50% resolution. So. the simulator is working.

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
This is a simulated iPad working just fine here.

139
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
The Hardware Menu gives you access to like the Home Button.

140
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Cool! So. let's try it! Over back in Xcode. you should

141
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
just be able to play. You see. it's got Unity-iPhone. deploying to

142
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
iPad Air in the simulator. That's what that things at the top says.

143
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It's at the top left here. Try clicking Play and see what we get.

144
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
You are going to get a load of

145
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
warnings here. One of them may be that it wants to change the

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
settings. Just ignore it all for now. see if it runs. There's the Unity Splash

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
screen. It has a very loud sound.

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and there's Glitch Garden.  There comes our fade in.

149
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We can change the sound volume.

150
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Perfect! And then. play the game!

151
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Pretty awesome hey!

152
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Now. it is actually fitting on the iPad screen. Remember how we planned this to fit

153
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
on the iPad. It's working exactly like we thought.

154
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
but one thing we do notice. if you hit the Home Button by going

155
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Hardware and Home. it comes home. There's your

156
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
icon! OK. it looks a bit funny. but let's not obsess about the icon

157
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
this time! We'll get more into icons next time we deploy

158
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
to mobile. but if you click back into it look. you can only come back

159
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
here. How could we quit the game? We can't!

160
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So. the Quit Button works. but not

161
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
in the middle of the game play. We have no way of pausing.

162
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
so I'm capturing myself now a to do for

163
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Glitch Garden. which is to include some sort of simple Pause Menu.

164
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Otherwise. the player can't pause the game

165
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
or get out of it even. without...

166
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
The only way they could restart the game

167
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
completely. is to either die for to use the multitasking

168
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
system. on the iPad. to close the app by swiping.

169
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
which is pretty inconvenient. But that's basically it!

170
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We've got the deployment working. What I want you to do now is do it for yourself!

171
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Deploy to iOS and share. Get it running

172
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
on your iOS Simulator or on your device. if you have a Dev Kit.

173
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Excitedly show somebody. anybody. your wife. your dog. your

174
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
cat. somebody on the street! Capture a screenshot

175
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
of what you've done on iOS. and then. share in the

176
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
discussions or Facebook group and maybe

177
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
invite your friends into the Facebook group and see what they think your non-

178
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Unity course friends. So. good luck deploying to iOS

179
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.866
and I will see you soon!
