Hey guys Ben here! So firstly.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
this video has been inserted after the main production of the course.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That's why we have a white background and slightly different production standards.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So. one of our students very kindly pointed out that we're

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
about to dive into Player Prefs. and we're going

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to straight way modify it. So. why are we doing that? Well.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
let me just give you a brief overview. Firstly. Player Prefs

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
are a piece of Persistent Storage. on your device.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now. this is very abstracted. you don't need to worry about whether

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it's an Xbox. a PlayStation. a telephone. a Mac. a PC.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or what it is. Always. when Unity is

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
running a game on it. there's a little bit of storage set aside

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
for Player Preferences. Now. this storage is unencrypted.

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so if you use it for things like level unlocks. then a

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
wise hacker can very easily go into that Player Prefs

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
File. in the Hex Editor for example. and unlock levels for themselves.

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so be aware of that. It's also very very slow to access. Now. by

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
very slow I mean measured in milliseconds.

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
not minutes or many seconds. but it's

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
slow to ba accessing this. certainly on a frame by frame basis

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you don't want to be doing it. So. there are a couple of the downfalls of Player Prefs.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now. the main one I'm addressing. with this wrapper that I'm creating

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is the fact that it's very easy to throw things into the

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Player Prefs Bucket and forget what you sent in there. If you

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
look at Unity's docs. you'll realize that you write

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
a Player Pref like this. You say. I want to set a

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Bool a string... I'm sorry. not a Bool. A

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
float an integer or a string. For a start. there's only three data

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
types. float. integer. string. and you take one of those.

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
let's say a float. and you give it a key

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a word. You say the. I don't know. the

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
player's speed is 1.3. So. you say player speed is the

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
key. and you put 1.3 in the bucket. Very very

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
well. but it's very easy to do

35
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that. from lots of different scripts and not to know what you've got in your Player

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Prefs. And if you check Unity's docs. you'll find that there's no way

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
of listing all of the different settings.

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
all of the different key value pairs. that you've

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
put into your Player Prefs. it's just not possible. The best you can

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
do is use the .HasKey method. to see if a given

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
key is there. That's pretty messy right. if you've got several scripts

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
writing into the Player Prefs. Or did I call it Player

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Speed or Players' Speed? I can't remember! You've got to through

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
all of it's mess! So. that's why I'm trading a Wrapper

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Class! That means that all of your rights. to the Player Prefs. go through a

46
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
series of Constants. that are defined at the top of a single

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
script. and that means that we've got a single. as I call it.

48
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
canonical place that we know that

49
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
all of the key value pairs that we want to work with. So. this will all come clear

50
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
as you go. So. we are slightly jumping in the deep end by

51
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
skipping over using naked Player Prefs. but don't worry.

52
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
using them on their own is really simple. You'll see the

53
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
lines of code in there. you just say write this

54
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
value with this key. But we're going to wrap it all up

55
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
more nicely than that. into our own Player Prefs Manager

56
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
static class. which will be right there when you  use your

57
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
auto-complete. ready to use. and it'll serve you well.

58
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in the future. So good luck! This will all come clear in the next video.

59
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.500
and I'll see you soon!
