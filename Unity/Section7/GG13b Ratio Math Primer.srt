Hey Welcome back. so this is a ratio math primer. in this
video will be looking at the

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.059
fundamentals of ratio math or maths

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.259
in England; what screen aspect ratios
mean and how to convert between

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.220
different aspects so here it is in
summary: so let's start with a pretty

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.900
common thing which is a 4:3 screen. the
old fashioned screen resolution of

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.270
televisions but also found in some
devices like iPads and the like so what

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.570
does a 4:3 screen mean? Well it simply
means that you've got four units of

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.660
something one way - they could be
centimeters. they could be a 40 pixels. it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.730
could be whatever - by three in the other
direction... just draw that a little more evenly. Something

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.200
like that

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.190
okay and then that is cool four colon
three. so it's a fraction four colon

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.800
three is the same as 4/3 which is the
same as for over 3 like that which is

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.040
the same as about 1.3 or one and a
third OK. 1 33333... or the mathematicians

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.790
might like to write it 1.3
recurring. Alright so that's what a 4:3

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.360
screen is what happens if we have a 16:9
screen how do we get from 4:3 to 16:9 and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.520
then how do we become fluid at translating
between the two? So I'm going to use red to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.780
represent the 16:9 screen. Well if we have
three squares vertically one way to get

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.060
to 9 would be to divide each of these
three into three. so if we just do that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.340
then suddenly we have nine vertically
now. and then if we're going to divide

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.420
one way we'd better divide the other way by three
so that we're doing the same thing

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.790
both ways and that's a common thing in
algebra is you're doing the same thing

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.909
to both sides of an equation. that's
what we're doing by dividing the screen

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.409
the same both ways. So now if we look at
the Red we have 12 along this way but

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.650
still nine this way so that's fine but
the ratio of this screen is still 4:3. So

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.129
how do we get it to 16:9? Well. we have
12:9 red squares. we need to extend the

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:12.850
red out

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.800
by two on either side don't we. so we have 12.
13. 14 and then on the right hand side we

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.790
have 15. 16. so now this new screen has a
ratio of 16 to 9 which is a different

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.180
ratio to 4:3. OK so just before I give you a
quick challeng I want to show you another

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.640
trick which helps understanding how to
do ratio maths a little bit easier. which

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.170
is that if I said to you well

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.190
scale 11 by 4:3 in the ratio 4:3
and it's always like do I multiply by 4 and divide by 3

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.290
or the other way round well just think
do you want it to get bigger or smaller?

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.590
If you want it to get smaller then multiply by
three and divide by 4. and if you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.620
want it to get bigger then multiply by
4 - the bigger thing - and divide by

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.230
3. So that's a pretty easy way of
saying look if I want to put something

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.870
through a ratio - change something by a
ratio - then just think to yourself do

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.400
I need the thing to get bigger or smaller. if I
say another awkward number like

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.340
seventeen and I want you to make it bigger in
the ratio 16 : 9 well then

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.760
multiply it by the bigger number and
divide it by the smaller number. OK if you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.840
want to get smaller in the ratio of 16
to 9 then multiply it by the smaller number

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.340
and divide by the bigger number.
Hopefully that makes sense and that's

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.290
quite a useful rule of thumb. it's certainly
the way I think about scaling things

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.210
through a ratio. Fantastic I have a quick
simple challenge for you. I want you to calculate

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.390
the screen for me. if a 16:9 screen is four
centimetres high. how wide is it? show

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.670
your reasoning in the discussions. Just
waiting for me to show you are you?

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.150
OK. welcome back so it's pretty simple you've
got a 16:9 screen. it's four centimetres

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.370
high. how wide is it? Well I like to write
the units in.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.910
so four centimetres. Now is it getting
bigger or smaller? Just draw yourself a

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.400
sketch if you're not sure. It's a 16:9 screen. it's
four centimeters high. The width is going to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.610
be bigger than the height right so we
multiply by 16 it doesn't have any units

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.500
and divide by nine and then you just
have to do that calculation which is

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.160
sixty-four over nine which is and that's
when we just grab a calculator... 16

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.550
sorry 64 / 9 is 7.1 Now how many significant
figures do quote this to? Well we only

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.220
started by telling you it was a four
centimeters wide screen so really seven

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.340
centimeters is good enough I'd let you
get away with 7.1 but any more than that and

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.470
you're giving me more information back
than I gave you. I only said it was four

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.500
centimeters wide so seven is good enough.
Learn to be easy on the decimal places

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.750
or significant figures. So up here in
the top right of this is your solution

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.540
to your challenge. about seven
centimetres wide and congratulations if you

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.020
got that right I'll see you in the next
where we'll be setting up world space UI

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.760
canvas.
