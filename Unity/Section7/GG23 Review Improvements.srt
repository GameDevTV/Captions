00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,320
Hey guys, so as a final video in this
part of the section we're gonna just

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,920
tidy up a few things. So firstly I'm
going to read the music on load and

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,410
improve the win and lose screens; so why
do we need to read music on load? Well

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,570
let's see what happens right now - plays our
startup sound , goes over to the options

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,380
screen but this volume is not what we've
set it. So say I've set the volume very

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,649
quiet, if I stop playing the game and
play again I want that initial volume to

00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:39,949
be fixed

00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,559
not change with the options but listen
it's loud now. You may not be able to hear clearly

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,229
but as soon as I click options it
goes down to whatever this value is. So

00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:53,799
what I want to happen is I want to read
the value that's set in the player prefs

00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,100
at the moment we get to the start scene
so let's just get on with it now. So a

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,670
valid way of doing this is to create an
empty game object on the Start scene

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,240
called scripts and this is purely to
hang scripts that are going to run on this

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,230
scene off, I like to put it at the top and
have a neutral transform on it. So then we

00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,640
could make ourself a new script for this,
which would be fine, and which should be

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,180
just set start volume for instance. OK so
we have a set start volume script, let's

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,730
just tidy it away into the scripts
folder and take a look at it. You're not

00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,350
gonna get away quite that easily at this
stage in the course, why don't you do it?

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,590
Come on, you can do it we have a
persistent music manager so it doesn't

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,880
actually exist in this scene right now
only when we start from the splash

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,970
screen so you're gonna need to find the music
manager, and then you gonna need to call

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,510
it with the options from the player
prefs. Remember the player prefs' a static

00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,870
so you don't need to find them or do
anything clever, you can just call

00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,450
directly on the player prefs manager.
Have a go at it, see if you can make the

00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,780
start scene obey the volume level in
options.

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,590
Cool, welcome back. So we're going to need a
private music manager, why private? Well

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,840
because we're gonna find it inside here
we're not gonna be dragging it across in

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,069
the inspector there he is, so on the start
we to find it, how we gonna do that?

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:27,310
So we're going to game object dot
find object of type music manager and

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,750
it's a method; now what's going to be
that? It's gonna be the music manager now

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,300
I always like here just to check we've got it.

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:45,730
debug dot log found plus... found music
manager and then just a add on the end

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,269
log out the actual manager; let's just
make sure that works, firstly it

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,819
shouldn't work from the start scene
because there is no music manager in the

00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:08,160
start scene, let's try. Well it's saying found music manager but there's no object on the end of that sentence and

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,019
that's as we expected so it's saying
debug dot log found Music Manager,

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,489
if you want it to not even logged out you
just say if music manager and then if

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,209
there is no music manager then that log will not
be called; we could actually deal

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:32,790
with its exception right now, so else
debug dot log warning I think it's a

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:40,790
warning if we're not setting the
volume, no music manager found on start

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:50,319
scene - or in start scene so can't set volume. OK?

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,349
and then we close our brackets, let's try
that. First without the music manager. What

00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,680
does the console say? No music manager found
in scene so can't set volume. Fine, good

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,010
now let's run it from the splash screen,
keep an eye on the console it's making

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,310
the persistent music player which
arrives in the start scene and that's

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,739
fine. It's

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,180
found persistent music manager music
manager so it's actually found it in this

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,880
case and where is it? There it is, persistent
music. Great, so that's one part of it

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,210
done and we've caught the case where it
doesn't happen then what do we need to

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,090
do well on start if we have found a
music manager I don't think we need to

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,199
log it any more, now that we know that
it works, we'll just log the exception, all we

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,070
need to do is go ahead and set that
music so it's music manager

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,349
Well we first need to get the volume, so
float volume equals player prefs manager

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:50,930
dot get master volume and it's a method.
Fine, and then we just need to say music

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:59,919
manager . now where is it... set volume volume. You see that?

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,650
Relatively simple? OK let's play and
make sure it works properly so starting

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,380
from the splash screen

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:17,700
Go into my options, set the volume very very
very quiet, come out to make sure it's

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,360
saved and stop playing the game. Now let's
try again, we have a loud splash screen we should have

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:31,360
a very quiet start scene. We do, just try it at the
other end, it's very loud, back to save, stop

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,070
playing, play from the splash screen. Splash
screen comes in and now it's playing at

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,620
full volume. Perfect, so let's just recap
the code, make sure you're clear on

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,800
how we've done that, so we use a private
music manager because we're gonna find

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,660
the music manager and we do not want it
exposed in the editor. We go ahead and

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,210
find it right here, if it exists we read
the player prefs using this static

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,220
method which we can call anywhere public
static remember we can do that from

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,370
anywhere which is very useful, we have our
own player prefs interface which was

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,520
created which is pretty handy and then
we go ahead and just set the volume on

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,800
that music manager instance that we
found and if we couldn't find one we

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,200
log a warning. Cool, on to the next tidy up task
then quickly. So the next thing is catch the

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,720
first-order error with auto load level
after. What the hell does that mean? Well let's

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,630
just take a quick look at it, thank you
to the people in the discussions for

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,180
bringing this up so on our splash screen, on
the level manager, we have this autoload

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,610
next level and then it says three so the
question is what happens if somebody puts a

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,060
negative value in? Well let's just catch
that, there are lots of ways we could

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,030
deal with it but let's... I'm going to make
this as simple as possible and I'm just

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:51,760
gonna say... hang on a second, I had a little crash of mono there so just let it reload, come back to life...

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:58,970
here it is, and it's the level manager I
want. OK so if the autoload level

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,520
next level after is less than or equal
to 0, I'm going to say... I'm just gonna

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,780
change it to less than or equal... level
load autoload disabled, use a positive

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:14,770
number in seconds. Now you could rename
this whole thing auto load next level

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,400
after seconds, thanks Marco for the
suggestion, that would be even longer... my

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,880
challenge with that is it's so long it
doesn't really fit

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,660
over here in the inspector so you're
probably gonna miss it anyway unless you've

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,510
expanded it out. Already with the word after
it's kind of too long so we just leave

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,500
it like this now if somebody tries to put
a negative value in they'll get a

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,040
log rather than an error or a warning just
a log entry, because they may want auto

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,610
load disabled, so that's a very minor tweak
but valid points there from everybody.

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:52,820
Thank you for that... OK, alternative fade without coding,
thanks to Ryan for this one so when we

00:07:52,820 --> 00:08:00,090
get to the start scene we fade in with
this fade panel entity here and we have

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,270
a script on it, a fade in script which is
fine and let's just have a quick look at that

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,440
fade in script. It's relatively simple but
it does a few things, it has to find

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,350
components and mess around, how about doing
it with the animator? That's a good idea from

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,180
Ryan that's perfectly valid, so let's
disable the script so now when you run

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,860
the Start menu it will not fade in, it'll
just sit there, it's actually got a murky panel

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,340
hanging on it right now. So let's look
how we'd do it now that you're clear with

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:32,479
the animator. You add an animator, let's
create a animation controller and let's

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,440
call it fade. Just simply fade. Let's
attach the fade animation controller to

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,390
it - by the way I think you can do this
yourself so I would encourage you to try

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,910
stopping and doing a fade in on your own,
if not just continue to watch me and I shall

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,910
show you had to do it, so there's the
fade, there's the fade animation, let's just

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,440
take a look at it then. If we go over to the
animation what have we got? We don't have

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,840
a curve yet, we need one so fade in.
There's the fade in animation there, great

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,150
so we're gonna fade in over how long?
Well two seconds is what we had before in

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,930
the script, so let's go for two seconds.
So what we do is we had a keyframe, well

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,410
first we need to decide on the curve. The
curve is going to operate on the image

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:19,250
color, that's what you need: the image
color. OK? Great so we drag the keyframe

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,810
out to 2 seconds,

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,710
so in the beginning we set the color at
zero time we want 255 we want a

00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,180
fully opaque black box and then at two
seconds over here, we want to set the

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,270
color keyframe down to 0s, so a fully
transparent black box. Nearly there,

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,760
the only problem with this at the moment
is it will fade just fine even though the

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,060
script's disabled but it's going to keep
fading in loops, so the way we change

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,110
that if we go here to the fade in
animation and turn off looping. Great, the

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,589
second thing that's going to go wrong is
we're not going to be able to click because we've

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,710
got a panel sitting over the top so we
need to disable the panel in the

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,220
animation you can also do that you go to
this image and you choose the Enabled

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,870
property it's enabled on the first
keyframe but it is disabled

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,940
towards the end, actually at the end. Now you
might say how about if we want to be able to

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,350
click before the fade is finished, well
you could try that but when the panel

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:18,410
disappears you get a sharp bang, you see that
bang in color? So you are going to

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,290
need to do it at the end there unless we get
more elaborate which we don't need to. So

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,150
that's it, you have an animation sitting
on the fade panel that has a color and a

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,470
fade like that, perfectly valid. In fact
it's so valid that I am going to leave it

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,030
like that, I will leave the fade script
disabled and just use the fade animation

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,810
so we have two options, alright and there
it goes; and of course you could get a

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,630
lot more customisation over it this way
if you wanted to. So thank you for that Ryan

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,560
let's look at the next tweak.

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,350
Pretty much there we just need to save
our scene that we worked on so hard

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:59,700
and make sure we prefab everything so if
we go to level one here then we've got a

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,600
lot of stuff in this scene right let's
just zoom to the level canvas, all

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,620
these guys here are fine, we want
everything prefabbed. So the camera is

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,750
already prefabbed, you can see it from the
inspector, the level canvas is preffabbed,

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,120
what we want to do is start prefabbing
the attackers and defenders, we've done

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,660
a lot of work on them so I'm actually gonna
create a subfolder of prefabs called

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,480
attackers and it's literally just a
question of dragging each one into there

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,420
so they go blue and any changes we make
to the attackers on this level

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,160
reflect over on any future level that we
create using prefabs so create another folder

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,100
for defenders inside your prefabs and
then take each of your defenders and

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:48,230
prefab them by dragging one at a time...
gnome, cactus, gravestone, star trophy perfect

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:54,770
now the final thing I would like to do
here is go to level two and just look at

00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,090
the differences between that and level
one, well we have a game camera which is fine,

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,770
we have a level 1, level canvas 1 in level 2,
what's that all about?

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,410
So I'm gonna confidently delete my level
canvas 1 and bring in my prefabbed level

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:16,570
canvas cos it should just work; what else
do we need from level 1, I want to make sure the

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,220
attackers and defenders... Ok so let's try
it without necessarily putting them in any

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,380
folders, let's drop a fox in and let's drop
a lizard in, great and let's just check they

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,930
animate and of course they do because
they're all prefabbed. Great, so we don't need

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,050
to go any further with level 1 and level 2
at the moment, we've proved that prefabbing

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,540
works, so pretty happy, that's all good
and that's the end of this section;  if

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,340
you look back to see... this part of the
section sorry... if you look back to level one

00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,040
you'll see that basically we have all
the animation we want, the main job now

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,320
is to script all the types of behaviours we want,
and that's going to be the subject of

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,840
the next part of this section. See you soon.
