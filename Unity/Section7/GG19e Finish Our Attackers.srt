
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700


2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,700
OK, so I'm going to go to the Animation's part of my

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,700
Assets and just take stock. So I have a Cactus. I'm just going to rename these

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,700
clips cactus attack, just so that we have

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,700
unique clip names. OK, so that's the Cactus

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,700
done! OK, we're not bothering to animate the projectiles yet.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,700
The Fox, so Fox next! Let's just do it! When you get to it, don't double handle

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,700
things, right. You've just arrived at the Fox, do the Fox right now. So

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,700
it is an Attacker. Create Empty Child, call it Fox.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,700
Now, I'm going to do things a slightly different way. Let's create another

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,700
empty child of the Fox. Let's call it Body, and then,

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,700
on the Body let's put the Sprite Renderer. I'm going to go and

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,700
get a, what shall we have, a walking sprite as the default.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,700
That's good! Now where is my Fox in the world?

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,700
Well let's zoom out, there he is! Let's just move him to

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,700
somewhere on grid, say here. We have

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,700
him precisely on grid 5, 4. You might be wondering what's going to be different,

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,700
not a lot, just the order that I add the controllers and things in. Moving the

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,700
Body sub-component. Remember scaling the Body subcomponent. Just

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,700
doing this by eye, so that your Fox is at grid, your Body isn't.

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,700
OK, that's pretty cool! So what am I going to want to do

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
now? I'm going to want to add an animation to the Fox. What happens if I select the Fox

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Body and then just add an animation clip straight off? Let's

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
see what happens OK. Fox walk, let's call

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,700
it. Now, it's added to clip, but unfortunately it's added an

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Animator to the Fox Body, so it's not a good place to have it. So

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,700
this is why I tend to specifically make the Animator

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,700
on the parent first, then

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,700
go to the trouble of making myself an Animator. You see it's even

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,700
called the Animator, Body, it's all wrong, so this is why I've been doing it the slow way.

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Now, I know that if you add a curve to the Body, it will create an Animator

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Controller for you and stuff, but it does all the naming wrong, so let's just do it manually,

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,700
it doesn't take long. Create an Animator Controller, call it _Fox.

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,700


35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,700
May need a capital, just to go with the name of the Fox. It doesn't

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,700
really matter. OK, let's pop it into the Controller

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,700
slot, and that's good! Down to the Body, now

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,700
we have a default sprite. So he's looking good! Now, we can add

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,700
a clip at last. By the way, the difference between a curve

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,700
and a clip is, the first time it does the same thing. The second time, it'll add a second curve to the

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,700
same clip, which means that you can control multiple things at once, maybe the X and the Y movement

42
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,700
independently. But in this case, it doesn't really matter, so this is fox walk.

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,700
Because we're going to start off by walking in, we're replacing

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,700
that clip. That's fine! We're going to work on the Sprite Renderer

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,700
of the Fox. There it is! We're going to leave the zoom out to

46
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
see the default frames, leave them there for the moment. Go grab all the walking frames,

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,700
which really is getting the same, but I want to show you step by step.

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,700
Previously in the course I did this as a sped up video, but I got a lot of kickback that it was very

49
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,700
hard to follow, so I'm doing it frame by frame and step by step now. So

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,700
fox walk. Let's have a look! There he is walking away,

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,700
bless him. Cool! Quite fun! Walking a bit quick, I would

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,700
say. Let's slow down the samples to 30, let's see what that looks like.

53
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Yeah, that's a bit more like it!

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,700
Yeah, he's walking kind of smoothly. O.K., that's fine! So the Fox is

55
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,700
walking. Let's think about the next clip, not curve. Adding a curve here would allow

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,700
you to change something else, as well as the sprite, but we're adding a new clip.

57
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Fox jump,

58
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,700
there's the state. How long is it going to be before it transitions? Well

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,700
let's have a look. The walk went 30 frames a second, and we've got

60
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,700
just over 20 frames here, so it would need to

61
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,700
be about 3 and 1/2, something like that

62
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,700
cycles, so let's try 3 and 1/2, it's close enough.

63
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,700
After 3.... Oops, not 35 [Laughs] we'll be there forever. After 3 1/2

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,700
cycles, let's test what we've just done. 1,000, 2,000,

65
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,700
3,000 then it moves! That's good! So the Fox was walking for about

66
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,700
the right amount of time. Let's go over to his jumping animation.

67
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Add a Curve to the Body, Sprite Renderer.

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Perfect! Let's go find the jumping frames.

69
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,700
Here they are. Cool, look how high he jumps. Drop them in, delete

70
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,700
the defaults. I drop them in before deleting the defaults, so we don't lose the whole

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,700
curve line. OK, we better use 30 frames a second to be consistent

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,700
with the walking, before we even look at how long this should last.

73
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,700
And it's got about 30 frames, so it's going to be about 3

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,700
loops, before we transition to the next state but let's just check. 1,000,

75
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,700
2,000, 3,000, then he starts jumping.

76
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Cool! And he's going to stay in there forever,

77
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,700
because we haven't got a state for him to go to. What's the state that he's going to go to?

78
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Well it's going to be attacking, isn't it. So let's add a new state. Clip adds a state,

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,700
if you remember, as well.

80
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Fox attack, make a transition from the jump

81
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,700
to the attack. We need about 3 cycles, we decided,

82
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,700
and let's go sort out the attack state, so click on attack.

83
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Add yourself

84
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,700
a curve, which is the Body, Sprite Renderer.

85
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Go find your frames. Here they are, boom in

86
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,700
they go! Delete the defaults. Oops!

87
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,700
If you make a mistake, Control Z, and

88
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,700
move it across. Now, 30 frames a second, let's be consistent. How long does this last?

89
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Well it's about 20, so we need to go about 3 1/2 cycles again.

90
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,700
So fox attack back to walk is about 3 and

91
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,700
1/2 cycles. I'm just doing rough mental calculations here.

92
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Let's just check it all works. Go back to the scene. 2,000,

93
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,700
3,000 starts jumping. 2,000,

94
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,700
3,000 attacking! Nearly there but attacking unfortunately is

95
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
something wrong with that. What's wrong with attacking? Did I put the wrong frames in? I think I

96
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,700
may have done that, let's have a look. Let's watch him

97
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,700
attacking. Maybe it's just subtle, maybe he just like chews and you can hardly see it?

98
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,700
Nah, that's too subtle for me. [laughs], So let's

99
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,700
delete all the fox attack frames.

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Jump, walk... Yes I did, look I needed this attack

101
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,700
one here. You may have wondered what I was doing at the time. Now, how would I do

102
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,700
that? I need to go and add the curve again. So that's fine, that sort of thing

103
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,700
happens. Just suck it up and say, no problem I'll just do it again.

104
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,700
It's really not worth getting yourself stressed over those things. It's just not worth

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,700
the shortening of your life. So I'm holding down Shift

106
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,700
to select those two, move it all across, 30 frames a second. Observe

107
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,700
that this guy is about 20 frames long now, so we need...

108
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Well let's do a calculation this time. It's 20 frames

109
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,700
long, so it's 20 divided by 30, which is 0.6667.

110
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,700
What would we need... So I'm going to add that to my memory. If

111
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,700
I want 3 seconds divided by memory recall, we have 4.5.

112
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,700
So 4.5 transitions we need to

113
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,700
do in the animation. I have to go back here. Not 3.5 but 4.5.

114
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,700
Let's just check! Scene view, 2,000,

115
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,700
3,000. 1,000, 2,000, 3,000,

116
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,700
and attacking! Cool, our Fox is groovy!

117
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,700
So let's go back to where we were! If you remember the tree that we were going through, when

118
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,700
we were looking down here. The Fox is looking good! The Gnome, how's the Gnome?

119
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,700
He's named well, gnome hop, gnome idle. That's all good! The Gravestone, gravestone

120
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,700
attack, gravestone idle. Cool! Lizard, lizard appearing. Oh, well it ought to be lizard appearing

121
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,700
hey! So let's just make that unique, lizard appearing clip name,

122
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,700
lizard attacking,

123
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,700
and lizard walking.

124
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Wicked! OK, that's good! So projectiles we're going to worry about later,

125
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,700
and the Star Trophy, we're going to worry about later. We have finished our Attackers.

126
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Awesome job guys!

127
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
So we're pretty much there. Now I, this is

128
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,700
the patch to the video, this has been applied 9 months after the course was originally

129
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,700
made, and some of the things I've just done will be slightly different to what

130
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,700
you see in the next video. For a start, in the next video, these things will be laid out on the screen

131
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,700
differently. Now I could painstakingly go through and get it all to exactly the same

132
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,700
state, but to be honest, I think the changes are going to be very minor. So in the next

133
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,433
video, don't be shocked if these things moved a little bit. Also, don't be shocked if my animation timings are a little bit different.

134
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:56,433
But if you do want to access the exact code, at the end of this video, or

135
00:08:56,433 --> 00:09:00,433
indeed at the end of any video in any of our courses, then this is exactly how you do it.

136
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:04,433
By the way, I'm going to give you all of this in a challenge slide in a minute and I'm going to ask you to

137
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:08,433
go and try it, but for now, let me just show you it through. Just watch through. Go to github.com/bentristem

138
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:12,433
If you're already a member of GitHub, follow me.

139
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:16,433
It'll be really fun! If you're not, you don't need to be signed in. In fact, I'm not signed in right here.

140
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:20,433
So then you need to go find the Complete Unity Developer Organization,

141
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:24,433
or you can go direct there using this URL, which will be on your challenge slide. You find the

142
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:28,433
section in question, which in this case is Glitch Garden. Now, a slight

143
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:32,433
complexity with Glitch Garden. In general you would click commits,

144
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:36,433
and again, this will all be in your challenge slide, step by step. And you'll be on the

145
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:40,433
Master Branch, and you'll find that these names here correspond to the

146
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:44,433
names, videos in general. But because I've just done a major patch to this section, the last

147
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:48,433
four videos have been updated many months after the event. You're going to need

148
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:52,433
to click on Branch: master and fix-animation-2. You don't have to do

149
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:56,433
any of this, by the way, but this is just how you get to our code if you want it. Now,

150
00:09:56,433 --> 00:10:00,433
once you're here you can see that March 2016, considerably

151
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,433
after February 2015, are the four videos I've just fixed. This replaces

152
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:08,433
one video. It used to be called Combining Animation Types, it was horrible! It was

153
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:12,433
sped up nearly 3 times and it was very hard to follow. Now we have 4 that are nice

154
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:16,433
and easy to follow. If you want to get to the state, at the end of this video, which is called

155
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:20,433
Finishing Our Attackers, you click on the right-hand side here, "Browse the repository at this point

156
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:24,433
in history". You don't need to be logged in. You get to here and then you

157
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:28,433
can click Download ZIP. And what you'll get is a ZIP of the entire

158
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:32,433
Glitch Garden folder. Now, that's in Unity 4.6, if you open it

159
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:36,433
in Unity 4.6 it'll be fine. Remember to save your project first. If you open it in a later

160
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:40,433
version, Unity 5 point something, it will ask to upgrade the project, which is fine,

161
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:44,433
and you can still look and see exactly how we have everything setup, if you want

162
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:48,433
to. But this in general goes, if we zoom right back out to me,

163
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:52,433
this goes for all my courses. You can see what I'm doing across all courses, over

164
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:56,433
all time. I have organizations here for all the different courses, and this is quite a cool

165
00:10:56,433 --> 00:11:00,433
place to go and see all the projects as they evolve. So thanks for watching that, and I shall see

166
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:04,233
you in the next video, where we'll pick up the project where we left off!
