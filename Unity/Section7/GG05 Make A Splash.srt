
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,680 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to start a little differently
this time by making a splash screen. On the

00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,289 align:middle line:90%
free version of Unity there's a mandatory
splash screen that comes up as you can see

00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,420 align:middle line:90%
here on the left. Now these are screen shots
from Block Breaker running on my Android device

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,980 align:middle line:90%
but the same would happen on the web and that
splash screen would stay up until the first

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,779 align:middle line:90%
screen for example the start menu has finished
loading. So what we want to do is make our

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,770 align:middle line:90%
own splash screen in between where we have
a nice big pretty image that lasts between

00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:38,059 align:middle line:90%
one and five seconds, maybe with some short
sound and then people can see that while the

00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:43,109 align:middle line:90%
start menu loads. It's also just good branding,
good practice and just looks better.

00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:49,249 align:middle line:90%
The other thing that's good about it is that
you can get away without having to check for

00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:54,280 align:middle line:90%
duplicate music players and the like if we
insert our music player on the splash screen

00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,920 align:middle line:90%
and then tell it not to destroy on load then
because we never revisit the splash screen

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,839 align:middle line:90%
we never have to check for duplicate instances
and do any of that destroying business so

00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:07,850 align:middle line:84%
this is an alternative pattern for you.

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,510 align:middle line:90%
So here are some resources for you - we've
used before Dafont.com, freesound.org, google

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,580 align:middle line:90%
images but crucially glitchthegame.com - that's
where I'm going to get all my assets from

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,890 align:middle line:84%
for this game.

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,580 align:middle line:90%
Glitch is a game that failed and they've very
kindly put all of their art into the public

00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:35,340 align:middle line:90%
domain. So from here I'm going to use this
for my start scene at 1600 by 900. So here's

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,070 align:middle line:90%
your challenge what I want you to do, I think
that you're ready for it, is to add a simple

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:46,909 align:middle line:90%
UI image to a scene called splash; add a short
sound, five seconds or less. Again you can

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:53,180 align:middle line:90%
get that from the Glitch website, there's
a couple there that work quite well.

00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,570 align:middle line:90%
Import a Start Scene from a previous project,
customise it if you like, the fonts and things

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,340 align:middle line:90%
and then arrange for the start scene to load
after one to five seconds so what we want

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,850 align:middle line:90%
is for the splash scene to come up with a
little bit of sound and then after between

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:13,879 align:middle line:90%
one and five seconds I suggest about two and
a half then the start scene will load and

00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,579 align:middle line:84%
then that's it, you're done.

00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:20,299 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about the scaling of that image
but I suggest that you use a 16:9 image.

00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:26,280 align:middle line:84%
So that's it, go ahead and enjoy the challenge.

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,120 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back so, how am I going to do this?
I've downloaded the 1600 by 900 image, I'm

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,739 align:middle line:90%
going to go quite quickly as we've scene quite
a lot of this before so I've saved the project

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,499 align:middle line:90%
as Glitch Garden now in my case I accidentally
saved it as a 3D default project - I know

00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:44,469 align:middle line:90%
that because if I go to the layout and hit
default I end up in the 3D view. It doesn't

00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:49,159 align:middle line:90%
matter, it hardly changes anything you can
always just click 2D so that's fine, Glitch

00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,859 align:middle line:90%
Garden's the project name. I'm going to save
the scene - currently the scene is not saved

00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:56,950 align:middle line:90%
so I'm just going to call it... I'm actually
going to make a folder for it you can do that

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,409 align:middle line:90%
in Finder here - underscore scenes - because
I like to tidy it into there and then I'm

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:06,569 align:middle line:90%
going to call it 00 Splash. I'm going to start
using numbers in front of my scene names just

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,129 align:middle line:84%
for simplicity.

00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:15,129 align:middle line:90%
Cool so here we have a splash scene. Insert
a UI image. Perfect. So there is our canvas

00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:19,629 align:middle line:90%
and our image. Canvas is th larger box, the
image is just a little square.

00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:26,249 align:middle line:90%
Right. Now we need to get the... Import a
new asset we need to get the image that we

00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:30,819 align:middle line:90%
found for Glitch in here. That's great so
we have an image now for me it's come in as

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:36,669 align:middle line:90%
a texture, we want it as a sprite 2D and UI.
Because that's what the UI image is expecting.

00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,189 align:middle line:90%
Perfect. I'm not going to worry about pixels
per unit because this is a screen space canvas

00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:43,279 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be using.

00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:47,269 align:middle line:90%
Cool so here it is, there's the image I'll
leave it in the root for now it doesn't matter.

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,849 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to apply my image changes, drag
the image sprite on; perfect. Now a couple

00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,900 align:middle line:90%
of things I do want to change on the image.
Well, only one actually, I want to preserve

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,059 align:middle line:90%
the aspect ratio, there you go now the image
suddenly is no longer being stretched so preserve

00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:08,449 align:middle line:90%
aspect ratio and I'm going to click set native
size - Ooh much bigger.

00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,989 align:middle line:90%
Alright, cool so now we have an image that's
much bigger than our canvas if we look over

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,209 align:middle line:90%
in the game preview, it's a bit weird but
that's OK at least we've got the full pixel

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,260 align:middle line:90%
resolution of the image. If you go back up
to the canvas now we've got a few options.

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,660 align:middle line:84%
What render mode do we want on the canvas?

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,750 align:middle line:90%
Well it's still going to be screen space overlay
it's a UI, it's a User interface and it's

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,040 align:middle line:90%
going to overlay the entire screen so we leave
that as it is.

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,680 align:middle line:90%
Skip over the rest for the moment. OK the
canvas scaler. We're going to go for scale

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,350 align:middle line:90%
with screen size. If the screen size is smaller
than 1600 by 900 we want the canvas to scale

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,150 align:middle line:90%
down and vice versa so we're going to scale
with screen size as t UI scale mode.

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,530 align:middle line:90%
The reference resolution is 1600 by 900 in
my case because that's the resolution of my

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,920 align:middle line:90%
image. Ah we're getting closer now, if we
look over in the game scene, it's starting

00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,720 align:middle line:84%
to look a bit more sensible.

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,660 align:middle line:90%
OK, now what's the screen match mode we're
going to be using here with this image? Well,

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to leave this bit until another
video because there's quite a lot to think

00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,820 align:middle line:90%
about when it comes to match modes and all
the rest of it so I'm just going to scale

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,590 align:middle line:90%
my image so it fits and stick it in the middle
of my canvas then over in the Game Scene it

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,980 align:middle line:90%
looks OK. It's kind of what we're used to.
OK let's leave it at that, we'll revisit these

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,070 align:middle line:84%
settings in a little bit.

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,020 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic, so now we need to get it loading
a start menu. Or a start scene. So firstly

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,770 align:middle line:90%
we don't have a start scene, let's go find
an appropriate start scene. I'm going to use

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,910 align:middle line:90%
the Block breaker start scene because it's
the most similar to what I want to use here.

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:45,640 align:middle line:90%
So I go to Block Breaker, I go and find Start
Menu here and I'm going to drag - just drag

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,930 align:middle line:90%
it into the project. OK if we look at it,
saving changes to Splash, what have we got

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,620 align:middle line:90%
on the Start Menu? So hitting play, it doesn't
look like we've got anything, but that's because

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,430 align:middle line:90%
if you look at the title, subtitle et cetera
you'll find, and you can see the red error

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,680 align:middle line:90%
down the bottom that there's no font on any
of the characters so this is a good time to

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,140 align:middle line:90%
choose ourselves a font. So over to daFont,
I like funny Kid, over on daFont, I found

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,550 align:middle line:90%
it by searching Kid in the search - here he
is, funny kid.

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,700 align:middle line:90%
So I've downloaded that font, what I'm going
to do is just quickly import it. Let's make

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,590 align:middle line:90%
ourselves a folder - let's be neat as we go
shall we? Fonts. Now as a quick aside, by

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,180 align:middle line:90%
the way, you don't have to structure your
folders like this. Brice showed you an alternative

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,440 align:middle line:90%
in Laser Defender which is he used entities
to group things and we may even change our

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,910 align:middle line:90%
grouping later because even though scenes,
fonts, you know images is very clear it is

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,460 align:middle line:90%
a bit of duplication with this feature that
Unity has up here which is that you can click

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,190 align:middle line:90%
towards the top right of the assets and you
can say well show me all of my scenes or show

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,770 align:middle line:90%
me all of my you know my textures or all of
my shaders or whatever. So rather than using,

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:02,520 align:middle line:90%
say texture versus sprite, I'm going to just
say images in fact it's treating the two the

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,710 align:middle line:90%
same but I'm not going to use this type search
at the moment, not until our assets get more

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,430 align:middle line:90%
complicated. I just wanted to give you that
quick aside.

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,560 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, fonts. What do I need to do I need
to import a new asset from my downloads and

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,670 align:middle line:90%
I want to call it funny kid. Cool. Now if
I apply the Funny Kid font to all four of

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,850 align:middle line:90%
those things and then double click on my start
menus so I can see it Ahh that looks a bit

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,670 align:middle line:90%
better, it's got some style to it now. In
fact, why don't we go over to Glitch and get

00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:36,140 align:middle line:90%
ourselves from the downloads something we
can use as a background for the load scene;

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,510 align:middle line:90%
what would work well?How about dark?How about
a dark style with a fox? I'm planning to use

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,430 align:middle line:84%
the fox later.

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:51,800 align:middle line:90%
Download full size fox. Glitch fox. Perfect.
Grab this fox and pop him into images. Great;

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,590 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to set this as the background
so UI image, same as before and I need to

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:05,920 align:middle line:90%
set the fox as a Sprite and then I need to
push the fox backwards in the order of things

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,670 align:middle line:90%
and I can do that by dragging it up here in
the inspector, to the top of the heirarchy,

00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:16,560 align:middle line:90%
and having dropped the Glitch fox image into
the sprite I have it in the background. Fantastic

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,770 align:middle line:90%
so again we're going to preserve the aspect
ratio and then let's get it up to the full

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,010 align:middle line:90%
size of the canvas like so again so scaling
issues we're not going to deal with in this

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,530 align:middle line:90%
video because it's going to be too much for
one... video so let's not worry about that

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,050 align:middle line:90%
for now I'm just going to move my text to
the left a little bit and left align it because

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:41,330 align:middle line:90%
right aligned is frankly a little bit ugly;
so let's just left align and centre vertically

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,529 align:middle line:90%
the text; now just kind of tweak all the components
now we'll talk about... as I say we'll talk

00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,630 align:middle line:90%
about how all this should fit on the canvas
later.

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,920 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to get it vaguely right now.
Great so we have something that looks like

00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,560 align:middle line:90%
a vaguely stylised start menu for this game.
How's that looking? Pretty cool now it says

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,380 align:middle line:90%
Block Breaker, change it straight away the
moment you see that it's called Glitch Garden

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:14,990 align:middle line:90%
in my case, call your game what you like.
It's spelt properly; and stop them pesky animals.

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,480 align:middle line:90%
If English isn't your first language, stop
them pesky animals is terrible English so

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,360 align:middle line:90%
well done if you spotted that but I don't
care.

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,110 align:middle line:90%
OK, fantastic so leave these two elements
not overlapping and stop fannying around with

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,990 align:middle line:90%
this screen for now so we have a start screen
which is the purpose of this bit. Let's now

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,200 align:middle line:90%
go back to the splash screen which is the
one we're really focusing on, let's stick

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,370 align:middle line:90%
a tiny bit of text in here, let's say Glitch
Garden; this looks incomplete so maybe just

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:50,070 align:middle line:90%
take this Glitch Garden text component, paste
it in here; centralise... the font is correct

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:57,350 align:middle line:90%
this colour is a bit weird I'll try black
on here... yeah or white. No, black. We'll

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,970 align:middle line:90%
go for black and then we don't need the word
garden because it already says. Well, sorry

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,710 align:middle line:90%
we don't need the word Glitch because it already
says it and then I'm just going to get the

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:13,610 align:middle line:90%
UI element roughly showing us the space in
the image we want it to take up. It's just

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:20,150 align:middle line:90%
as a guide line for ourself. Perfect that's
pretty good. Now, the only thing is the font

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,760 align:middle line:90%
is rendering really ugly size-wise so I need
to turn its size up and then maybe reset the

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,360 align:middle line:90%
scale here. We've inherited some weird scale
here. I want a one to one scale there we go;

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,670 align:middle line:90%
that's better now I can resize it. So they're
the sort of things you're going to have to

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:42,430 align:middle line:90%
fiddle around you're probably going to want
a one - one scale on your rect transform up

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,480 align:middle line:90%
here; and then I'm going to use a hundred
on the font size; black, Glitch Garden - perfect

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,730 align:middle line:84%
let's try this.

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,680 align:middle line:84%
Glitch Garden, nice.

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,820 align:middle line:90%
OK next thing we need - a tiny bit of sound.
Let's do that the easy way for now, let's

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,440 align:middle line:90%
not worry about music managers and things
let's just go grab from the ringtones - under

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,839 align:middle line:90%
the alerts for example you've got Game Loaded.
That sounds fine so I've downloaded it there

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:12,690 align:middle line:90%
a moment ago; let's make myself a folder called
sounds, immediately bring in the sound asset

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:20,839 align:middle line:90%
which is... what's it called die sound, game
loaded. Perfect. Make it not a 3D sound because

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,830 align:middle line:90%
it's not a 3D game and then just drag it into
the heirarchy there and then just call it

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:33,200 align:middle line:90%
Load sound. Play on awake, yup that's fine
so look, it's starting to come together. Wow

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,800 align:middle line:90%
OK now what we need to do is make this oh
hold on... game loaded didn't save. Very easy

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,910 align:middle line:90%
to do that by the way you want load sound
and then you have to hit return. Make sure

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,500 align:middle line:90%
it changes in the heirarchy. Great, so final
thing we need to do is just get a level manager

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,500 align:middle line:90%
in here; we don't have a level manager at
the moment. So make ourselves a scripts folder,

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,320 align:middle line:90%
you get the plan. Go grab yourself a level
manager from another project; I'm going to

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,610 align:middle line:90%
grab mine again from Block Breaker because
it's... I know it works alright . Not to say

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,000 align:middle line:90%
that Brice's things won't work fine it's just
that I know it and I'm familiar with it. There

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,350 align:middle line:90%
we go level manager dot cs. Let's go in there,
have a look at the level manager get rid of

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,589 align:middle line:90%
anything to do with Brick Breakable counts
that's nothing to do with this game, OK we

00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,529 align:middle line:90%
don't even need the brick destroyed method.
now we want to modify this level manager a

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:26,170 align:middle line:90%
little bit but before I modify it for this
well no, let's modify it straight away.

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:38,310 align:middle line:90%
OK so I'm going to have a float - a public
float - auto load next level after... what

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,470 align:middle line:90%
a long variable name do I get a long variable
name award here somehow and then what I'm

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,740 align:middle line:90%
going to do is I'm going to go start - void
start of course because it doesn't return

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,590 align:middle line:90%
anything and then I'm going to say Invoke,
OK and then I'm going to use the invoke method

00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:59,660 align:middle line:90%
- you can look up the docs for that - I'm
going to call load next level give it a string

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,740 align:middle line:90%
it's a bit weird; after auto-load next level
time. OK; and then what's going to happen

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,110 align:middle line:90%
is if I put a level manager into the scene
which I can - I need to make myself a game

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,810 align:middle line:90%
Object, call it level manager. Make sure you
hit return, reset the transform we want all

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,360 align:middle line:90%
our manager components at the origin, pop
it up the top and then pop a script on it.

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,870 align:middle line:90%
Great OK now look it's got auto load next
level if I put two seconds watch this. Ah...

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,860 align:middle line:90%
nearly there, it would be auto calling load
next level but look, it couldn't be loaded

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,300 align:middle line:90%
because it's not in the build settings. That
old chestnut. Build settings, splash and start,

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:45,120 align:middle line:90%
in they go, in the order we want them. I think
I'm going to rename start actually to 01A

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,370 align:middle line:90%
start because what I want to do is reflect
this diagram that I showed you a little bit

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,839 align:middle line:90%
better. All the things in the left hand column,
well splash is going to be 00, start and options

00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,520 align:middle line:90%
are going to be 01 and then we can go on from
there and worry about it after that.

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:09,250 align:middle line:90%
So 01 Start, that's fine let's try again on
the splash screen. Great, OK it just loads

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,930 align:middle line:90%
too quickly, so I'm going to make it three
seconds... cool so congratulations on getting

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:19,800 align:middle line:90%
this far, you can now click start, you have
a splash screen, a nice sound, and it goes

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,810 align:middle line:90%
across to the start menu. Awesome, we have
the start of a cool looking game. Congratulations

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,810 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see you soon.
