00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey welcome back!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So, in order to build our game to Android, which is what we're

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
going to be doing next, you're going to need Android Studio

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
installed on your machine. So,

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in this video we're going to download and install Android Studio,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
show you how to solve or at least talk about how to solve some

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
common issues, and then just check that it loads.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, the place to go to get it is developer

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
.android.com/sdk like

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
this. developer.android.com/sdk

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That's the software development kit. That will take

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you to this page here, where you'll be able to download

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Android Studio for your Mac or PC. I suggest

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
you start that downloading now. It's over 200

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Megabytes, it may as well be downloading while I continue to talk.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So, if you click into System

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Requirements, while it's downloading, you'll see that if you're on Windows

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
what you're going to need. I wouldn't worry too much about these

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
performance related requirements, because Unity

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
will be driving the studio for you.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The bit that really is important is that you need the Java Development

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Kit Version 7 installed. So,

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
you can just do a Google search for: install java

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
JDK

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
JDK. It's the Java Development Kit

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and you'll get it from Oracle, and you actually want

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Version 7, you don't want Version 8. If you use

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Version 8 then Android Studio will have problems, at the moment.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That may change in the future, but for now it needs Version 7.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, you look on Oracle's page here and then you go and

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
find Version 7, OK

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
down here, of the Java Development Kit. That's what you need.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Fantastic! So you get JDK installed

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but if you're on a Mac it's a very similar thing, but you need JDK

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
7 but you need the Java Runtime Environment

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
6. So again, you just do a search for: "download

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
java JRM.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
JRE rather, Java

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Runtime Environment. That's all confusing J

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
RE, JDK. And then, you need to make sure

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that you've got the right version of that installed.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's worth just trying

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
running Android Studio, without changing anything about

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
your Java, by the way. It may just work, so when it's

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
downloaded, you might want to try just running the Android Studio

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Install and see if it works. If you start to get errors

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
you need to work out why. I would do a Google search

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
for the error you're getting, and depending on which platform you're on

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
you're either going to have to upgrade your versions of Java

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
JDK, the Development Kit, or the Runtime Environment

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
or possibly downgrade it. If you need to

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
downgrade your version of JDK, JRE, then

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
just go on to Google and say: "uninstall

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
java pc".

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
for example, and you'll get documents like

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
this from Java itself,

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and you could do the same thing for Mac.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And again, you'll get a document where you can go in and it'll explain, for both

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
platforms, how to uninstall and then reinstall over the

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
top. So, they're the common gotchas to

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
do with the version of Java, otherwise it's pretty plain sailing.

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Once you have finished installing it, I want you to just

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
open Android Studio.

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You don't need to know anything about how Android Studio works,

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
we just need to make sure that it will open.

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
OK, and you'll get something like this, come up

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
on your screen. Fairly ugly studio I think.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
If it doesn't come up immediately like this, then

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that's fine. You may end up with some project wizards,

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and you might think, well what do I put in all  of these boxes? Don't

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
worry, just click Next, Next, Next, Finish. If you've got

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
this far, you've done it. You just want

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the Android Studio running on your machine. You can actually

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
cancel any of these builds and just quit out of it.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We just need to know that it runs. Unity

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
will be driving it for us, and we don't need to know anything about

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
how Android Studio works. Alright, we just need to get it

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
working on your machine. So, that's your

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
challenge, for this video basically, is to get it working on your machine.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I want you to download from developer.com

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
android.com/sdk Be ready to install

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
or uninstall Java, as we discussed. If you're getting errors

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for any reason, search for the exact error message. Remember, Google is

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
your friend. It'll be worth it in the end.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I won't be showing, after this, exactly how to install

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and uninstall Java on all platforms,

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
because that's very time consuming, and we've got Windows and PC

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to think about. And I'm confident that you can sort it out yourself,

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
especially with a little bit of Google-ing or maybe in the discussions,

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
against this video. So go ahead, just get Android Studio

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
running. Don't spend any time fiddling around with Android Studio,

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
because we're not going to be using it. It just needs to be there, for

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Unity to drive. Good luck and see you soon!
