1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200


2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.200
So well done getting that far! We've basically finished all of the

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.200
animation, aside from actually scripting the behavior. So

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.200
this is a great time to take a look at how this game is starting to

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.333
shape up on a target platform.

6
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.333
So I should say, if you have any trouble at all with this Unity

7
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.333
Remote app, then just watch this video, see how it's used, but it

8
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:31.933
doesn't really matter if you don't get it working, because it's not going to prevent you from progressing on this section, whatsoever.

9
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:35.933
It can be a little bit flakey sometimes, so if there are any troubles, then do

10
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.900
feel free to just watch and move on.

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.900
So at the end of the section, we're actually going to show you how to deploy to Android

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.900
and to the iOS simulator. But this is a stepping stone, it's called the

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.900
Unity Remote. In this video we're going to talk about what the Unity Remote is and why it's useful.

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.900
We're going to show you how to get it, how to use it, and talk about its

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.900
limitations. Now, in a moment, I'm going to switch to a different microphone,

16
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.900
because we're going to be using a video camera, and you're actually going to see my holding my phone. So

17
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.900
it'll be a bit more echoey, a slightly different microphone, but enjoy the video! See you soon!

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.200


19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.200
Hey guys! So in this video I want to show you how

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.200
to use the Unity Remote App, to get some idea

21
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.200
of what your app game is going to look like on a mobile device.

22
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.200
So first thing you're going to need to do is go to Project Settings and Editor.

23
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.200
And the, under Edit, Project Settings, Editor.

24
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.200
You're going to want to go over here and say Unity Remote, and I'm going to show you on Android phone

25
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.200
first, so Any Android Device. If you're changing this, then exit

26
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Unity and restart it. OK, so on my Google Nexus

27
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.200
4 Android device, these are the steps I've taken to get the Unity Remote working.

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.200
Firstly, I've installed the Unity Remote App, you can see here,

29
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.200
and that's available in the App Store as Unity Remote 4. If you

30
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.200
open that app, it'll come up as follows, in landscape mode and

31
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.200
say: "Connect this device with a USB Cable to your computer."

32
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.200
"Press PLAY in the Unity Editor to test." Now, that may just work. Try it! Click

33
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.200
Play in the Editor, and if you're lucky,

34
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.000
it'll come up like that and start working. Now, note something,

35
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the game window on your computer, depending on the size of the

36
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
current game window, is going to determine how this shows. So

37
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I've actually come into this Settings Menu and created

38
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
a ratio for Nexus 4, exactly at the Nexus 4 resolution.

39
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Had I not done that, say I go to 3:2, then it will be horribly distorted.

40
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
OK, so you need to be running the game window of the Editor in

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
exactly the screen resolution of the device, to make a fair preview. But once

42
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
it's on there, it just works. Now, it shows that it all works kind of

43
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
OK. We can win, we can Start, and we can go to Options,

44
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
once the menu has finished fading in. We may need to make

45
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
these buttons a little bit bigger and the sliders will work. OK, it's a bit slow,

46
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a bit unresponsive, and it will only mirror the resolution

47
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that is on the Editor not actually choose

48
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
exactly the right resolution. Now, if it doesn't come up, if it just sits

49
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
there saying press play, in the Unity Editor, and nothing actually happens, then

50
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.133
these are the steps I took on my Nexus 4 to get it working.

51
00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:18.133
Firstly, I enabled Developer Options. You go to your Settings of your

52
00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:22.133
device. If you haven't got Develop Options at the bottom here, then you go to About

53
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:26.133
Phone, and at the bottom, you keep clicking the Build Number

54
00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:30.133
until it comes up and says, OK you're now a developer. OK fantastic!

55
00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:34.133
So then, inside the Developer options on your

56
00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:38.133
Android, I have turned on Stay Awake, USB

57
00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:42.133
Debugging, and Allow Mock Locations, in case Unity wants to send it

58
00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:46.133
that. The other thing you may need to do is, go into your options again,

59
00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:50.133
and then, go down to Storage.

60
00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:54.133
And then, if you click the little menu button at the top-right, you can go USB

61
00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:58.133
Computer Connection. Mine is set as Camera (PTP), Point To Point.

62
00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:02.133
OK, so given all those settings, you should find that your Unity

63
00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:08.400
Remote then works when you go into it. And that is it on Android!

64
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.400
OK, so over to using Unity

65
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.400
Remote on the iPad! The first thing you're going to need to do is change

66
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.400
your Project Settings in the Editor

67
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.400
to any iOS device, and then, quit Unity

68
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.766
and reopen it, so that those settings take effect. So go ahead and do that.

69
00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:34.766
Once Unity is reopened,

70
00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:38.766
again you want to be set getting the cable plugged in, the

71
00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:42.766
USB cable. No, Siri, I don't want you right now!

72
00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:49.066
And then, we go into Unity Remote 4.

73
00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:53.066
So here's a Unity 4 Remote App running on the iPad. Click play!

74
00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:57.066
Again, you need your resolution to be set

75
00:04:57.066 --> 00:05:01.066
to the same as the iPad, the exact resolution, otherwise you're going to get

76
00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:05.066
strange results. But provided that your Thunderbolt

77
00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:09.066
or Lightning or Mac cable is plugged in, that's crucial,

78
00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:13.066
then you should find that it comes

79
00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:17.066
up on the screen of the iPad, in the same way as it did on the

80
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:21.066
Android.

81
00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:25.066
If not, check your Project Settings under Editor. Make sure you have Any iOS

82
00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:29.066
Device selected. You may need to restart Unity Remote on the device.

83
00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:33.066


84
00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:37.066
Oh, it crashed there! It's not the best experience, I have to admit, using the

85
00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:41.066
Unity Remote, but it does work and it does give you some idea of how it is going to

86
00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:45.066
be. So that's scaled, because we've not got the same ratio of the actual target device,

87
00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:49.066
but it starts

88
00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:53.066
to give you some idea of what it may be like. It's rough, the scaling

89
00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:57.066
is rough because I haven't got a high enough resolution on my computer monitor right

90
00:05:57.066 --> 00:06:01.066
now, when I'm recording, to set the exact aspect ratio. But if

91
00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:05.066
you've set the exact ratio up here and you actually create yourself a new ratio

92
00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:09.066
or you change the Build Settings to iOS and pick one of the ones from the list,

93
00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:13.066
that will be fine! The Build Settings up here, at the top of your

94
00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:17.066
screen, have no relation to this, by the way, at the moment, because you're not actually building to the

95
00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.466
target device yet.

96
00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:22.466
So as a recap then, we've looked at what Unity Remote is

97
00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:26.466
and why it's useful. You get it on the App Stores, it's called Unity Remote 4. We've talked

98
00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:30.466
about how to use it, and you've seen it's limitations. It only streams the current

99
00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:34.466
Editor window's view to your phone,

100
00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:38.466
so if that's smaller than the resolution of your phone or different to the resolution of your phone,

101
00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:42.466
then it's not a good preview. You can find out more about it at that link

102
00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:46.466
at Unity's website. So what we did to setup Unity, we went

103
00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:50.466
Edit, Project Settings, Editor. We set Unity Remote Device to iOS or Android,

104
00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:54.466
restarted Unity if we're changing it, set the game window resulution

105
00:06:54.466 --> 00:06:58.466
to that of the device, and make the window at least that large, if you've got enough screen

106
00:06:58.466 --> 00:07:02.466
space to do it. On Android we have to enable Developer Options.

107
00:07:02.466 --> 00:07:06.466
You may get away without doing any of this, on some Android devices,

108
00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:10.466
but if you need it, then you set Stay Awake, I'll change that spelling

109
00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:14.466
later, USB Debugging and Allow Mock Locations. You may

110
00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:18.466
also want to go into Settings, Storage, and USB Computer Connection

111
00:07:18.466 --> 00:07:22.466
also, to be corrected, and set the Camera (PTP) option.

112
00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:26.466
Remember these slides are going to be available for you as well, at the beginning of the section.

113
00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:30.466
On iOS, basically, you plug it and play, make sure the cable is plugged in, and restart

114
00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:34.466
everything if it doesn't work. OK cool! Congratulations!

115
00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:36.732
We'll see you soon!
