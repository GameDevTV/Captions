00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:11.299
Hey guys, so in this video I want to show you
how to use the Unity remote app to get

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.929
some idea of what you're game is
going to look like on a mobile device. So

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.820
first thing you need to do is go to
project settings and editor and then

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.300
under edit / project settings / editor
you're going to want to go over here and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.040
say unity remote and I'm gonna show you
on Android first, so any Android device.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.740
If you're changing this then exit unity
and restart it.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.510
OK so on my Google Nexus four Android
device these are the steps I've taken to get

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.490
the Unity remote working. Firstly I've
installed the Unity remote app, you can

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.040
see here and that's available in the App
Store as unity remote 4. If you open

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.430
that app it'll come up as follows in
landscape mode and say connect the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.270
device with a USB cable to your computer.
Press play in the editor to test. Now that

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.430
may just work, try it, click play in the editor 
and if you're lucky it'll come up like that and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.870
start working; now note something - the
game window on your computer

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.159
depending on the size of the current
game window is going to determine how

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.650
this shows. So I've actually come into this
settings menu and created a ratio for

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.390
Nexus 4 exactly at the Nexus 4
resolution. Had not done that, say I go to

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.190
3:2 then it will be horribly distorted. OK
so you need to be running the game

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.830
window of the editor at exactly the screen
resolution of the device to make a fair

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.930
preview but once it's on there it just
works. Now it shows that it all works kind of OK,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.180
we can win

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.550
and we can start; and we can go to options... once the
menu has finished fading in... we may need

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.830
to make these buttons a bit bigger, and the
sliders will work... OK it's a bit slow a bit

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.080
unresponsive and it will only mirror the
resolution that is on the editor not

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.320
actually choose exactly the right
resolution; now if it doesn't come up if

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.410
it just sits there saying press play in
the unity editor and nothing actually

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.340
happens then these are the steps I took
on my Nexus 4 to get it working.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.700
Firstly I enable developer options, you
go to your settings of your device if

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.000
you haven't got developer options at the
bottom here then you go to about phone

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.760
and at the bottom you keep clicking the
build number until it comes up and says

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.410
okay you're now a developer. OK, fantastic
so then inside the developer options on

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.470
your Android I have turned on stay awake,
USB debugging and allow mock locations

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.000
in case unity wants to send it that the
other thing you may need to do is go into

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.760
your options again and then go down
to storage and then if you click the little

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.230
menu button at the top right you can go
USB computer connection, mine is set as

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.620
camera ptp - point to point. OK
so given all those settings you should

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.650
find that your unity remote then works
when you go into it, and that is it on

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:11.700
Android. OK so over to using Unity remote
on the iPad. The first thing you're gonna

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.620
need to do is change your project
settings in the editor to any iOS device

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.350
and then quit unity and reopen it so
that those settings take effect, so go

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:34.040
ahead and do that. Once unity is reopen
again you want to be set

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.200
getting the cable plugged in the USB
cable no Siri, I don't want you right

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:49.350
now... and then we go into unity remote four. So here's the unity four remote app running on the iPad click

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.860
play, again you need your resolution to
be set

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.760
to the same as the iPad the exact
resolution otherwise you're gonna get

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.600
strange results but provided that your
thunderbolt, or lightning, or Mac cable is

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.410
plugged in

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.330
that's crucial then you should find it
comes up on the screen of the iPad in

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.680
the same way as it did on the Android.
If not check your project settings under

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.940
editor make sure you have any iOS device
selected - you may need to restart unity

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.300
remote on the device.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.480
Crash there. It's not the best experience, I have
to admit using the Unity remote but it

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.620
does work... and it does give you some idea of
how it is going to be. So that scale

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.410
because we've not got the same ratio
as the as the actual target device, but

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.620
it starts to give you some idea of what
it may be like. There it's rough, the scaling

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.450
is rough because I haven't got a high
enough resolution on my computer monitor

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.140
right now when I'm recording to set the
exact aspect ratio, but if you set

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.820
the exact ratio up here and you actually
create yourself a new ratio or you

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.600
change the build settings to iOs and
pick one of the ones from the list, that

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.220
will be fine the build settings up here
at the top of your screen have no

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.680
relation to this by the way at the moment
because you're not actually building to the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.479
target device yet. So as a recap then
we've looked at what Unity remote is and why it's

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.290
useful, you get it on the App Store, it's
called unity remote four. We've talked

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.200
about how to use it and you've seen its
limitations - it only streams the current

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.979
editor window's view to your phone, so if
that's smaller than the resolution of your

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.930
phone or different to the resolution
of your phone then it's not a good

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.800
preview. You can find out more about it at
that link at unity's website. So what we did

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.300
to set up unity we went edit / project
settings / editor... we set

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.360
unity remote device to iOS or Android,
restarted unity if we're changing it.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.740
Set the game window resolution to that of 
the device and make the window at least that

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.380
large if you've got enough screen space
to do it. On Android we had to enable

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.229
developer options you may get away
without doing any of this on some

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.750
Android devices but if you need it then
you set stay awake, I'll change that

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.669
spelling later... USB debugging and allow mock
locations. You may also want to go into

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.200
setting storage and USB computer
connection, also to be corrected, and set

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.539
the camera PTP option. Remember these
slides are going to be available for you

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.720
as well at the beginning the section
On iOs, basically plug-n-play, make

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.360
sure the cable's plugged in and restart
everything if it doesn't work.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.720
OK, cool. Congratulations and we'll see
you soon
