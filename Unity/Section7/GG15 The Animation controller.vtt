00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:09.420
Hey, welcome back, so just before we start
diving into the animation controller I

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.599
want to clear up any confusion that we
may have about animation clips and

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.470
states and all that type of stuff so
what we're gonna do in this video is we're gonna

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.400
cover how animators, states and motion
clips relate to each other, we're

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.970
gonna be adding multiple animation
states and clips to a single character

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.750
we're gonna talk about the options for
transitioning between those animation

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.040
states but again please only animate one
character for now because a little bit

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.080
later on I'm going to show you why we
need to actually redo our clips slightly

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.020
so only animate this one character while we
get the fundamentals. So this is the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.320
diagram that will either confuse you or
make everything very clear and hopefully

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.270
once I've gone through it it'll make it very
clear. Basically a GameObject has a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.489
single animator an animator has one or
more animation states and then an

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.610
animation state has a single animation
clip, one or more transitions and one or

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.030
more parameters. So let's just work that
through for a minute let's look at that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.110
in unity. So let's go into our lizard
animate... well start with the lizard actually

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.510
there's the lizard himself, the
GameObject. He has a single animator if

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.320
you try and add a second animator to that then you can't - you're not allowed duplicate components

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.700
right so here is the lizard animator,
it's basically down here this bottom bit

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.110
here, the animation controller
is this guy down here, right so that is

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.010
the animator or animation controller. The other
way to get to that is you click on his

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.390
lizard diagram, look it looks like a
flow chart, it is a dot controller, you double

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.119
click it opens up this so that is the
animator, or animation controller. Right,

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:47.570
now,

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.900
states. It has a single state at the
moment, it can have multiple states, there's

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.229
two ways you can add new animation states.
One way is to create state empty it won't

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.189
have any motion attached if you do that,
he won't have a motion clip if you do

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.100
that or you go to the lizard, into the
animation window and then create new clip. If

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.140
you create a clip it will create both a
new animation state down here

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.500
and it will add to that state a motion,
here's the motion, lizard appearing motion there

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.630
okay and that is the motion were
inspecting, the animation motion we're

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.910
expecting here, inspecting here; and that is an
animation clip also known as a motion

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.150
that's what that is. Let's take a look
back at the diagram, see if it's coming

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.620
clearer. So a game object has a single animator,
try and add a second component and you

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.930
get a problem. An animator can have one or more
animation states hence the diagram on the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.440
end... the diamond on the end of the
arrow, so that is relating to this bit

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.000
multiple states in here . Let's add a new
state

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.030
empty. He's going to appear and the next
thing he's going to want to do is walk so

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.390
let's just call it walking. Don't really need to sa
lizard , because it's within the lizard

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.230
animator. Or animation controller. Has no
motion yet though, and in fact if you look in

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.640
the drop-down of motion clips here
there are none, so this list of motion

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.489
clips which relate to these motions that are
available here, we have lizard appearing, it's the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.120
only motion we have available, and
they're all listed here.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.970
Alright so that, what we've done so far
then is we have added a new animation

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.230
state in the middle there to the existing
animator, or animation controller and then

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.890
there is no clip on that animation
state yet,  but an animation state can only

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.019
have one clip, so of this lizard appearing
has a single motion clip - appearing - which

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.320
is the frames that we're going to actually play,
and then an animation state can have one

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.500
or more transitions and one or more
parameters, and then you can use the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.900
parameters to help decide about your
transitions between states. What the hell

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.280
does that mean? Let's take a look, so I'm gonna
add a transition from lizard

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.630
appearing to lizard walking, like that,  and
then that transition at the moment the only

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.280
condition on which that transition can
happen is an exit time after certain

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.530
number of loops of the lizard appearing.
So if I run lizard appearing now it'd loop once and

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.280
go to walking. There is nothing in
walking, but that's what happens. if I

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.030
set exit time to two then it would go
once - well if I actually saved it would,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.239
one second,

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.819
two, it would go once, twice round the lizard
animation loop then walking. So that's

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:28.650
the exit time parameter, if you want more
control for instance from scripts then

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.460
you add your own parameters like you
could say is attacking trigger is

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.509
attacking trigger and if you add that
parameter you can have multiple

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:46.340
parameters represented in my diagram by
this line here between animation states

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.479
and parameters at the bottom, you can have multiple
parameters and multiple transitions from

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.710
a given state, so I could have another
state here and I'll call it attacking

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:03.830
and he may for instance appear and then
immediately attack or he may go from

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.130
walking to attacking so this walking
state has now multiple transitions in it.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.530
It can go from... sorry the lizard
appearing state has multiple transitions

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.080
he can go from appearing to walking ok he
has two arrows coming out of it, or he can go

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.509
from appearing to attacking. So again in
the diagram which you might find handy to

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.020
refer back to in the future, that's
represented by the fact that an

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.270
animation state along the middle line can
have one or more transitions. The final

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.919
dotted line transition conditions tells
us that another way of saying I want to

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:43.810
go from lizard appearing to attacking
is not an exit time but now I've got new

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.990
options, I have the transitions as
options - sorry the parameters as options for

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.030
the transition so is attacking trigger
we'll discuss what triggers and bools are

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.400
later it could be my exit condition.
Same here if I'm walking it could be that

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.050
if I set is attacking to true that it
goes down to attacking. So now from

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.530
script I'm gonna have access to this
thing called is attacking trigger if I

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.550
set it and whether he's walking or still
appearing he will go into attacking. That

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.319
may not be exactly what we want, it may be
that we want to finish appearing and at

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.830
least start walking before he starts
attacking so we get rid of that arrow in

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.390
that case you just go to bed transition
and delete

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.430
Don't worry about layers in the animations for
now, we got plenty to think about so far

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.180
with just transitioning between states.
OK, fantastic so then how do we get the

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.720
walking motion clip in? Well, you could
come here and say create new clip but if

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.130
you do that look what happens it will
create a new clip - let's just test it,

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.750
test clip and it's all very well but it's also
creating a new state, well we've just gone to

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.670
the effort of setting up these states
s you don't need to do it that way, you

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:58.760
can get rid of this animations state, ok
we can go back to our project animations

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.640
and you can actually write in here get
rid of that test clip, that test motion clip,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.770
because what happened is the animator, when
you said create new clip it created both

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:15.110
a animation clip i.e. the frames, and a
animation state so it can be a shortcut

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.360
if you start there but if you haven't
started there and you've already got a walking state with

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.600
no motion clip attached this is how you
make a motion clip this is the time that

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.160
you do create an animation. It's confusing
because over in the lizard you could add

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.750
an animation to the lizard but we don't
add animations directly anymore because

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.840
that's being phased out we do everything
through the much more versatile and

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.430
powerful animator. In fact the hint is
almost in these icons, there's a little red

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:46.150
play icon representing the animation or
the motion clip inside the animator,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.380
it's kind of saying the animator is a
bigger thing it has more context it's

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.900
more powerful so remember we always use
an animator... animation.... whoops... so

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.270
remember we always use an animator as
a component but over here in the assets

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.420
we can create a new animation cos this
lizard appearing is an animation so

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:12.020
create animation; you can call it lizard walking

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.280
and we might in future choose to put all
of our lizard things into a single

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.060
folder so we don't have to keep prefixing them
with with appearing walking so we could

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:27.870
just say lizard... without the lizard we could
just say walking; like that, you may even

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.460
want to put an underscore in front of your
controller so it sits at the front and then you

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.099
could put all of this in a folder once
we've got other animals. Anyway the

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:39.870
walking clip, what do we do about the
walking clip? So, here we don't have the

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.039
walking clip available at the moment, where do
we add it? You go to the animator, to

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:49.370
walking and then now you'll have, if you go to your
assets, a new walking clip. So you've gone

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.730
to your animator, down to the state you
want to the, to the motion section in the

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.790
inspector and you select your new clip.
Great, now you're gonna switch over to

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:06.709
walking. Fantastic, finally we are ready
to drag and drop our sprites in there. So

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:10.120
I don't have any sprites yet, what is a
sprite sheet? It's just an image, so I'm going

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.459
to store it in a folder called images, I'm
gonna go get my walking animation right

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:21.709
now from my Glitch PNG folder. So to the top
of the folder, looking for the deimaginatior which we're

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:27.550
just simply gonna call a lizard, walk
there he, is that's the sprite sheet and

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.060
pop it in, now these sprite sheets are very what we
call loosely packed, there's a massive gap

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.940
between these lizards and that's fine for now
but you'll see in a bit

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.390
that that will cause us actually in the long
term a bit of a problem.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.399
OK, let's assume that this sheet uses the
same size sprites, I'm going to look at

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:46.620
the sprite editor of my previous guy and
see what size these elements are rather

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.190
than calculating it again.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:55.850
251 x 186, yep I seem to remember that. So set it
to multiple, gonna set the same pixels per

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.779
world unit 133 point and just enough
threes on the end to avoid rounding errors,

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:07.459
apply, sprite editor maximize it so it
doesn't confuse you with what's on the

00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:15.589
screen it's a grid, 251 by 186 I keep -
I get so concerned I'm gonna mis-

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:18.990
remember that. OK, it seems to be right, you
can tell it's right because they kind

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.649
of all the boxes fit.

00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:25.339
Great, now if we  maximize this guy out there it is... a
lot of white space on it, lot's of

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:28.629
wasted pixels which means lots of wasted
video memory but we're not going to worry about

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:32.809
that while we're getting to know the ropes
fantastic, let's drop all the states on

00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:36.959
there again, choose the same number of
samples per second as the other clip so

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:42.670
30 for the other one, let's choose 30 for this one and now we have a walking clip, let's take a look at

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.879
have the state machine up on the
screen and the scene view and let's just

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:51.920
play you see he's only doing one load of
walking and then walking is actually

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.079
stopping; so let's just take it take a
look at walking. What's up with walking?

00:10:55.079 --> 00:11:00.079
Walking looks okay, now let's look at the
difference between these two; walking

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:06.649
attacking walking. No that's all ok, so
the difference is probably gonna be if

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:12.529
we go to the animations because of the
way we created it appearing has a loop

00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:21.350
time here and walking does not loop so just
make walking loop as well alright. so

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:26.949
now when you play yeah that's right so
it does appearing once they walking

00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:31.249
walking walking fantastic so hopefully that's given
you lots of different ways of doing it,

00:11:31.249 --> 00:11:35.519
now I'm gonna add the third state which
is going to be attacking but I'm

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:38.589
actually gonna use this talking animation
because it's the best I've got, and I'm

00:11:38.589 --> 00:11:43.529
gonna show you very briefly that there's a
problem and then we will solve the

00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:47.759
problem in the next video, alright? So
attacking, I'm going to use walking, let's

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:50.749
just go through this quickly as we've
just done it. Let's create a new animation

00:11:50.749 --> 00:12:01.499
let's call it attacking ok, I'm gonna go
to my sprite sheets gonna go and find

00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:10.339
this talk one. Now, I just noticed that this
the size of this image in my case i s

00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:16.600
3765 by 1116, the bit that's important is 3765, it's
quite big, right. It doesn't matter let's

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.889
assume we don't know and we don't care for
the moment, just bring him in, so there he

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:24.889
goes into images and

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:29.029
same sort of thing. Now this is getting
really confusing isn't it so I'm gonna

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:39.549
start calling these things appear and
then talk and then walk just so they're easy to

00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:43.869
see, now that won't change the name of the
sprites themselves, these guys will

00:12:43.869 --> 00:12:47.519
continue to have the same name as when
we unpacked them, I probably wouldn't bother to

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:50.959
rename the actual sprites, I don't think
it's worth it, though sometimes it's nice to

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:54.529
have a link back to the original image
so we can remember when we got and find it again

00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:58.379
but now these really aren't looking
like images any more, they're sprite sheets

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:01.919
they've been unpacked. I think that they
would be better now in the animations

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:07.629
folder and then actually specifically in
the lizard subfolder which we're gonna create

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:11.839
now because all of this stuff relates to
the lizard right? So we have the lizard

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:15.089
animation controller, I've put an underscore
to put it at the front, and then we have

00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:23.579
all this other stuff, and actually if we keep the names
right - appear and appearing - appearing,

00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:29.459
appearing, attacking; now you see the
discrepancy? Attacking walk and walking - let's

00:13:29.459 --> 00:13:33.699
just give them all the same name. Now
it sits really nicely, there's his controller,

00:13:33.699 --> 00:13:37.889
there's the motion which is basically just
the - all of these frames packed into a

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:42.399
motion, same with attacking, and the
final one is walking. Now what we need to

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:48.799
do with attacking is unpack this sprite
sheet, look it's only a single sprite. You got

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:55.790
the right pixels per unit now, multiple
sprite editor, same deal just gonna unpack it, do

00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:03.480
the same with your sprite. Now I'm just
gonna check

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.329
all three of my sprite sheets have the
same pixels per unit, they do that's

00:14:07.329 --> 00:14:08.279
absolutely fine

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:14.720
fantastic so that's looking really good.
So attacking, it needs to know it's

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:23.070
frames so you go to the animator again
attacking you tell it what the motion is

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:31.089
going to be, it's the attacking motion. OK now
if we go down to attacking we need to

00:14:31.089 --> 00:14:37.000
give it the frames, give the animator the
frames, lots of frames for attacking tons

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.510
and tons of frames select them all, drop them
on there, set the same frame rate.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:49.760
Fantastic collapse down if you like for
tidiness and let's try. Keeping up

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.959
the animator there so you can see now...
what's happening is walking is just

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:57.050
looping again and again and again and
we're never getting into attacking

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.490
because the transition criteria for
attacking is is attacking trigger and

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.420
that's never happening. So what we're
going to do, I'm just going to set exit time,

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:09.519
I'm gonna walk for 5 cycles and then
attack, so appear once, walk five

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:13.670
attack. Sounds like one of those robots
are used to program as a kid. What the

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.100
hell's happening there? Look at him
attacking, fuzzy as hell and then he

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:22.670
splits up into two, weird. Why the hell's he so
fuzzy? That's going to be the topic of

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.130
the next video for you.
