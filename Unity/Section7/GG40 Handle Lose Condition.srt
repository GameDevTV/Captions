WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So welcome back! As you can see.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we have no way of losing right now apart from clicking

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this button down here. Our attackers. rather. are

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
just disappearing off the left of the screen and completely

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
taking over our Garden. our life. without

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
any regard. So. we need a simple lose condition

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and handling. So. let's go ahead and do that! What we're going to do in this video

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is. number one. remove the Lose Test

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Button or the Lose Condition Button. We are going to

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
create a lose collider. setup lose triggering and

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
transition. into the next level

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or the Lose Level at least 30b lose.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and improve the Lose Screen itself. I've got a couple of gripes with it.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now look. before we go on and I start showing

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you how to do this. I would like you to consider stopping the video

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
now even and doing this entire video on your own.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
because you've done lose colliders before I

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
think you can do all of this. So. if you feel ready. stop the

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
video now. and get the whole automatic loading

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of the Lose Screen organized. If you don't

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
feel ready. keep watching and you'll have a smaller challenge midway

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
through this video. OK.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so whether or not you're still watching. I'm going to show you how I'm thinking of

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
doing it. So. here's our scene. We already have

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
something very similar. I always think. do we already have something

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in the game that we could copy. to save ourselves time? Well. we kind of

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
do. There's our shredder. you see it on the right hand side here.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It has practically everything we need. a Box Collider and

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
well a Box Collider. So. I'm going to duplicate it.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in this case. just as an example. I'm going to leave it

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
as it is and just call it a Lose Collider.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm going to give it a different script.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
so I'm going to remove that Shredder Script. because clearly it's not a shredder.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and I'm going to give it a new script

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
called Lose Collider.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I normally call my scripts the same thing as the

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
object. because it's the behavior of the object. It needs to be moved

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
across. across to the left hand side. I'm going to use the red arrow.

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because it'll take it to the right place. and I think that if they've got

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
about there we've lost right. If they

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
get that far we're done for.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Why leave it this thick? Don't have to but being

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that wide means. if they were traveling really fast. there's not chance of them

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
passing through it on a single frame. because if you do have a frame

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
here and then a frame here. then you'll never detect the lose condition.

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Cool! So. we have a Lose Collider Script! Let's take a look

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
at that Lose Collider Script.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now. it's a trigger. so the method that I need to call.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
when the lose condition actually happens. is

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
OnTriggerEnter2D. So. let's

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
just make sure that happens. and set you up with the peripheral

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
information you're going to need and then we'll set you

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
straight into the challenge. So. void OnTriggerEnter.

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Now. you have to spell

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
these properly. because you get no Autocomplete on these messages.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now. do we need to gather any information from what you're

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
colliding with? Not in this case. so I can actually leave no parameters.

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and I can prove this is working by just...

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm just going to say lose. actually.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So. I'm just going to check this works. before we

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
throw you into the challenge. Tidy up the script.

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and then. get to the lose

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
condition. Let the defenders arrive on the left hand

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
side. Make sure we get a log entry saying. lose condition.

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Then. at least we know

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that method is being called here.

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and then. I'm going to challenge you to finish this off.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So. I'm going to

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
grab this dude and help him along his way.

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If I can. if I can get to him in time. It's going to be quicker to wait. You

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
can move the transform of things. while they are actually moving.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
If you want to by the way. you could grab a lizard and drag him

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
across. Lose Collider. to my eye that Lose Collider trigger went

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
off before he hit the Lose Collider.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So. I need to just check the position of that Lose Collider.

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Maybe it didn't? Maybe that was just

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
my imagination? I'm going to assume it was my imagination

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and carry on! So. here's your challenge for this

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
video then! You need to. in the Lose Collider.cs

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
class. find the LevelManager by script would be better

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
than dragging it in. So. use a private LevelManager Level Manager.

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Then. go ahead and find it in the Start.

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Use the OnTriggerEnter2D method to detect the loss

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
condition. and then. call Level

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Manager.LoadLevel on the ("03b Lose"); level.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and make sure that it actually works. that you can actually lose the game.

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So. go ahead. pause the video. and do that

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
now!

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
How long do I wait? [Laugh] That'll do! You're back!

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Fantastic! So. let's make this guy happen! Let's get into this

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Lose Collider Script here!

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So. I said we needed LevelManager. but want to do it in

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
script. so I wire it together in script like this: private LevelManager

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
levelManager. So. it's of type LevelManager. it's called levelManager.

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
with a small l. On the Start. we go and find it.

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
This is becoming very wrote. we do this a a lot. GameObject.Find

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
ObjectOfType. Not Objects

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but Object. There's only one of them in this level. I hope there is.

99
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
There you go! It's a method. so it needs the squigglies.

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
then semicolon. Fantastic! We're not going to do anything on Update.

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
on this. So. all we're going to do here

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
is levelManager

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
.Loadlevel. And we need to

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
give it a name. Now. we need to make sure we did the name properly.

105
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I think it's ("03b_Lose"). but I'm going to go check that string

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
value. because anything that's a string is not going

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
to get changed by the Refactor Tool if we ever

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
use it. So. this is a little bit dangerous. in a way.

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
because if you decided to rename your level. the lose condition won't

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
work. So. what we might want to do is check the docs

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
for LoadLevel. and see if it's going to tell us

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
why return...

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It doesn't tell us whether it's successful or not. by return.

114
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So. if you wanted to put a catch condition in here

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
you would need to say. if there's a

116
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
level loading or write some script around this to say.

117
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
if I call ("03b Lose") and it doesn't exist. maybe I want to

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
report an error. I'm not going to bother with that for now. I'm just going to

119
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
check that 03b is the correct scene

120
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
name. But do understand that if your designer came in and

121
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
innocently changed the ("03b Lose") to something else.

122
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that this piece of script will fall over. and it's an exercise

123
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
for the reader to guard against that. if you want to.

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
by simply seeing whether the level was loaded or not.

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But I'm going to leave it at this. Let's try and see how that

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
goes. I'd like to keep this video brief. partly because I want to go to lunch and partly

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because you've had a lot of long videos lately. So. let's

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
see what happens when Mr. Fox gets to the left hand side.

129
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
They're really fast. these foxes! This game is going to be

130
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
mental compared to Plants Versus Zombies! OK.

131
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
so what's happening here is. we don't actually have a Level

132
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Manager in the scene at all. If we remind ourselves that the

133
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Splash Screen does have a Level Manager on it. it's a prefab.

134
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
you can see it's blue and it's autoloading the next

135
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
level. after three seconds. The Start Scene.

136
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
while we do not persist the LevelManager from the

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Splash Screen to the Start Scene. let's see it not persisting.

138
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
There's the Splash Screen with it's LevelManager! We end up in Start.

139
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and there is no LevelManager in here and yet we can change level. How come?

140
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The reason we can change level in this scene is.

141
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
if we look at it. the UI buttons that do all the level

142
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
changing. like the Play Game Button is

143
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
connected to the LevelManager Prefab. You see it there?

144
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
If we click that little Explore Icon.

145
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
under the OnClick event of the button. you see it's

146
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
connected to the LevelManager Prefab. so the prefab is always available.

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So. what we haven't done yet. simply because we haven't

148
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
needed to. is in our level 2 here in our actual

149
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
level. or level 1 rather. there is no LevelManager Prefab.

150
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
We need to drop it in and that's fine. because we're likely

151
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to need to drop all of these things in. when we create a new level.

152
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So. give yourself a LevelManager. that's going to help!

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Not autoloading on the next level. and now. when

154
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
we look for a LevelManager. in this scene. it should exist. Let's

155
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
see what happens! Here you go. the Console is logging Level

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Manager (LevelManager).

157
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's telling us that Level Autoload is disabled. Good!

158
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And the game wouldn't be much fun. if we were autoloading.

159
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And now. the enemies come in. and I'm confident that now

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
that we've found the LevelManager. that we will actually get

161
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the behavior that we want. Please

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I want to go for lunch!

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
There he goes. you lose! Fantastic!

164
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So. the final thing to do here is. I just don't like the look of that

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Lose Scene. The only thing that jars me on it

166
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
is that the Start and the Quit is...

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Firstly. I don't want to say Start. I think I want to say Start Again.

168
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
which means I need to use the UI Tool to make

169
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
my text a little wider.

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
There we go! And then. I want it to just be lower.

171
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And I will just say

172
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Lose! You Moose is crazy! A bit of

173
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
fur for a while. wasn't it? But "You Lose!"

174
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
OK. so "You Lose!". "Start Again".

175
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and "Quit". nice and clear. Fine. I've made all the changes

176
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I need to make. so hopefully you managed to do this whole

177
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
video on your own! It's relatively simple. Just as a quick

178
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
recap. all we did here is we

179
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
didn't touch the LevelManager. actually. We didn't change the LevelManager at all.

180
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
we just went and found it in the LoseCollider.

181
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
well made space for it. I declared it at the top.

182
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
found it in the Start. I don't need to print it anymore.

183
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and then we simply call loadlevel  on (03b)

184
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
lose. nice and simple. So congratulations

185
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.733
and I shall see you soon!

=======

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So welcome back! As you can see,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we have no way of losing right now apart from clicking

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
this button down here. Our attackers, rather, are

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
just disappearing off the left of the screen and completely

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
taking over our Garden, our life, without

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
any regard. So, we need a simple lose condition

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and handling. So, let's go ahead and do that! What we're going to do in this video

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
is, number one, remove the Lose Test

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Button or the Lose Condition Button. We are going to

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
create a lose collider, setup lose triggering and

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
transition, into the next level

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
or the Lose Level at least 30b lose,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and improve the Lose Screen itself. I've got a couple of gripes with it.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now look, before we go on and I start showing

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you how to do this, I would like you to consider stopping the video

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
now even and doing this entire video on your own,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
because you've done lose colliders before I

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
think you can do all of this. So, if you feel ready, stop the

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
video now, and get the whole automatic loading

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
of the Lose Screen organized. If you don't

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
feel ready, keep watching and you'll have a smaller challenge midway

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
through this video. OK,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
so whether or not you're still watching, I'm going to show you how I'm thinking of

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
doing it. So, here's our scene. We already have

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
something very similar. I always think, do we already have something

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in the game that we could copy, to save ourselves time? Well, we kind of

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
do. There's our shredder, you see it on the right hand side here.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It has practically everything we need, a Box Collider and

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
well a Box Collider. So, I'm going to duplicate it,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
in this case, just as an example. I'm going to leave it

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
as it is and just call it a Lose Collider.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm going to give it a different script,

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so I'm going to remove that Shredder Script, because clearly it's not a shredder,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and I'm going to give it a new script

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
called Lose Collider.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I normally call my scripts the same thing as the

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
object, because it's the behavior of the object. It needs to be moved

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
across, across to the left hand side. I'm going to use the red arrow,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
because it'll take it to the right place, and I think that if they've got

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
about there we've lost right. If they

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
get that far we're done for.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why leave it this thick? Don't have to but being

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that wide means, if they were traveling really fast, there's not chance of them

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
passing through it on a single frame, because if you do have a frame

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
here and then a frame here, then you'll never detect the lose condition.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Cool! So, we have a Lose Collider Script! Let's take a look

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
at that Lose Collider Script.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, it's a trigger, so the method that I need to call,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
when the lose condition actually happens, is

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OnTriggerEnter2D. So, let's

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
just make sure that happens, and set you up with the peripheral

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
information you're going to need and then we'll set you

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
straight into the challenge. So, void OnTriggerEnter.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now, you have to spell

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
these properly, because you get no Autocomplete on these messages.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now, do we need to gather any information from what you're

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
colliding with? Not in this case, so I can actually leave no parameters,

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and I can prove this is working by just...

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm just going to say lose, actually.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So, I'm just going to check this works, before we

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
throw you into the challenge. Tidy up the script,

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and then, get to the lose

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
condition. Let the defenders arrive on the left hand

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
side. Make sure we get a log entry saying, lose condition.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Then, at least we know

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
that method is being called here,

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and then, I'm going to challenge you to finish this off.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, I'm going to

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
grab this dude and help him along his way.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If I can, if I can get to him in time. It's going to be quicker to wait. You

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
can move the transform of things, while they are actually moving.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you want to by the way, you could grab a lizard and drag him

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
across. Lose Collider, to my eye that Lose Collider trigger went

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
off before he hit the Lose Collider.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, I need to just check the position of that Lose Collider.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Maybe it didn't? Maybe that was just

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
my imagination? I'm going to assume it was my imagination

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and carry on! So, here's your challenge for this

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
video then! You need to, in the Lose Collider.cs

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
class, find the LevelManager by script would be better

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
than dragging it in. So, use a private LevelManager Level Manager.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then, go ahead and find it in the Start.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Use the OnTriggerEnter2D method to detect the loss

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
condition, and then, call Level

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Manager.LoadLevel on the ("03b Lose"); level,

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and make sure that it actually works, that you can actually lose the game.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, go ahead, pause the video, and do that

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
now!

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How long do I wait? [Laugh] That'll do! You're back!

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Fantastic! So, let's make this guy happen! Let's get into this

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Lose Collider Script here!

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, I said we needed LevelManager, but want to do it in

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
script, so I wire it together in script like this: private LevelManager

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
levelManager. So, it's of type LevelManager, it's called levelManager,

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
with a small l. On the Start, we go and find it.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is becoming very wrote, we do this a a lot. GameObject.Find

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
ObjectOfType. Not Objects

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
but Object. There's only one of them in this level, I hope there is.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There you go! It's a method, so it needs the squigglies,

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
then semicolon. Fantastic! We're not going to do anything on Update,

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
on this. So, all we're going to do here

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
is levelManager

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
.Loadlevel. And we need to

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
give it a name. Now, we need to make sure we did the name properly.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think it's ("03b_Lose"), but I'm going to go check that string

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
value, because anything that's a string is not going

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to get changed by the Refactor Tool if we ever

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
use it. So, this is a little bit dangerous, in a way,

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
because if you decided to rename your level, the lose condition won't

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
work. So, what we might want to do is check the docs

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
for LoadLevel, and see if it's going to tell us

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
why return...

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It doesn't tell us whether it's successful or not, by return.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, if you wanted to put a catch condition in here

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you would need to say, if there's a

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
level loading or write some script around this to say,

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
if I call ("03b Lose") and it doesn't exist, maybe I want to

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
report an error. I'm not going to bother with that for now, I'm just going to

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
check that 03b is the correct scene

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
name. But do understand that if your designer came in and

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
innocently changed the ("03b Lose") to something else,

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that this piece of script will fall over, and it's an exercise

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
for the reader to guard against that, if you want to,

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
by simply seeing whether the level was loaded or not.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But I'm going to leave it at this. Let's try and see how that

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
goes. I'd like to keep this video brief, partly because I want to go to lunch and partly

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
because you've had a lot of long videos lately. So, let's

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
see what happens when Mr. Fox gets to the left hand side.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They're really fast, these foxes! This game is going to be

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
mental compared to Plants Versus Zombies! OK,

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
so what's happening here is, we don't actually have a Level

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Manager in the scene at all. If we remind ourselves that the

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Splash Screen does have a Level Manager on it, it's a prefab,

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you can see it's blue and it's autoloading the next

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
level, after three seconds. The Start Scene,

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
while we do not persist the LevelManager from the

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Splash Screen to the Start Scene, let's see it not persisting.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There's the Splash Screen with it's LevelManager! We end up in Start,

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and there is no LevelManager in here and yet we can change level. How come?

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The reason we can change level in this scene is,

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
if we look at it, the UI buttons that do all the level

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
changing, like the Play Game Button is

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
connected to the LevelManager Prefab. You see it there?

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If we click that little Explore Icon,

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
under the OnClick event of the button, you see it's

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
connected to the LevelManager Prefab, so the prefab is always available.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So, what we haven't done yet, simply because we haven't

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
needed to, is in our level 2 here in our actual

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
level, or level 1 rather, there is no LevelManager Prefab.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We need to drop it in and that's fine, because we're likely

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
to need to drop all of these things in, when we create a new level.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, give yourself a LevelManager, that's going to help!

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Not autoloading on the next level, and now, when

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
we look for a LevelManager, in this scene, it should exist. Let's

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
see what happens! Here you go, the Console is logging Level

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Manager (LevelManager).

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's telling us that Level Autoload is disabled. Good!

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And the game wouldn't be much fun, if we were autoloading.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And now, the enemies come in, and I'm confident that now

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
that we've found the LevelManager, that we will actually get

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the behavior that we want. Please

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I want to go for lunch!

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There he goes, you lose! Fantastic!

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So, the final thing to do here is, I just don't like the look of that

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Lose Scene. The only thing that jars me on it

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
is that the Start and the Quit is...

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Firstly, I don't want to say Start, I think I want to say Start Again,

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
which means I need to use the UI Tool to make

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
my text a little wider.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There we go! And then, I want it to just be lower.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I will just say

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Lose! You Moose is crazy! A bit of

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
fur for a while, wasn't it? But "You Lose!"

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
OK, so "You Lose!", "Start Again",

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and "Quit", nice and clear. Fine, I've made all the changes

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I need to make, so hopefully you managed to do this whole

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
video on your own! It's relatively simple. Just as a quick

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
recap, all we did here is we

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
didn't touch the LevelManager, actually. We didn't change the LevelManager at all,

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
we just went and found it in the LoseCollider,

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
well made space for it. I declared it at the top,

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
found it in the Start, I don't need to print it anymore,

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and then we simply call loadlevel  on (03b)

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
lose, nice and simple. So congratulations

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,733
and I shall see you soon!
