00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,370
Hey guys welcome back so just before we
dive in and actually get the defender

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,960
spawning working I want to sort out a
little glitch that we're going to end up

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,030
with because of the way that we are
handling this projectiles parent

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,770
placeholder; now it's a good idea to
organize your spawned objects into

00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,080
parent objects when the game starts
running, so if we have a look here, back

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,670
over on the scene view, once the game
starts running we've currently organized

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,329
that all new projectiles go into this
projectiles placeholder object and you

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,280
can see them spawning in here, all the
axis et cetera. That's a good idea

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,379
otherwise your hierarchy would end up
filling up and it'd be really hard in

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,469
this mode to see what's going on and to
get a handle on anything. So that's good

00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,049
and it does best practices out there on
the web, here's a blog post which I'll

00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,510
link you to, Glenn Stevens best
practices and he says you know spawning

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,679
objects don't let spawned objects
clutter your hierarchy

00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,629
totally agree - good idea, the way that we've
gone about it so far that I've taken you

00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:02,729
down is not ideal so let's introduce
another best practice and the second

00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,620
best practice I'm getting from another
great blog post which you'll find in the

00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,800
slides which is this devmag blog post
here and it's got a whole bunch of best

00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,420
practices for unity, we've actually got
them all on our wall, we're making sure we're infusing them

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,670
through the course and one of them is
making the game runable from any scene

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,120
Now you can read this in detail
yourself but there's a pattern here that

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,950
basically says if we need something like
this parent game holder then

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,230
find it and if we can't find it create it.
Ao that's what we're going to do in this

00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,390
video so what we gonna do here is - I'll
explain in a bit more detail what the

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,500
problem with the current way of doing
things is. You've got a link there to the

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,270
Glenn Stevens article on Unity 3d best
practices that massively overlaps with

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,090
the devmag one which is also linked on
the next slide, and I'm going to show

00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,960
you and then help you implement a pattern
for checking and creating the parent

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,980
objects rather than the way we doing it
now. So what's the problem with the way

00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,100
we're doing it now? Let's take a look. If we
drop a new defender in here like a gnome,

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,950
bang, into the scene - you need to be in scene view
clearly - and start running let's see what

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,530
happens - what happens when he starts
spawning objects? Well

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,940
he needs - you see they're spawning at the top
here? He hasn't found that there's a

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,630
projectiles object, so why not? You might
say well let's look at the gnome, he has

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,420
a prefab right and how come the
projectile parent prefab is not

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,660
connected to hit to the gnome? Well you
could and that's why I went down the

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,280
route with prefabs, you could drag the projectile
parent prefab into the projectile

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,630
parent here obeying a good rule which
is that prefabs should be dragged to

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,069
prefabs, but sometimes combining two good
rules i.e. prefab should be dragged to

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,760
prefabs and the idea that we should
parent spawned game objects actually can

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,380
create something that's still more
complicated than we need. Alright the

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,739
problem with this is you've got to do
that for every object, it has actually lost

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,900
the connection for me but even if I go
fix the connection for the gnome I've gotta

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,920
make sure it's in place for the cactus
and the star trophy et cetera - hassle right?

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,310
Just spells hassle to me so why don't we
introduce you to a whole new pattern, a

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,690
whole new way of doing things. I'm going
to start by deleting the projectiles

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,890
parent game object and the projectiles
prefab, we're not going to have it at all

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,970
alright? It doesn't exist anymore

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,060
OK then what I'm going to do is
challenge you to make the necessary

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,079
changes to the shooter script, because
that's the script that does it

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:24,390
It's specifically things that do shooting
I'm going to ask you to make the necessary

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,489
change in the shooting script to look to
see if there is a game object in the

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:34,459
hierarchy called projectiles, here's the
shooter script and if there is then

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:40,010
just use it for the parents - all this
code here can stay the same - but

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,459
if it doesn't exist then you're going to
need to create it, so as a hint it's

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,060
going to be in the void start method and
in here you're gonna put some code that's

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,940
going to follow the following pattern, let's

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,870
take a look at the slide. So here's the
pattern. My object = find object in scene

00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,470
that's kind of pseudo code that's not
gonna work but something very similar

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,820
will work, so go looking for it go
looking for something called projectiles

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,620
if it exists fine, if it doesn't exist

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,230
spawn it alright, so that's pseudocode on the
screen but it's gonna be enough for you

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:16,200
to have a go at it so go ahead try and
make this work

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,160
Awesome welcome back so let's take a
look at how we are going to make it work

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,610
So projectile parent gun and projectile
well firstly we're no longer in a publicly

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,110
expose the projectile parent, we're going to
take that pain away and we have much

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,210
more naturally now that shooters you
just tell them about their projectile

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:39,900
and their gun. Privately they worry
about whether or not they need a parent

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:47,690
to spawn to OK? so then we have a private
game object projectile parent. OK, fine

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,190
so what we do on start? We go looking for
it right so it's valid to say projectile

00:04:52,190 --> 00:05:04,540
parent equals GameObject dot find and
then projectiles; ok fine now if

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,690
something in the hierarchy called
projectiles exists, so if projectiles or

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,390
put it this way if there is nothing
called projectiles then projectile parent

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:24,330
will be null so if not projectile parent
ok if there is no result of this game

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,980
object dot find then create one, well how are you gonna create one? Projectile parent... now you might be

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,290
tempted to try and use instantiate here, don't
use instantiate - instantiate's for

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,310
instantiating prefabs, we're doing
instantiation down here

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,260
of a projectile prefab but here which is
creating a blank GameObject, so how do

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,510
you create a new Vector? You go new vector
three right? How do you create a new

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,980
anything? You use the keyword new, does that
make sense so we go looking for

00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,940
something called projectiles if we find
it then projectile parent is already set

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,600
if not projectile parent does not
evaluate so we skip over this and we go

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,010
ahead and do the parenting if however we
cannot find a projectile parent then

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,500
this will take the value of now and then
we will create one, let's see if it works and the

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,580
way I've written the code we get the
following error in the shooter script

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,550
an expression requires brackets square or
squiggly on line 14; so back to the code

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,620
what have we done? Line 14, well GameObject
What I would do here is go look at the

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,400
docs, what we're actually missing is just a
pair of brackets like that but why? So

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,159
let's go look at the docs for game
object; so here we are at the docs of

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:40,069
game object when you construct a new
game object what parameters do you

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:44,550
pass in if anything? So if you search for
constructor on the page you'll find here

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,990
in this section - and this is a general pattern for
most of the methods you'll see in unity

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,440
you may have a constructor, so let's
look at it. It's actually got three

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,349
constructors, look carefully at the docs
one signature is this that you do

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:02,520
game object and then you pass in a
string, you see them down here? They're

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,490
saying new game object call it player
alright let's move down, there's another

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,279
signature here, there should be a big black
line there isn't; another signature from

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,199
this point down, different stuff as we
said before; second signature says don't

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,900
pass anything in, new game object alright
well let's try that so now that we've

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,629
got our brackets it knows to actually
construct a new game object, let's try

00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,490
running, see what happens

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,490
Gonna get some issues here you go now we've
got five new game objects, why? Why have we got

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,900
five new game objects?

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,719
well because there are five different
things in the scene with that script

00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,529
attached and each one of them is creating
a new game object and parenting it's

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,979
projectiles to it because none of them
have actually named the GameObject

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:47,190
projectiles. So you could name the game
object projectiles like this, you could

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,909
gather this new projectile parent you've
created and then say . name equals

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:55,629
projectiles, let's just try that, why would
you do that? Good question, you wouldn't but

00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:00,180
let's just show you that it works; now
the first one immediately creates something

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,400
called projectiles, everybody else finds it and
says that's fine I'll use that and they

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,979
stuff their projectiles under there; good
news so the only thing I would say is

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,669
that why write all that code when you
can take this projectiles bit and use

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,800
the helpful constructor that lets you
name it

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,520
while you create it; I'll re-type projectiles,
there you go so we don't need to address the

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,830
projectiles . name later there is
actually a third variation down here

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,669
this one here which takes in a name and
an array of components which could be

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,040
useful if you want if you want to

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,820
construct a rich object that has a
whole lot of things already attached to

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,950
it, maybe sprite renderers, maybe scripts
whatever then you could get into that

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,240
but we're using this top version here where we
just say new game object and give it a

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,750
name while we're at it

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,210
alright guys so that is what's happening
there now this process is much more

00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,460
robust now when we drop our guys in the
scene they will just create a

00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,640
projectiles game object if there's not
already one there, so we don't even have

00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,710
to have one in the scene.

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,550
Let's just test that on a second
scene just to rub the point home

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,500
So here this scene's got no defenders in
it whatsoever, if I stick a gnome in

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,240
this scene and hit play look at the
hierarchy on the left, he immediately goes I

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,680
can't find any projectiles, I'm gonna
create one and if we stick a cactus

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,170
in he'll come along and go - you
actually have to be in the scene view so

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,390
I'll put him in the hierarchy, here is the
cactus he goes I can't find any

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,930
projectiles I'll also create one and he
will spawn all of his things if he fires

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,200
anything to the same thing; so let's do another gnome, just to prove the point, two gnomes standing on

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,810
top of each other they both find the
same projectiles object and they stick

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,180
their axes in there and that keeps our
hierarchy all happy. Point driven home

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,010
hopefully here is the general pattern
I'll leave you with the slide hopefully

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,010
you passed that challenge, and that general
pattern is pretty handy. Take a look

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,470
through the rest of those tips both on
Devmag and also on here, on Glenn

00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,430
Stevens which has most of the same stuff
as Devmag but also some other

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,280
useful best practices. so hopefully that
was helpful for you and start doing that

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,330
in your games from now.
