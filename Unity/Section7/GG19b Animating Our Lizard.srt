00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700


2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.700
So in this video we're going to be looking at different ways of animating objects.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.700
different ways of moving the transform or the pivot point of those objects.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.433
and then. options for combining those together. So by the end of it.

5
00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:19.433
what we're looking to do. and by the way. this is just a preview of what we're going to have in

6
00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:23.433
the next few videos time is. things like this. We're going to be able to put Defenders

7
00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.433
down. they're going to have Sprite Sheet Animation. some of them. These Cactuses are purely

8
00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.433
based on frame based animation. Then. these Star Trophies are pure

9
00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:35.433
bone based animation. at the top half. The Defenders here are

10
00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:39.433
rotating and translating. and then. the Attackers have a combination as

11
00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.066
well. So that's a preview of what's coming! Let me just

12
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:46.066
show you a slide that should help you to understand these different ways of

13
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:50.066
moving objects. So we've got Sprite Sheet. which is where we're changing the frames in a

14
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.066
flip-book style. We have Bone Based. which is where we are changing the transform.

15
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:58.066
rotation. or scale of the object. or part of the object like

16
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:02.066
if we look back here at the sun. The top of the sun is a Bone Based

17
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.066
Animation. just swinging left and right and pivoting around the base of the sun.

18
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.066
whereas the Cactuses are purely Sprite Sheet based. And then. we have it Moving

19
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.066
the Pivot in Script. So in the case of the Lizard. its

20
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:18.066
pivot point is moving because of a script. and the actual

21
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:22.066
frames of the animation are coming from a Sprite Sheet. So let's go through and take a look!

22
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:26.066
All the Attackers are going to be using Sprite Sheet for their animation.

23
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:30.066
they'll have no Bone Based Animation. and they will all have their pivot point moved by

24
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:34.066
script. So that's the division of labor. if you like. for the

25
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:38.066
Attackers. The Defenders. how about them? Well the Gnome and the Cactus

26
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.066
will be using Sprite Sheet Animation. but the Star Trophy

27
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:46.066
and the Grave Stone we're going to animate through Bone Based. The Star Trophy. you can already see.

28
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:50.066
is wobbling left and right. and the Grave Stone. when we get to it. is going to shake based

29
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:54.066
on a movement of it's transform. Neither of them will have any movement

30
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.066
of their pivot point in script. they're just going to sit still. And then. finally we have the

31
00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:02.066
Defender Projectiles. So what does that mean? That means things like this zucchini or Cactus...

32
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:06.066
Sorry this Zucchini or in English Courgette. [Laughs] Ah. here it goes!

33
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:10.066
Now that is a combination of two things. that is a single frame.

34
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:14.066
so it is a Sprite Sheet but it is just one frame for the Courgette

35
00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:18.066
or the what do I call it? A cucumber. that's what I call it!

36
00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:22.066
[laughs] And then. the Rotation! What's happening with Bone Based

37
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:26.066
part of the animation is the Rotation is being controlled through Bone Based

38
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:30.066
Animation. and the movement is happening through Translation

39
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:34.066
from script. So basically. we just take a single frame. we just

40
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:38.066
spin it using the Animator. and then. we move it by using script.

41
00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:42.066
So by the end of it. that'll all come together. and we'll have a rich set of different types of

42
00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:46.066
animations. So in this video we're going to focus just on animating the Lizard.

43
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:46.533


44
00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:50.533
So here we are. where we left off with our Lizard. Now there's a 5 step process outlined

45
00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:54.533
in your section notes. like that. and I'm going to take you through step by step.

46
00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:58.533
just for the Lizard and then give you time to do it yourself. So you could just watch me or you can follow along.

47
00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:02.533
but you'll have time in your challenge to actually take these steps. So the first

48
00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:06.533
step is to create a character parent and a child body object. What does that mean?

49
00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:10.533
Well. at the moment. the Lizard is the only object. What we want to do is

50
00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:14.533
Create an Empty Child object on the Lizard. So with the Lizard selected.

51
00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:18.533
and then. I'm going to call that body. Now the reason is.

52
00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:22.533
we want to move the Lizard. the top-level object.

53
00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:26.533
in script. but we want the animation to occur on the body. And we want the Lizard to

54
00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:30.533
be able to see it right in the middle of the square. so we want independent control of the position

55
00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:34.533
of the body and the rest of the Lizard as a whole. That means our Sprite Renderer

56
00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:38.533
has to come off the Lizard. so I'm going to Copy the Component. the Sprite

57
00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:42.533
Renderer of the Lizard. I'm going to go to the Body and then Paste the Component

58
00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:46.533
as new on the Body. and then. remove it from

59
00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:50.533
the Lizard. So all I've done there is moved. carefully moved the Sprite Renderer down to

60
00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:54.533
the Body. This means we can now move our Lizard around.

61
00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:58.533
Now. in terms of where our Lizard is positioned. the frame that we have

62
00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:02.533
here for this animation is not very helpful. He's mid-flight in my case. so

63
00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:06.533
if that's the case for you. then go and find yourself a Lizard appearing frame.

64
00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:10.533
that's towards the end of the animation or even the final frame. And remember

65
00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:14.533
that you can just select that frame. once you've opened the tray out. and drop it

66
00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:18.533
onto the sprite. And then. that will move the Lizard to his last

67
00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:22.533
frame of animation. Now. I can move the Body of the Lizard around. you see. like this.

68
00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:26.533
and I can get him to a nice even space like 5. 3.

69
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:30.533
And then. 5. 3 should be 1. 2. 3.

70
00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:34.533
4. 5. 1. 2. 3. So 5. 3 should be in the middle of the square he's

71
00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:38.533
nearly in the middle of. So I can make my final adjustment in the body.

72
00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:42.533
You see the power that gives us! Now our script can move the Lizard

73
00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:46.533
transform. and it could go from 5. 3. to 4. 3 or 5.

74
00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:50.533
3. or 6. 3 you see. And I can just move him along integer squares.

75
00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:54.533
Perfect. so I'll leave him there for now. And then. the Body can make the final

76
00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:58.533
adjustments. Cool! OK. so that is the Lizard positioned

77
00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:02.533
properly. The top level object just has an Animator. and the bottom

78
00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:06.533
level object has a Sprite Renderer. So that's step 1 complete! Let's have a look at the next

79
00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:10.533
step. Create the character parent and child body. Done! Number 2. ensure

80
00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:14.533
there is an Animator on the parent object. Well we already have one! Here is the parent. the Lizard.

81
00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:18.533
and it has an Animator. Wicked! Let's move on! Convert the Sprite Sheet

82
00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:22.533
into separate frames. Well in the case of the Lizard we've already done that. Here they are. they're

83
00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:26.533
already done for the appearing and for the attacking and for the

84
00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:30.533
walking state. so this is easy. Number 3. 4 even. if I could count

85
00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:34.533
add a Sprite Renderer curve to the body object. OK. let's take a little look

86
00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:38.533
at that! We have a Sprite Renderer. and if I look in the animation.

87
00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:42.533
we used to have a Sprite Renderer Curve. But it's confused now. it's gone

88
00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:46.533
yellow. because it's looking for the Sprite Renderer against the Lizard. In fact. when I

89
00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:50.533
select this line in the appearing clip. in the Animation tab.

90
00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:54.533
you can see it's trying to find it on the Lizard. In fact.

91
00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:58.533
if I play. it may even give me that error message. No it doesn't. but it's the yellow that's

92
00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:02.533
indicating that it's missing. So I'm just going to delete this clip.

93
00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:06.533
OK. so with nothing left in appearing. we're going to Add a Curve. Now.

94
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:10.533
notice you can now drill down into the body. The Animators at the Lizard

95
00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:14.533
level. but it can drill through the body. into the Sprite Renderer. and then. Sprite.

96
00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:18.533
That's where we want to go! Body. Sprite Renderer. Sprite on the

97
00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:22.533
appearing curve. Great! We get a couple of frames. leave them there for now. It's really

98
00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:26.533
handy just to leave them there. because then you can select all of the frames of appearing. pop them in.

99
00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:30.533
we've done this before. delete the frames it came with. and then. move

100
00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:34.533
the rest. Control A will select them all. over to the left. Now remember. you can hold

101
00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:38.533
down Alt and scroll. and and you can change the

102
00:06:38.533 --> 00:06:42.533
size. You've done a lot of this before. And there you go. we have an animation for Appearing.

103
00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:46.533
Let's just get the Animator up. so we can see the state. and go

104
00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:50.533
to our scene and play. There he comes. boom! Wicked! He

105
00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:54.533
appears! Now. the final thing we said we wanted him to do is appear for 3

106
00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:58.533
seconds. didn't we? So we need to decide how long we stay on

107
00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:02.533
Appearing for. Well if you look at the animation. you can see it's at 30

108
00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:06.533
samples a second. and he seems to have 24

109
00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:10.533
frames. So we've got to decide in this transition. from Lizard Appearing

110
00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:14.533
to Walking. how many cycles are we going to do to end up

111
00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:18.533
in 3 seconds in total. Well at 30

112
00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:22.533
frames a second it's tricky to work out. How about if I set the Animation to 24

113
00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:26.533
samples a second. It makes life a little bit easier because one cycle then

114
00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:30.533
lasts precisely a second. in which case the exit time

115
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:34.533
for this transition is after 3 cycles. This is an exit time in number

116
00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:38.533
of cycles. And you see Lizard Appearing there. Lizard Appearing. Lizard Appearing 3

117
00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:42.533
times. each one lasting 1 second. And I shouldn't have messed up the frame-rate too much. Let's have a look!

118
00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:46.533
There he goes. and that's appearing for 3 seconds. Great!

119
00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:50.533
So the next thing we want to do is have him walking for 3

120
00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:54.533
seconds. So the aim of this game is to have the Lizard Appearing. the Lizard

121
00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:58.533
Walking. and the Lizard Attacking. So I think this is a good time to put you over to your challenge. I

122
00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:02.533
think you can try finishing it off. and I will help you if you need it. So let's see

123
00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:06.533
if you can finish animating your Lizard. Animate the Lizard in place. using the Sprite Sheet

124
00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:10.533
just as I did with that 5 step process. but do the same thing now

125
00:08:10.533 --> 00:08:14.533
for the two other animation states. for the Walking and the Attacking

126
00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:18.533
states. And then. cycle through the states every 3 seconds. So we want him to Appear

127
00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:22.533
for 3 seconds. Walk for 3 seconds. and then. Attack for 3 seconds.

128
00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:26.533
So pause the video. see if you can make that work and figure out what goes where now. and if you can't

129
00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:30.533
for any reason. no problem. just resume the video I'll show you how to do it. And you'll have ample opportunity

130
00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:34.533
to practice this on all of the other characters.

131
00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:38.533
Welcome back! O.K. so let's look at the Walking

132
00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:42.533
animation state now. In the Animation tab. go down to Walking. We've got the

133
00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:46.533
same problem. it's gone yellow because it's lost track. I'm going to go

134
00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:50.533
find the Walking frames. down in my Project tab.

135
00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:54.533
under Assets. I'm going to pull all my Walking... Ah. hang on. before I do that

136
00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:58.533
I'm going to add a Body. Remember Sprite Renderer. Sprite.

137
00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:02.533
Curve. that one there. I'm going to leave the frame.

138
00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:06.533
so that I'm scrolling up with two fingers on my Trackpad or rolling the Mouse Wheel.

139
00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:10.533
Drop the frames in. delete the stuff that came at the start. Control

140
00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:14.533
A or box select around. Drag it to the

141
00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:18.533
left. observe how long this is. It's 15 frames.

142
00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:22.533
so it's 1/2 a second. because we have 15 frames and

143
00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:26.533
30 frames a second. therefore we want to go from Walking to Attacking after how many cycles?

144
00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:30.533
Well it's going to be 6. because we have 1/2 a second each.

145
00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:34.533
Let's check that works!

146
00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:38.533
1.000. 2.000. 3.000. Appearing. Walking for 1. 2.

147
00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:42.533
3. and then. he goes to Attacking. Well of course he doesn't go to Attacking. because that's the final

148
00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:46.533
state I need to do. Same process. Delete the curve!

149
00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:50.533
Add a new Curve. selecting Body. That's important! Then. Sprite Renderer.

150
00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:54.533
then Sprite. Cool! Default frames. they're fine. we'll leave them

151
00:09:54.533 --> 00:09:58.533
there for now. They're handy. they prevent us from losing our line.

152
00:09:58.533 --> 00:10:02.533
We want to find the Attacking state. Ooh. lots and lots of frames in this guy.

153
00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:06.533
Drop it in. delete what was there.

154
00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:10.533
drag to the left. observe how long this lasts for.

155
00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:14.533
This is lasting for nearly 3 seconds on its own. so that's going to be good enough. So at a

156
00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:18.533
frame-rate of 15 a second it's lasting nearly 3. Let's take a look! Animator

157
00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:22.533
open. play. He appears for about 3 seconds.

158
00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:26.533
as before he transitions to Walking. does 6 cycles of

159
00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:30.533
Walking. and then. he's just doing 1 cycle of Attacking. which happens to last

160
00:10:30.533 --> 00:10:34.533
about 3 seconds. Ah. he's not doing 1 cycle. [Laughs]

161
00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:38.533
So to limit the amount of tacking. rather than it just looping around. I'm going to transition back

162
00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:42.533
to Lizard Appearing. for now. and exit after 1 cycle.

163
00:10:42.533 --> 00:10:46.533
So in the scene view. let's just take a look and make sure it works. He

164
00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:50.533
appears for 3 cycles. walks for 6. because each one takes

165
00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:54.533
1/2 a seconds. attacks for just 1 cycle. and then goes

166
00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:58.533
back to appearing. Awesome. so that is our Lizard animated! Just

167
00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:02.533
to recap. let me go show you the slide that shows you the process!

168
00:11:02.533 --> 00:11:06.533
Now. you'll make more sense. Here it is! So we create the parent.. we create

169
00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:10.533
the child. we ensure there's an Animator on the parent object. because it can reach into the child.

170
00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:14.533
We convert Sprite Sheet into separate frames. we add a Sprite Renderer Curve to the

171
00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:18.533
body object. and then. we adjust animation to taste and repeat. So that's what

172
00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:22.533
we're going to do for all of the other animals. in our upcoming videos!

173
00:11:22.533 --> 00:11:24.033
