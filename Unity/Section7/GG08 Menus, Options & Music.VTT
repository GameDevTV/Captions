00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Hey welcome back so how did you get on with
that challenge? I hope you've got all your

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.410 align:middle line:90%
menus set up, I'm going to show you how I
do it in this video, we are going to be customising

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.449 align:middle line:90%
the win and lose screens, adding a new options
scene for the first time, it's going to be

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.439 align:middle line:90%
blank for now but it's going to have two buttons
on it just "back" and "defaults" so once your

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:90%
in options you have the option, excuse the
double use to go back to the start scene or

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.029 align:middle line:90%
to click defaults which will in future load
from defaults, for now it'll do nothing and

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:90%
then we'll have a level 01 with a win and
lose button on it. Temporary win and lose

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.469 align:middle line:90%
conditions until the script can do it; and
then test that all the navigation works properly.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Now if you've already got yours working let's
just briefly talk about the level manager

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.969 align:middle line:90%
before you skip through this video so we are
continuing to use the level manager as we

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:90%
have been as a prefab. Why? Well let me show
you let me just do the level manager bit first,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:90%
let's go to the first scene, the splash scene.
Let's take a look at our level manager, and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to just pop into its script briefly.
Now one thing you may have noticed already

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:90%
is that its always going to auto-load the
next level and what we really want to be able

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:90%
to do is disable that so its a simple if autoLoadNextLevelAfter
equals 0 then, what are we going to do? Well

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.149 align:middle line:90%
I think it would be nice just to log to say
that that's happened, we can just say Debug,Log,

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:84%
auto load disabled.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's fine else, we'll do what we were
going to do anyway which is just invoke and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.579 align:middle line:90%
just hope your designer doesn't put a negative
number in and cause some weird problems but

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.939 align:middle line:90%
it'll just error out. OK, fantastic. So now
that modification to the level manager just

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.049 align:middle line:90%
means that if we put 0 into autoLoadNextLevel
let's see what happens. OK so we get an error

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:90%
on line 17 can't convert float to bool. So
can you see what I've done on line 17 there?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
I've said if autoLoadNextLevel equals zero
that's an assignment, equals equals is the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.009 align:middle line:90%
comparison. OK, it was trying to set zero
which it was treating as a bool into a float

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.200 align:middle line:90%
which wasn't working. So, try equals equals,
there you go, and it says on the log, autoload

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:90%
disabled right? And then yet if we had set,
say, I think we had 3 seconds, and play, now

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.769 align:middle line:84%
the autoload will work, there you go, fine.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, another thing to say about the level
manager. It's about prefabbing it and how

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:90%
we use it. Let's take a look here, we have
an instance of a level manager here on this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:90%
splash screen. Now ultimately I like to see
most things in a scene being prefabs - at

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:90%
least certainly things that are going to be
used somewhere else. So let's go through them.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Persistent music, does that need to be a prefab?
No, because we're only going to have one of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
them in the entire game because it persists.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Ok, level manager, should that be a prefab?
Yes, it makes lots of sense for the level

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:90%
manager to be a prefab and now that it's set
up how we want it, let's prefab it. How do

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:90%
we do that? Well just drag it to your assets.
That makes the blue prefab box, and I'm going

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:90%
to put it in a folder called, imaginatively,
can you guess the name? Yes, prefabs. Fantastic.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Alright, so we have a prefab level manager
indicated two ways. Slightly blue, very hard

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:90%
to see, secondly you get information about
the prefab at the top of the inspector. Main

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.099 align:middle line:90%
camera, do we need to make that prefab? Not
really, there's nothing special about it.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.349 align:middle line:90%
Canvas is pretty unique to this scene, and
the same with the event system and load sound.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:90%
So actually we're reasonable in only having
the level manager prefabbed here. Over to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:90%
the start scene, you'll notice we have a level
manager in the start scene but it's all wrong.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.519 align:middle line:90%
There's no script, and it hasn't got the right
version. Let's just kill it, and this is where

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.939 align:middle line:90%
we just take our prefab, and with some confidence
drop it in. Now we have the right level manager

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.799 align:middle line:90%
and we just take off the autoLoadNextLevel.
Notice the autoLoadNextLevel goes bold the

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.709 align:middle line:90%
moment you change its value from 3 to 0. That's
saying "this is different to the prefab" which

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:90%
is fine. You may not want your prefab to auto
load next level after three seconds so you

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.959 align:middle line:90%
can change it back at the prefab if you want.
OK.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:90%
So they're the dependencies so teh prefab
now won't auto load next levels by default

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.709 align:middle line:90%
and this particular one also isn't. We could
always revert to the prefab now and it won't

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:90%
be bold now because its the same as the prefab.
Bold means that this value is different to

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:84%
the prefab.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.269 align:middle line:90%
Now you might quite rightly ask do we need
a level manager in this scene at all? Well,

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.280 align:middle line:90%
yes and no. Let's take a look at the buttons
to answer that question. On the buttons we

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:90%
need to pass in to the OnClick event either
a level manager prefab or a level manager

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.190 align:middle line:90%
instance and I would suggest that you always
now in future pass a level manager prefab

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:90%
in because it works fine, but we do need to
have a level manager there so for instance

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:90%
let's just do a test, let's load level string
00 Splash from here and let's try taking the

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:90%
level manager out of the level. You see the
choice is, if you're not changing this auto-load

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:90%
next level if you're sticking with the default
value you can actually do away with the level

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:90%
manager. Let's try it. In fact let's start
from the start scene, the splash scene. Let's

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:84%
see what we've got.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:90%
We come in after one second, no level manager
in here, click the start button it goes back

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:90%
to the start, splash screen. I want to show
you something on that splash scene while we're

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:90%
here, you should never go back to the splash
screen. Why not? Because look, if we pause

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:90%
here we've got two persistent music players.
So that's the downside of having taken away

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:90%
this singleton pattern and this check but
we're never going to go back to this splash

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:90%
screen, that's the whole point of injecting
it at this point. Remember the diagram where

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:90%
I showed you that we never actually go back
to that splash screen on the left there.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Alright, so that's enough said about the music
player. Hopefully, sorry the level manager.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully you understand that you only need
to inject a level manager prefab into the

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:90%
scene if you want to change the autoLoadNextLevel
so that's going to save you some time so that's

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:90%
fantastic. Alright, so now let's whip through
and get all this done. So we're going to need

00:05:49.260 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:90%
an options button in here so let me just clone
a start button and call it options. I might

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.750 align:middle line:90%
simplify start button; well options button
actually, yeah let's be specific.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:90%
OK so we have an options button, where is
it, well it's sitting right on top are these

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:90%
two spaced out? Or too near together? Yes,
far too near, let's just get in, space them

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%
out. I'll do this quite quick, I'm sure you're
all very aware of what I'm doing here. So

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:90%
options goes there, the UI element isn't wide
enough to cater for it, that's juts fine,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Start Options, Quit. so what does start do?
Well, start is going to load a level, and

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:90%
it's going to go to level 1. We don't have
a level 1. How are we going to name our level

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:84%
1?

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Well I'm suggesting this slightly strange
setup where we say 02 as a prefix so they

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:90%
sort nicely and then level zero one. So I'm
going to use that. I'm going to duplicate

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:90%
the start scene because it already has all
the UI set up as I want it. So, 02 level_01.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%
One of the benefits of this is that if we
duplicate this we continue to get levels numbered

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:90%
in order so look how quickly we can roll out
levels. Quite nice, eh? Alright, so lets go

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:90%
into level one and customise it. I'm going
to take away the background for now, image

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:90%
altogether, I'm going to take away the title
and the subtitle and just end up with two

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:90%
buttons which are going to be win and lose.
Win condition and let's make the text the

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:90%
same as the button, win condition like that,
maybe move it to the bottom left, or the bottom

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:90%
right. It's kind of making progress, it's
forward so that's fine; and then let's have

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:90%
a lose condition button. Hey I think I may
have spelt lose right this time round, we

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:90%
don't need to get hammered in the forums.
If I'm lucky, I may not have done, who cares.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a word, you get what I mean.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Win condition, lose condition. So we have
these buttons now, that's great. So what's

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:90%
going to happen on the win condition - just
wire this up really quickly, well we're going

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:90%
to go to a Win screen which doesn't exist
at the moment but what are we going to call

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:90%
it? Well we have a plan, so let's use our
plan. Here's our plan.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:17.440 align:middle line:90%
So 03-a win, 03-b lose. So let's just make
those levels?Or just at least wire up those

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:33.300 align:middle line:90%
buttons right now in a hopeful way. 03a win
and 03b lose. OK, fantastic. So, let's make

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:40.060 align:middle line:90%
those levels as well, now, if you've already
done all this, you really are, I'm not going

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:90%
to tell you anything exciting in the rest
of this video. I specifically put the important

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:90%
stuff at the front which is where we talk
about the level manager, why we prefab it

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:90%
and your options there. Now I'm literally
just going to go through these and set these

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:90%
levels up so you're absolutely welcome to
keep on watching I want to put it in for completeness

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.330 align:middle line:84%
but it is entirely up to you.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Look at the options. If you win you've got
the option to start or quit, found a plus

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and minus sign there that's a bit of fun,
some sort of keyboard combination led to that;

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll go for a lose screen, we can
be more specific about this later. By the

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:90%
way, if you have a font that auto-capitalises
like I have, I tend to be careful that I still

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:90%
write it correctly in terms of my title case
over here because if we ever change the font

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:90%
to a different one it mean that it will come
out right so just a tip there.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Alright, lets just test this navigation; win
and lose condition navigation, lose condition

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:90%
- OK the old chestnut about build order, I'm
actually going to finish off the levels before

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:90%
I start adding things to the build order,
I don't want to keep going in to build order,

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:90%
so we have - we need a level two and that's
about it actually. Oh, and options, the crucial

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:90%
one. 01b options, let's do that now. See how
this makes it quite clear? It kind of shows

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:90%
the sequence in the scenes - we go from the
zero scene that we never go back to to all

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:90%
the one scenes i.e. the start and options
to all the twos, let's have another couple

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:90%
of levels, you see how easy that was with
duplicate, and then the threes are about the

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
lose and the loop back.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:90%
OK so just the options screen now, I said
we were going to have a back button

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:90%
we were going to have a defaults button, so
let's do that. Perfect. Defaults, back, we

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:90%
can ditch the start on this one. Immediately
start naming and changing your titles, choose

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:90%
your weapon or something. OK defaults and
back. OK we'll worry about the spacing of

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:90%
all these things a little bit later, what
I'm trying to do is quickly get to the correct

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:90%
navigation order. How's level two looking?
Fine, level three? Looking fine. Great. OK.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's add all this to the build order,
grab all your scenes there, just drop them

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:90%
in the build order, get rid of any duplicates,
check that they load sensibly, splash start,

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:90%
two three you see they automatically end up
in the build order in the correct order as

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:90%
well or a reasonable order which is great.
Now let's try. Let's just start in the splash

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:90%
screen. One second delay. Sure it's too short
but that's fine. Options takes you to the

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:90%
wrong place so, you just literally go through,
wire up all these buttons properly. So, 01b

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:90%
options, in fact while we're here let's check
all the buttons, start button should take

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:90%
you not to the splash screen any more but
to 02 level 01. Fine, quit should do an application

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:90%
dot quit, doesn't at the moment, so quit needs
a handler what are we going to give it as

00:11:54.610 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:90%
the handler? Yeah the level manager prefab
that's the chestnut OK. So level manager quit

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
request.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:90%
So let's just cycle through the buttons. Start
goes to level two, 01b options, that looks

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:90%
good, so that scene is fine just work through
your scenes now.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:90%
What is defaults going to do? Nothing, at
the moment, that's absolutely fine. It's not

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:90%
doing nothing, so let's make it do nothing.
OK we don't want it doing unpredictable stuff,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:90%
back what's back going to do? It is going
to do something. We give it the prefab and

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:90%
it's going to take us back to the what's the
name of the scene - 01a start. Fantastic,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:90%
so do they look right? Nothing and 01a start,
cool, and then your levels should, in theory

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:90%
have the buttons both ding the right thing
because we copied the scene, yup, Win scene,

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:84%
start button.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, the start button. Are you annoyed with
the start button yet? I'm annoyed with the

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:90%
start button, I'm annoyed by the fact that
I'm redoing this start button a hundred times.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do? How are we going
to get around that? If we're redoing something

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:90%
regularly, we prefab it. So let's just prefab
the start button, why not? There it is, you

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:90%
see this start button in this scene already
does what we want it to do. If it's going

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:90%
to take us to the start menu why not just
have it as a prefab?So on the win scene I've

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:90%
already got a start button here, I can take
it out of the scene altogether now if I drag

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:90%
the start button prefab straight into the
hierarchy it will actually come in in the

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:90%
place it was on the other scenes which I'm
happy with and you can see it's blue now it's

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:90%
a prefab. Quit button. Well again, the Quit
button should be prefab. Let's go find it

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:90%
in a scene that it works OK in, like here,
prefab it, yeah and then we use the prefab

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:90%
so now we don't need to keep wiring up these
buttons the same, it's kind of crazy just

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:90%
delete the button with confidence, drag the
prefab across and it will come in with the

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:90%
position it had in the other scenes for consistency
and with exactly the same wiring.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.279 align:middle line:90%
Why do we call it wiring? There are no wires
here, just lines of code. So this one I can

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:90%
get even more time back I can delete my start
button and my quit button. Go to the prefabs

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:90%
and drop them in. See starting to speed up
our development, which is what we want. OK

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:90%
let's have a final test. Oh hang on, there's
one thing I've forgotten. The music I want

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:90%
to make sure that on level one I get some
different music so go to your splash screen

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:90%
and what we want to do, how big an array do
we need here in the level music change array?

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at your build settings, when do
we want to change the music? We're going to

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:90%
change it on level index three, so we need
a four element array, and then we're going

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:90%
to change it again for win and possibly lose,
it's entirely up to you what you have; what

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.730 align:middle line:90%
sort of sound you play on win and lose, but
I think I'm going to make my array a full

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:90%
eight element array now so I've got complete
choice over what I put where so let's make

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:90%
it an eight element array in your persistent
music music manager array and then pick myself

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:90%
a quick bit of music for the game, fr actually
playing the game. So I'm going to go to glitchthegame,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.060 align:middle line:90%
find a piece of music for the actual playing
that I like the sound of it's under downloads,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:90%
music, what shall we go with? That's a bit
too noddy. That's a bit of fun, why not moon

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:90%
music? So I'm going to have moon music on
level one now of course you can have different

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:90%
music on every level, but that's entirely
up to you. Let's get it into the sounds, you

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:90%
know how to do this, Import, new asset, moon
musc. In it comes, may take a while turn off

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%
3D sound and apply. Fine.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it's long enough, it's going
to be interesting to see what happens when

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:90%
this loops, let's listen to that music a bit
carefully OK so go to your persistent music

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:90%
manager, bring in the moon music under which
element. Again you're going to need to look

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:56.160 align:middle line:90%
in your build settings, this does keep everything
in one place which is nice, element 3, you

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
see how these correspond if I line them up
like this, splash screen is element 0, Start

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:90%
menu goes to Spooky Groddle, element three
goes to... yeah? Very easy.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Moon music goes into level three, let's try
it now. Test our system. Short delay on purpose,

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:18.180 align:middle line:90%
so we can hurry up development. Background
music plays, go into options it continues

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:90%
to play unbroken, go back and the music restarts
that's OK, it's kind of resetting you I'm

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:84%
back at the start menu, yeah?

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Fine, start. Then the game music starts. Cool,
lose condition, no change, because we haven't

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:90%
told it to change. Start, good, win condition,
you win, start, hey - we have a set of music.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Now you might want different music on the
completion - you know when you win or lose

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.399 align:middle line:90%
but this video's getting rather long so I'm
going to leave it at that for now and I might

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:90%
drop in some other music in a future video
just for the win and lose scenes; but you

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.570 align:middle line:90%
get the idea, let's just revise the slide
at the beginning of this section and make

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:90%
sure that we've achieved everything that we
wanted to.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.309 align:middle line:90%
Customising Win and Lose done; option scene
blank for now done, back and default done,

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:10.809 align:middle line:90%
level one done we actually went a step further
and went to two and three and we tested it

00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:14.309 align:middle line:90%
all works properly. Awesome! Enjoy that, show
it off to your friends, you can even share

00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:17.679 align:middle line:90%
this by the way if you like now you can just
say guys, what do you think of my menu? When

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:90%
you've got this far why not just upload this
project to GameBucket and share it? Sure it

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.929 align:middle line:90%
doesn't do anything, but at least people can
comment on your graphics, on your choice of

00:17:24.929 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
music, and your delays and everything else.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Cool, congratulations and I'll see you soon.
