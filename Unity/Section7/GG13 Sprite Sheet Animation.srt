00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:09.500
Hey guys and welcome to a new chapter in
this game. We're gonna do some animation at

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.380
last. We're gonna talk about what a sprite
sheet is. also known as a sprite Atlas. we're gonna

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.440
make a comparison to bone based
animation; we're gonna import and slice

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.080
sprite sheets and then make our first
animation. So what is a sprite sheet? Well

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.289
if you go to google images and search
for sprite sheet these things are all

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.539
sprite sheets. they're frames of animation.
Remember the old flip books? I'll just

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.879
search for flip book... this type of thing
where you flick through. it turns out if

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.879
your brain sees more than about 24
still images a second it blends them all

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.940
together and that's how they discovered
and made movies so that's the basis of a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.319
sprite sheet animation. The other type of
animation that we've got and we're gonna

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.549
be using a lot more in 3d in unity is
bone based animation. so on the left you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.320
have a character from an open source
project called dragon bones and he

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.130
has all his limbs separate and then what you
can do is use pivot points like sticking

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.480
a pin through pieces of card and then
have these bits of the body move

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.770
relative to one another. So that is bone
based on the left

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
sprite sheet or sprite atlas animation is on
the right. and that's where you have

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.170
multiple frames of an animation all laid out
on one sheet like that. Normally they're in

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.530
a regular grid. this guy this Ninja isn't
in a regular grid actually but normally

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.330
they would be. So how would you find
yourself a sprite sheet? Well for this

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.940
game I'm going to use the sprite sheets
from glitch again. If we scroll down to

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.530
actually get to be on the home page to
get to the assets... Glitch the game you've

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.200
got downloads but you've also got see all
details and downloads. from there you can

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.290
get to a full sprite sheet. it's very big. three
hundred and odd meg. So you could download

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.409
that and pick a sprite sheet. you can pick the sprite I use from the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.850
course assets or you could just go to
google images and just search for sprite

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.920
sheet. Or sprite

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.150
atlas and you will end up with things
like this. and they will normally be in a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.830
regular grid like this girl. The other
thing you want to look for is the fact it's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.310
on a transparent background indicated by
the hash. OK so once you've got one of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.410
these sprite sheets how would you work
out how to import it? How would we get it into unity

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.930
Well let's take a look I'm gonna do that
with my chosen asset right now so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.760
import new asset. I've got this glitch
PNGs folder here and I've still got a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.629
bunch of things I'm interested in using.
foxes and all the rest of it and one of

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.890
these guys is a deimaginator and he has
an appear animation so let's use that.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.030
So when your spreadsheet first comes in
it's just gonna be treated as a single

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.859
sprite and it isn't a single sprite so
we need to go up to the inspector. make

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.660
sure that the texture type is sprite. and
then that the sprite mode is multiple.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.099
Now click sprite editor and you'll open
up something like this. Now how we gonna

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.930
get all these guys out we don't do it
manually so that's actually a slice

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.940
option at the top left and we can go to
grid. And it's going to say what's the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.049
pixel size of these boxes? Well. good
question. you've got to go work that out

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.590
So how are you going to work it out?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.799
Well here's the basic formula for
working it out. what we want to do is.

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.440
assuming there's no padding and grid
sheets normally have no padding then the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.489
width is the image width divided by the
columns and the height is the image

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.260
height divided by the rows.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.940
So what does that actually mean? Well
let's look at this image; I'll look at it in

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:49.349
my system. whatever your default image
editor is. and go to the inspector on the Mac

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.919
or if you're on a PC just ask your image
editor what size is this sheet and

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.410
it's saying it's 753 by 1674 pixels. so
what I tend to do he was just open up a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.349
calculator and then have this image size
visible on the screen

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.450
753 divided by one. two three columns

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:19.450
251. so it's 251 pixels wide. I'll just keep a note of
that for the moment 251 and then what is

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:34.200
the height 1674 divided by 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9 so
1674 over 9... 186. 251 / 186 so over in your

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:45.550
sprite editor slice grid 251. 186. slice
and they've laid their sheet out in a nice way

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.180
so look it's perfect. if we scroll in each
frame is its own box. and yes the guy

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.910
moves to the left but he's supposed to. he's
jumping into the scene. there's no padding. it

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.180
all works just fine. click Apply; and then
close your sprite editor. Now. let's take a look

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.240
what've we got here? Look at that. when you click the
little arrow every frame of this

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.600
animation is separately now shown when
you unpack that sprite like that. isn't that

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.419
cool? I think it is. so that's how you
work it out. you just basically say how

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.190
many are there wide. how many are there high and do the division. Pretty simple. so what I want

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.880
you to do now is pause the video
Find yourself a sprite

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.340
sheet it doesn't have to be the one I've
used. it doesn't even have to be from

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.850
Glitch it can be from anywhere. and calculate
your own grid width and height and import and slice your

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.600
own sprite sheet. So go ahead. pause the video and do that now please.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.750
OK. so now you've got all the frames of
animation set up I bet just dying to

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.210
make this little guy move. Me too. Some of
you may already know there's a shortcut

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.680
to this which is to select all of these
frames and drag them into the hier archy

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.919
but don't do that because it just does
too much in one go and you won't have

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.710
the basic understanding plus it tends to
mess things up a little bit in terms of

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.060
where everything where everything sits
and how things are related you can do

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.490
that later once you understand what's
going on but let me take you through the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.180
first principles first OK. of how we're gonna set
this up. So what we need to do first is

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.240
say well we need a  game object. so let's
just have an empty GameObject. let's

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.450
call it lizard and let's just leave him where
he is. Now don't worry about how these

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:20.070
things sit relative to the game space at
all. in fact in this video we are

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.990
not going to make these sprites sit
properly on the game space. we need to

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.730
make a serious change to the level
camvas shortly. as you'll see. So I'm just going

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.730
to put my lizard GameObject at the
origin like that and then double click

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.830
on it to frame it

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.380
fantastic so let's take one of these
frames and use that as the avatar

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.950
for the animation it would be helpful to
use a frame where you can kind of see

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.180
what's going on; so the last frame's not
particularly helpful. the first frame is

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.830
not particularly helpful. typically
something in the middle is quite helpful

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:56.220
Here if you drag that onto your lizard.
then look and see what's happened it's

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.710
actually created a new object with a
sprite renderer so one way of doing it

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.860
but it's pretty messy cuz you got a new
sub-object on your lizard there. so I would

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:14.110
prefer that you went to your lizard and
manually just add a sprite renderer so we

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.410
know what we're doing. then grab a
frame. a single sprite. drop it onto the

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.400
sprite renderer and double click the lizard to
frame it. don't worry about the fact he's

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.380
crazy scale compared to the background
move it away from the background if you

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.670
wish. there he is OK. so there you just
have a lizard which only has a sprite

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.120
renderer with one of these sprites on it.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.210
Fantastic. that is a great starting point.
so what comes next?

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:45.960
Well next we need to add an animator so if we go
to the component menu and have a look

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.910
through and see what we've got. and you start
typing anima- you're gonna get animation

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.260
and animator. we want the animator. The animation

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.630
system is being phased out. So
use the animator. So now you've got an

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.960
animator. We'll do absolutely nothing
quite yet. because what you need is an

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.460
animation controller next. so let's
collapse down our sprite. make ourselves a

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.680
folder called animations

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.639
go into it and then go to assets or
right-click in here and say create

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:21.669
animation controller and it's an
animation controller for the lizard

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:26.350
there we are now if you double-click
into that. what have we got? We have any

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.690
state at the moment. that's it. It just has a...
no animation states. I'll explain that

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.510
in a moment.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.700
Pop back to your lizard. Now if you
click on your lizard. where it's asking

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.690
for an animation controller you can now
drag your new blank animation controller

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.390
in to him. OK. that's fantastic.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.760
Now what we need to do is we need to
create an animation state. and that's

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.250
going to be his appearing in the scene
state. At the moment there are no states

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.880
Firstly I want to reorganize my workspace I'm
going to put my animator down the

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.800
bottom which is my state diagram in
future this will go from any state to

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.140
appear to walking to attacking to
walking again. It's going to be that kind

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.810
of loop as you saw in lazer defender and
at the top I'm gonna create a new

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:17.089
window which is my animation window I'm
going to dock that up next to game. So this new

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:23.279
layout here I may as well save. right? Save
layout and call it

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:29.120
animation and if you want a different
layout of windows. knock yourself out. You

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.610
have multiple screens. do what you like.
This is how I need to do it for this

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.250
recording. Great. so let's recap we've got a
lizard with a sprite renderer.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:42.800
one of the frames just as a placeholder
and an animation with this animation controller on

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.350
it. Now we need to actually add an
animation clip. which is the thing that

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.000
makes him move. you click on the lizard
first. very important. In the

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.150
animation window click this little drop
down here and then you'll see create new

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:03.230
clip. You see that? It's actually an unlabeled drop
down. Right once you click on Create new

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.820
clip this is where it says create new
animation for the game object lizard. fine

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.700
let's do that let's call it

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:17.240
lizard appearing. That's very simple and we have a
state called lizard appearing. its orange

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.160
which means it's the default state

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.230
and we have a line in our animation for
this clip. We are nearly there

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:31.009
we've nearly created ourselves an animation.
So. go back to your images. open up your

00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:38.060
dude. select all of his animation frames
and drop them. like so. onto the animation.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:44.279
You can see in the animation timeline a tiny
indication of of the animation playing

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:49.300
through in time. In fact if you scroll
your mouse wheel you can zoom in and pan

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.649
and you can see all of the frames.
Fantastic. it's not actually jumping to the

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:56.800
right it's just that it's showing one
frame after the other

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.759
now at the moment you have probably come
by default into animation recording mode

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:07.329
you see there's a record button here and
all of the play pause and next step but tons

00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:11.009
have gone red. that's 'cause the
animator's now expecting you to start

00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:15.370
playing with the animation in the scene
view and recording what we call

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.560
key frames but we're not going to be
doing that quite yet so come out of

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.860
recording mode by clicking the record
button. now your red play is no longer

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:29.970
a play. Now I just want to preview the
animation to finish this video so how are we

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:35.139
gonna preview the animation? Click on the
animator and then on your lizard

00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:36.889
and click play

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:43.800
let's just take a look. go back to the scene
view... there he is. he's jumping. So in the scene

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.120
view if you frame on your lizard and you
can see in the animation state

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.699
Controller you see it's looping around
jump jump jump jump fantastic. There's

00:11:52.699 --> 00:11:56.029
another way to preview this guy as well.
you can stop playing - you don't even have

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:01.079
to be in play mode - double-click
lizard appearing and you should at the bottom of your

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:05.589
inspector. once you've double-click that
state. have a preview panel; if you don't

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:08.680
you'll be able to bring it up from the bottom.
Now it's gonna say no model is available

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.309
for the preview. well give it a model.
drag the lizard on. OK. now it's almost uselessly

00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:19.309
small but preview it and then you can
use the right mouse button drag to turn

00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:24.089
it round. look from either side. there you go.
you can see the preview now why is it so

00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:25.540
damn fast? Well.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.480
this speed here is the speed of the
preview. the speed I'm changing in the

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.459
inspector. That's not going to indicate
how fast it's actually gonna run the

00:12:34.459 --> 00:12:39.769
reason it's too fast is this setting up
here . At the top of our animation window

00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:45.120
we have sixty samples which means it's
assuming this animation was drawn at 60

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.589
frames or samples a second. Well let's change
that down to maybe twelve. and you can

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:53.790
immediately see the effect in the
preview window down the bottom right

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.949
here he's now jumping in too slowly I
would say. that looks a bit silly so

00:12:57.949 --> 00:13:01.040
let's just change the samples up until
it looks right.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.029
Ideally would ask your artist how fast
it should be. 24 frames maybe try 30. now here

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:12.750
we're just gonna have to pick something that
you think looks good but I think 30

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.550
frame animations will look fine. it looks
like this is set up to be around about

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.980
that. Now because you change the samples per
second here in your animation. when you

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.670
go back to the scene and play - you'll have to go
back to scene of course. there you go -

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.380
his speed has changed and you're looping
around the lizard appearing animation

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.980
state. Before you run off and create too
many animations like this just hold your

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.579
horses a moment and wait a few videos
because I'm going to show you that we

00:13:37.579 --> 00:13:41.850
actually need to structure both our
animator and our sprite a little bit

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.500
differently in this game to get the
flexibility we need. so just create this

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.250
single animation for now and we will add
the others

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.010
a little bit later with my guidance. So to recap.
this is how you do it

00:13:54.010 --> 00:14:00.010
You create an empty GameObject. you drag one of
the sprites on as a placeholder better to

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.720
actually add a sprite renderer and drag
the sprite to the sprite renderer

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.829
add an animator - animations are being
phased out - go into to the animation window

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:11.860
and then create a new clip and go from
there

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.130
Fantastic. remember this slide is
available for you. all of the slides are

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.870
available at the start of the section.
just download them under your section

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.880
notes. now it's time for you to make your
animation. Make and preview your own; make

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.540
sure the frame rate. the samples is
correct and don't worry about it fitting

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.139
in the game window for now. it will not
sit properly on this level canvas because our level

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:34.870
canvas is not set up right right now.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:35.860
See you soon.

Language: en

00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,500
Hey guys and welcome to a new chapter in
this game. We're gonna do some animation at

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,380
last. We're gonna talk about what a sprite
sheet is, also known as a sprite Atlas, we're gonna

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,440
make a comparison to bone based
animation; we're gonna import and slice

00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,080
sprite sheets and then make our first
animation. So what is a sprite sheet? Well

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,289
if you go to google images and search
for sprite sheet these things are all

00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:36,539
sprite sheets, they're frames of animation.
Remember the old flip books? I'll just

00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,879
search for flip book... this type of thing
where you flick through, it turns out if

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,879
your brain sees more than about 24
still images a second it blends them all

00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,940
together and that's how they discovered
and made movies so that's the basis of a

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,319
sprite sheet animation. The other type of
animation that we've got and we're gonna

00:00:56,319 --> 00:01:01,549
be using a lot more in 3d in unity is
bone based animation, so on the left you

00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:06,320
have a character from an open source
project called dragon bones and he

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,130
has all his limbs separate and then what you
can do is use pivot points like sticking

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,480
a pin through pieces of card and then
have these bits of the body move

00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,770
relative to one another. So that is bone
based on the left

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,270
sprite sheet or sprite atlas animation is on
the right, and that's where you have

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,170
multiple frames of an animation all laid out
on one sheet like that. Normally they're in

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,530
a regular grid, this guy this Ninja isn't
in a regular grid actually but normally

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,330
they would be. So how would you find
yourself a sprite sheet? Well for this

00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,940
game I'm going to use the sprite sheets
from glitch again. If we scroll down to

00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:49,530
actually get to be on the home page to
get to the assets... Glitch the game you've

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,200
got downloads but you've also got see all
details and downloads, from there you can

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,290
get to a full sprite sheet, it's very big, three
hundred and odd meg. So you could download

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,409
that and pick a sprite sheet, you can pick the sprite I use from the

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,850
course assets or you could just go to
google images and just search for sprite

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,920
sheet. Or sprite

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,150
atlas and you will end up with things
like this, and they will normally be in a

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,830
regular grid like this girl. The other
thing you want to look for is the fact it's

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,310
on a transparent background indicated by
the hash. OK so once you've got one of

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,410
these sprite sheets how would you work
out how to import it? How would we get it into unity

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,930
Well let's take a look I'm gonna do that
with my chosen asset right now so

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,760
import new asset, I've got this glitch
PNGs folder here and I've still got a

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,629
bunch of things I'm interested in using,
foxes and all the rest of it and one of

00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,890
these guys is a deimaginator and he has
an appear animation so let's use that.

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,030
So when your spreadsheet first comes in
it's just gonna be treated as a single

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,859
sprite and it isn't a single sprite so
we need to go up to the inspector, make

00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:02,660
sure that the texture type is sprite, and
then that the sprite mode is multiple.

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,099
Now click sprite editor and you'll open
up something like this. Now how we gonna

00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,930
get all these guys out we don't do it
manually so that's actually a slice

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,940
option at the top left and we can go to
grid. And it's going to say what's the

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,049
pixel size of these boxes? Well, good
question, you've got to go work that out

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,590
So how are you going to work it out?

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,799
Well here's the basic formula for
working it out, what we want to do is,

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,440
assuming there's no padding and grid
sheets normally have no padding then the

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,489
width is the image width divided by the
columns and the height is the image

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,260
height divided by the rows.

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,940
So what does that actually mean? Well
let's look at this image; I'll look at it in

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:49,349
my system, whatever your default image
editor is, and go to the inspector on the Mac

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,919
or if you're on a PC just ask your image
editor what size is this sheet and

00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,410
it's saying it's 753 by 1674 pixels, so
what I tend to do he was just open up a

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,349
calculator and then have this image size
visible on the screen

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:10,450
753 divided by one, two three columns

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:19,450
251. so it's 251 pixels wide, I'll just keep a note of
that for the moment 251 and then what is

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:34,200
the height 1674 divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 so
1674 over 9... 186. 251 / 186 so over in your

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:45,550
sprite editor slice grid 251, 186, slice
and they've laid their sheet out in a nice way

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,180
so look it's perfect, if we scroll in each
frame is its own box, and yes the guy

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,910
moves to the left but he's supposed to, he's
jumping into the scene, there's no padding, it

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,180
all works just fine, click Apply; and then
close your sprite editor. Now, let's take a look

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,240
what've we got here? Look at that, when you click the
little arrow every frame of this

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,600
animation is separately now shown when
you unpack that sprite like that, isn't that

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,419
cool? I think it is, so that's how you
work it out, you just basically say how

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,190
many are there wide, how many are there high and do the division. Pretty simple, so what I want

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,880
you to do now is pause the video
Find yourself a sprite

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,340
sheet it doesn't have to be the one I've
used, it doesn't even have to be from

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,850
Glitch it can be from anywhere, and calculate
your own grid width and height and import and slice your

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,600
own sprite sheet. So go ahead, pause the video and do that now please.

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,750
OK, so now you've got all the frames of
animation set up I bet just dying to

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,210
make this little guy move. Me too. Some of
you may already know there's a shortcut

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,680
to this which is to select all of these
frames and drag them into the hier archy

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,919
but don't do that because it just does
too much in one go and you won't have

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,710
the basic understanding plus it tends to
mess things up a little bit in terms of

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,060
where everything where everything sits
and how things are related you can do

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,490
that later once you understand what's
going on but let me take you through the

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,180
first principles first OK, of how we're gonna set
this up. So what we need to do first is

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,240
say well we need a  game object, so let's
just have an empty GameObject, let's

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,450
call it lizard and let's just leave him where
he is. Now don't worry about how these

00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:20,070
things sit relative to the game space at
all, in fact in this video we are

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,990
not going to make these sprites sit
properly on the game space, we need to

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,730
make a serious change to the level
camvas shortly, as you'll see. So I'm just going

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,730
to put my lizard GameObject at the
origin like that and then double click

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,830
on it to frame it

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,380
fantastic so let's take one of these
frames and use that as the avatar

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,950
for the animation it would be helpful to
use a frame where you can kind of see

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,180
what's going on; so the last frame's not
particularly helpful, the first frame is

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,830
not particularly helpful, typically
something in the middle is quite helpful

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:56,220
Here if you drag that onto your lizard,
then look and see what's happened it's

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,710
actually created a new object with a
sprite renderer so one way of doing it

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,860
but it's pretty messy cuz you got a new
sub-object on your lizard there, so I would

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:14,110
prefer that you went to your lizard and
manually just add a sprite renderer so we

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,410
know what we're doing, then grab a
frame, a single sprite, drop it onto the

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,400
sprite renderer and double click the lizard to
frame it, don't worry about the fact he's

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,380
crazy scale compared to the background
move it away from the background if you

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,670
wish, there he is OK, so there you just
have a lizard which only has a sprite

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,120
renderer with one of these sprites on it.

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,210
Fantastic, that is a great starting point,
so what comes next?

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:45,960
Well next we need to add an animator so if we go
to the component menu and have a look

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,910
through and see what we've got, and you start
typing anima- you're gonna get animation

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,260
and animator. we want the animator. The animation

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,630
system is being phased out. So
use the animator. So now you've got an

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,960
animator. We'll do absolutely nothing
quite yet, because what you need is an

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,460
animation controller next, so let's
collapse down our sprite, make ourselves a

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,680
folder called animations

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,639
go into it and then go to assets or
right-click in here and say create

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,669
animation controller and it's an
animation controller for the lizard

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,350
there we are now if you double-click
into that, what have we got? We have any

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,690
state at the moment, that's it. It just has a...
no animation states, I'll explain that

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,510
in a moment.

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,700
Pop back to your lizard. Now if you
click on your lizard, where it's asking

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,690
for an animation controller you can now
drag your new blank animation controller

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,390
in to him. OK, that's fantastic.

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,760
Now what we need to do is we need to
create an animation state, and that's

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,250
going to be his appearing in the scene
state. At the moment there are no states

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,880
Firstly I want to reorganize my workspace I'm
going to put my animator down the

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,800
bottom which is my state diagram in
future this will go from any state to

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,140
appear to walking to attacking to
walking again. It's going to be that kind

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,810
of loop as you saw in lazer defender and
at the top I'm gonna create a new

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,089
window which is my animation window I'm
going to dock that up next to game. So this new

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:23,279
layout here I may as well save, right? Save
layout and call it

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,120
animation and if you want a different
layout of windows, knock yourself out. You

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,610
have multiple screens, do what you like.
This is how I need to do it for this

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,250
recording. Great, so let's recap we've got a
lizard with a sprite renderer,

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:42,800
one of the frames just as a placeholder
and an animation with this animation controller on

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,350
it. Now we need to actually add an
animation clip, which is the thing that

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,000
makes him move, you click on the lizard
first, very important. In the

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,150
animation window click this little drop
down here and then you'll see create new

00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:03,230
clip. You see that? It's actually an unlabeled drop
down. Right once you click on Create new

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,820
clip this is where it says create new
animation for the game object lizard, fine

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,700
let's do that let's call it

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:17,240
lizard appearing. That's very simple and we have a
state called lizard appearing, its orange

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,160
which means it's the default state

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,230
and we have a line in our animation for
this clip. We are nearly there

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:31,009
we've nearly created ourselves an animation.
So, go back to your images, open up your

00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:38,060
dude, select all of his animation frames
and drop them, like so, onto the animation.

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:44,279
You can see in the animation timeline a tiny
indication of of the animation playing

00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,300
through in time. In fact if you scroll
your mouse wheel you can zoom in and pan

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,649
and you can see all of the frames.
Fantastic, it's not actually jumping to the

00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,800
right it's just that it's showing one
frame after the other

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,759
now at the moment you have probably come
by default into animation recording mode

00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,329
you see there's a record button here and
all of the play pause and next step but tons

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,009
have gone red, that's 'cause the
animator's now expecting you to start

00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:15,370
playing with the animation in the scene
view and recording what we call

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,560
key frames but we're not going to be
doing that quite yet so come out of

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,860
recording mode by clicking the record
button, now your red play is no longer

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,970
a play. Now I just want to preview the
animation to finish this video so how are we

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,139
gonna preview the animation? Click on the
animator and then on your lizard

00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,889
and click play

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:43,800
let's just take a look, go back to the scene
view... there he is, he's jumping. So in the scene

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,120
view if you frame on your lizard and you
can see in the animation state

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,699
Controller you see it's looping around
jump jump jump jump fantastic. There's

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:56,029
another way to preview this guy as well,
you can stop playing - you don't even have

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,079
to be in play mode - double-click
lizard appearing and you should at the bottom of your

00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,589
inspector, once you've double-click that
state, have a preview panel; if you don't

00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,680
you'll be able to bring it up from the bottom.
Now it's gonna say no model is available

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,309
for the preview, well give it a model,
drag the lizard on. OK, now it's almost uselessly

00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:19,309
small but preview it and then you can
use the right mouse button drag to turn

00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:24,089
it round, look from either side, there you go,
you can see the preview now why is it so

00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,540
damn fast? Well,

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,480
this speed here is the speed of the
preview, the speed I'm changing in the

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,459
inspector. That's not going to indicate
how fast it's actually gonna run the

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:39,769
reason it's too fast is this setting up
here . At the top of our animation window

00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:45,120
we have sixty samples which means it's
assuming this animation was drawn at 60

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,589
frames or samples a second. Well let's change
that down to maybe twelve, and you can

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:53,790
immediately see the effect in the
preview window down the bottom right

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,949
here he's now jumping in too slowly I
would say, that looks a bit silly so

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:01,040
let's just change the samples up until
it looks right.

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,029
Ideally would ask your artist how fast
it should be, 24 frames maybe try 30, now here

00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:12,750
we're just gonna have to pick something that
you think looks good but I think 30

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,550
frame animations will look fine, it looks
like this is set up to be around about

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,980
that. Now because you change the samples per
second here in your animation, when you

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,670
go back to the scene and play - you'll have to go
back to scene of course, there you go -

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,380
his speed has changed and you're looping
around the lizard appearing animation

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,980
state. Before you run off and create too
many animations like this just hold your

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,579
horses a moment and wait a few videos
because I'm going to show you that we

00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:41,850
actually need to structure both our
animator and our sprite a little bit

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,500
differently in this game to get the
flexibility we need, so just create this

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,250
single animation for now and we will add
the others

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,010
a little bit later with my guidance. So to recap,
this is how you do it

00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:00,010
You create an empty GameObject, you drag one of
the sprites on as a placeholder better to

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,720
actually add a sprite renderer and drag
the sprite to the sprite renderer

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,829
add an animator - animations are being
phased out - go into to the animation window

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:11,860
and then create a new clip and go from
there

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,130
Fantastic, remember this slide is
available for you, all of the slides are

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,870
available at the start of the section,
just download them under your section

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,880
notes, now it's time for you to make your
animation. Make and preview your own; make

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,540
sure the frame rate, the samples is
correct and don't worry about it fitting

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,139
in the game window for now, it will not
sit properly on this level canvas because our level

00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,870
canvas is not set up right right now.

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,860
See you soon.
