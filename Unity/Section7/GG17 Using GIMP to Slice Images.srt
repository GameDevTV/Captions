00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,140
So before we go on to any more
animations that are based on sprite

00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,809
movement like this little lizard guy i
wanna talk about another type of

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,740
animation and that's bone based animation,
and then once we've done that we can get

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,730
all of our animations done in one go
regardless of whether they're gonna be sprite

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,360
or bone based. So what are we gonna do this
video? We're gonna introduce them based

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,609
animation briefly, use GIMP on a Mac or
PC to slice the images, but the

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,649
principles that I show you will apply to
any other image editor and then I'll

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:39,039
show you how to import those new
sprite sheet and set pivot points. So

00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,239
let's take a look at what we mean by
bone based animation just to give you

00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,379
the context if you go to Google Images
and type dragon bones you'll get... well I

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:52,539
get these images. So this dragon dude
here, sitting on a transparent background

00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:59,869
is a composite of all these bits and
pieces there and what bone animation

00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:04,120
means is you make him move by putting these
all back together and then moving them

00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,080
and pivoting them relative to one
another; let's look at the end result of

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,390
that. Go to dragon bones dot effecthub dot com,
here and if you go to demos there they have

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,930
have some flash demos or  -here you go, let's have a look

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:25,270
take a look at, say... what's one that I know's going to
work? This one here - dragon chases

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,370
starling alright? So have a look at how
he's moving. The different parts that you

00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,060
saw separately before I now just
pivoting the top of the arm, the bottom

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,000
of the arm, the tail even gives a nice
movement effect but it's really just a

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,130
solid tail that's pivoting at his bottom
and at the tip. The hairs are moving. So that's what

00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,950
we mean by bone based animation you can
see actually that there's not a single

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,480
requirement to draw any body part more
than once. All that goes into making that

00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,620
is - let's just take another look now you've seen it
moving - is these pieces. They've been

00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,590
separated out on the page here so that
they can be sliced

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,450
as a multiple sprite when you import
them and then re- composited back into

00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,180
something like this and then in the
hierarchy it's all been arranged together so

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,519
that you can remove these pieces around
pivot points. So a completely and

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,470
fundamentally different way of animating.
So perhaps you're the sort of person, or

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,790
you have an artist that's great at drawing
a one off, but really not so sure about

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,599
animating the frames in between this is
a whole new approach. So how are we gonna do

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,730
this? Let's just take an overview from
the slide first, we're go into GIMP and

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,180
do the following we're gonna take our
sunflower in my case, make the canvas

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,599
bigger mess around with some stuff in
GIMP and then export it again with the

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,829
gap between the flowers and the base. So
let's just get on with it. But the first thing

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:51,950
you're gonna need is something to slice
up or a bone sheet, you could maybe use

00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,599
the dragon bones why not go ahead and
put dragon bones into your game and make

00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,650
one of your attackers maybe turn my
whole game around maybe one of your

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,780
attackers a dragon bones but I'm going
to use the star trophy cuz I seriously

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,769
lack in imagination. So what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna importing a new asset, I'm gonna go

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,160
and find the glitch garden PNGs which I
have in a folder over here somewhere

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,480
Glitch PNGs and one of those is a
star trophy, it should be starred at the top I may need to

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,079
sort by my starred things... so here
we go

00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,880
and somewhere in here we have the cactuses
and the trophy and the rest of it and

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,340
that's the guy. OK so we have a trophy,
and what I want to do is I want to make

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,150
this trophy pivot. I want the star - the sunny
bit at the top to rock left and

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:47,079
right and then I want it to emit stars.
Stars'll be our equivalent of suns. Alright so

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:57,000
let's open this guy here, let's reveal him
in finder and then open him in GIMP.

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,660
There we go, GIMP's going to

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,400
take a moment to open, if you haven't got
GIMP then you can get GIMP from GIMP.org

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,260
and let me show you that, make sure
you're familiar. You may have already got

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,080
to it in the course, you may be using
Photoshop, absolutely fine, you may want

00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,330
to use any other image editor that
supports resizing of the canvas and also

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,070
needs to support exporting of
transparent background so this is the

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,460
site for GIMP.org, there's a video earlier in the
course, just search the course contents

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,250
for GIMP

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,960
and you'll find another primer video on
GIMP in the Block Breaker section.

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,150
Alright, so once you've got this image
inside of GIMP then we just need to do a

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,090
few simple things, let's look at the
instructions and walk you through. So

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,910
image canvas size increase by two
pixels vertically; I want to split the

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,730
top of this guy from the bottom so
firstly I'm going to zoom in a little

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:54,830
bit which is plus; on my keyboard Shift +
OK so image canvas size 38 pixels wide

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,960
by 60 high you wanna un-break this chain;
we don't want to lock the aspect ratio;

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,800
we want to increase this height by two pixels
without increasing the width. OK so I'm

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,990
making mine 38 by 62 but whichever direction
you're splitting your thing in you may be

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,430
giver yourself tons more space to start
with, but have a canvas that's big enough

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,070
Right. Now

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,660
second instruction on GIMP there's an
annoyance, which could really annoy you

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,169
if I didn't tell you this bit. You need to go layer / layer
to image size, otherwise you won't be able to make

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,880
this yellow box any bigger and if you
don't make the yellow box any bigger you

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,700
won't be able to move the base or paste
anything below the yellow line. So you

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,650
need to go layer / layer to image size, you need
to set this front layer to the size of

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,860
the entire image. That's cool. So now you've
got yellow box the size of the image you

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,020
go tools / selection tools / rectangle
select, simple enough. Tools selection tools and

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,100
rectangle select. Fine, now just draw
yourself a rough, rough area I'm leaving

00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,810
two pixels at the bottom because I want
to be taking this, chopping it about here, going

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,230
control X, going down a couple of pixels,
control or command V. That is it

00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,220
actually we can deselect, we can select
none if you want.

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,760
Select all or deselect all but doesn't
matter to be honest because it's done

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,080
There it is, you have a top and a bottom and a gap,
which is going to allow us to slice in

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,950
Unity. So what was the final instruction? It was
cut and paste two lower which we've done,

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,180
Save as a PNG in your unity assets folder, well let's do it.

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,490
Export as; and then we have lizard, we
have this trophy emblem so let's

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,390
just call it

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:47,030
trophy cut because it's been... well... cut dot PNG, let's
try that. Gonna leave the default settings in

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,510
here, go

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,700
back into unity, and here we have trophy
cut. Now, select that and make it a

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,820
multiple sprite cos we're actually gonna
split this into two; gonna ditch my other hole emblem

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,980
by the way, so there's no confusion.
I bet I'll regret this later I bet I end

00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,890
up needing it later, but never mind, I will
do something about that when I get to it. So, trophy cut.

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:14,550
now it's a multiple sprite; so go to your sprite editor.
If you go to your slicing tool automatic

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,310
slicing will work, let's look what it's done.
It's put one area there, and one there.

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,530
The only thing you need to think about is the
base we're not gonna move, well I'm not

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,180
going to move, I'm not going to rotate it, if I did
rotate it I would probably want it to

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,960
rotate around the center but I don't
care, I'm not rotating it. However I am

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,590
gonna be rotating the top bit but not around
the center of the top bit, that would look

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,040
weird right if it rotates around the
centre it'd be kind of... I don't know,

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,310
but not the right thing. So what I'm
going to do is put this bottom here, not

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,870
necessarily bottom centre, it'll snap to a
bottom center but actually bottom center

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,750
looks like it's going to work fine, so
this becomes the pivot point right and

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,790
then let's just call these parts

00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:02,830
trophy top and then I'm gonna name the other
bit trophy base. We have a single sprite

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,970
sheet with 2 sprites in it

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,330
trophy top and trophy base. Apply and
come out of the sprite editor. There you go,

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:15,610
trophy base, trophy top. Fantastic so now
what we can do in the scene is we can

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,960
create ourselves an

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,319
empty GameObject; I'm going to call it
star trophy like so; I'm gonna give a zero

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,860
transform for now, and then what I can
do with this star trophy is I can

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,149
actually have two sub-objects in there, two

00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:38,380
child objects, the top and the base this
is how you want to do it not like that

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:45,089
but at the same level in the hierarchy.
OK and I'm simply gonna call them top and

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,959
base and then you put the sprites on
them. Right so I put the base on the base,

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,420
just drag it in, but if you drag it in
it's gonna see the effect of dragging it

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,029
in? that's a valid way of doing it but you
gonna create duplicate objects which is

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:05,200
absolutely fine or your alternative to
doing that of course telling you to suck

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,940
eggs at this stage in the course, is on
the top here you can add a component

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,040
sprite renderer, but I wanna make sure you're
remembering what all this stuff is doing,

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,730
take the trophy top and just pop it on
there like that. So you have the base and

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,050
the top. So where is this star trophy in
the scene? Let's make sure that the

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,220
sprite renderers both have an order in
layer of one so that we can see things

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,329
So what's happened here is the
top is in one place and the base is in

00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:39,700
another, so let's just reset the transform of
the top, and it's not the top itself it's

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,050
the star trophy that has the problem and
therefore the base has a problem you see

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,180
how important it is to think about the
relative positions here we go, we're nearly

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,050
there, if we double-click on star trophy
the only trouble we have is I'm a bit OCD

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,980
and like to have top above base even
in the hierarchy, I'm also a bit OCD and

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,329
like to name them consistently, so let's
do that, and finally I just wanna move

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,440
the top up; and you get them up, obviously there's a point at which they gonna look exactly like they

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,010
did let's see how that looks, there's still
a gap, so just going to move the top

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,430
down a touch. So we're not actually going to animate it in this video, I just wanna get you to the point that you

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,370
could animate it, it just means nudging this
down a couple more pixels, fantastic so

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,240
now you have an object that if you
correctly

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,240
apply an animator to your going to be able
to independently control the rotation and

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,110
translation and scaling of the top and
the base. Now hold your horses don't go

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,790
away and try and animate everything like crazy
yet because I've still got to do a similar thing

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,870
thing with you with lizard, we need to pull its
sprite out into a sub-object, to do various

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,839
other things but i just want to show you
that this is the end point we want you

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,339
to get to which is basically a long way
of just ending up with a star trophy in

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,640
the scene but the difference is you now
have control over it cuz you have two

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,779
separate objects with pivot points, we
could rotate this top piece in the animator.

00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,589
So what I want you to go ahead and do
now then is do this for all of your

00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:04,480
animations that you're gonna do bone
animation on. So create at least one

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,810
sprite sheet for bone animation, make sure
there's a picture or two

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,220
gap around all your limbs; I'm using limbs
kind of in quotes; export with a

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,690
transparent background, import into
unity as a multiple sprite as I just

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,610
showed you and set pivot points around
the points that you want these things to pivot and rotate.
