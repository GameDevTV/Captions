00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.449 align:middle line:90%
Hey guys. welcome back. So in this video we're
going to set up our actual levels. So what

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:14.320 align:middle line:90%
we have at the moment is just a win button
and a lose button loosely slapped down but

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.869 align:middle line:90%
we need to think about the canvas for our
actual levels. So if you remember our splash

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:90%
screen. that was a canvas of screen match
mode type shrink if you look at the canvas

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.789 align:middle line:90%
scaler of your canvas on your splash screen
it's screen match mode is shrink. which means

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:90%
that the canvas shrinks as teh game window
changes size.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:90%
That has the following effect: it means that
when your aspect ratio gets squarer. so say

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:90%
we go from the 16:9 the big box you can see
down to the 4:3. the iPad style resolution

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:90%
we lose the edges. and we talked about the
edges being a quiet zone. and that being OK

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:90%
on this image. because there's nothing particularly
interesting happening and you don't really

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:90%
notice you've lost it; but this is what we
want for our game as well. We actually want

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:90%
for our level to have all the important gameplay
elements in the centre here. and then anything

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.969 align:middle line:90%
that's irrelevant to the gameplay on the the
outside.

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:90%
So firstly. we're going to need a grass texture
so let's go and grab ourselves a grass texture.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.909 align:middle line:90%
It's in the asset pack for this section. I
found it on the web. made a little bit of

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.479 align:middle line:90%
a modification to it and there it is. So pop
your grass tile into your images folder but

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.359 align:middle line:90%
crucially set your sprite mode - sorry the
texture type to texture up here in the inspector.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.929 align:middle line:90%
not to a sprite; because we want this thing
to repeat. So all the other default options

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.369 align:middle line:84%
should be fine. and click apply.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.429 align:middle line:90%
So now you actually have a texture in here
rather than a sprite. Fantastic. I think that

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.109 align:middle line:90%
this is the first time that you've probably
used a texture. Now lets go into the level

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.909 align:middle line:90%
one scene. Now. what do we want to add to
use this? Well. click on the canvas and add

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.469 align:middle line:90%
yourself a UI raw image rather than an image.
What's the difference? Well. you can click

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.489 align:middle line:90%
on the book and it will tell you. take you
to the docs. but basically it takes in a texture.

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:04.889 align:middle line:90%
That's the main thing. and it's better for
static images.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:90%
So if you pop the grass texture on there then
look what we have a little grass element.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Now before I do anything else I'm going to
reset the rect transform for this guy. we

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:90%
had so much trouble before; and I'm also going
to set the width and height to 1600... and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.829 align:middle line:90%
not 16 million. or whatever that is. 1600.
struggling because the microphone is between

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
my face and the keyboard. There you go. 1600
by 900. great.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:90%
So that is our target size. that's fine. raw
image is not particularly useful. let's call

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.069 align:middle line:90%
it grass. just grass and I'm going to put
it at the top of our canvas hierarchy so it's

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:90%
behind the text. Now that it's where it is
we can see that our text is no longer on the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:90%
playing field so let's bring it in. let's
bring it even further remember that at 4:3

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.829 align:middle line:90%
we still want t be able to see it. How do
we check that? Well we go over to game. we

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:90%
set the aspect to 4:3 and make sure that we
can still see these things. Fine.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Alright so where's the canvas mode here? It's
on expand. we want it on shrink. Set it to

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.579 align:middle line:90%
shrink. Better. Now. as you go from 4:3 to
16:9 you just lose the edges you see? So.

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.469 align:middle line:90%
finally we need to tweak in the win condition
and the lose condition. Now if you want to

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:90%
see them together you can detach your game
and have it next to the scene like this. you

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.749 align:middle line:90%
may have a lot more room on your screen. I'm
very small here because of the screen resolution

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:29.909 align:middle line:84%
that I'm using for recording.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Great. so now we can see the direct effect.
Great so as our aspect ratio for our device

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:90%
gets wider. and it introduces more information
left and right but the core of the game is

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.889 align:middle line:90%
4:3 is what we're going to be targetting.
So in the rest of the video we are going to:

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.319 align:middle line:90%
well. we've covered the screen match mode.
We've covered the raw image and grass texture.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.099 align:middle line:90%
I've talked to you about quiet zones so now
I want you to set up the level with prefabs.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:90%
So I need you to scale. find out how to scale
that; or tile rather. that grass texture image

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:90%
so that we have at least five rows and nine
columns at 4:3.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Make it fill the screen. we've kind of done
that. then once you're happy with your canvas.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:90%
once you're happy that you've got at least
five rows and nine columns at 4:3 I want you

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.419 align:middle line:90%
to prefab the whole canvas and then replace
the canvasses on all three levels with the

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
prefabbed version. Now if we need to update
this first later then we can. by just changing

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:90%
the prefab. Just check that it all scales
properly with the game window and flows through.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Have a go at that now.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Great. so the option that you're looking for
to make this grass scale is here. Let me just

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.699 align:middle line:90%
go back to default layout. OK fine. Get my
canvas focussed and this is the option you're

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:90%
looking for. go into the canvas. into the
grass and then it's width height here. You

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:90%
can adjust these until you get what you need.
We need nine columns at 4:3. So actually maybe

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:90%
I am better with my game detached so that
I can see what I'm getting. Aspect 4:3 and

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:90%
keep changing the width until you get the
nine columns you're after 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%
7. 8. 9 there's the nine at six we get nine
that's OK we may want to change that later.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:90%
no we need five high. we've only got three
high. so let's see where we go there.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:90%
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6 high. so maybe 3... 5 that's
OK there. Alright. that's OK. and we've still

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:90%
got room along the bottom and the top for
a little bit of user interface so we have

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:90%
our nine by five and a little bit of space
top and bottom for user interface. So that's

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:00.699 align:middle line:90%
fine I've got UV rect settings of six and
three there. That's absolutely fine. that's

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:90%
good news. So. what next? Well. the next thing
I'm seeing that I don't really like is that

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:90%
there's a slight break in this texture. can
you see that there's a little horizontal line?

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.389 align:middle line:84%
just a little thin horizontal line?

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.699 align:middle line:90%
Well that's because my image has got a little
bit of mess on the bottom of it. If you go

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.169 align:middle line:90%
into your favourite image editing program
- I'm going to use Preview but you might want

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:90%
to use GIMP or some other PC program. All
I want you to do in your image is simply crop

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.039 align:middle line:90%
the bottom pixel. The bottom single pixel
off that image. I'm leaving it this way rather

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:90%
than giving you a perfect image because this
is exactly the sort of thing you're going

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.909 align:middle line:90%
to need to do. I wanted you to see the effect
of having a slightly dodgy image.

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:48.319 align:middle line:90%
OK. so if you do that and you reimport that
image into Unity... actually it's already

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:90%
updated. which is good. You may not need to
reimport depending on where you make your

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.889 align:middle line:90%
edit. If you've right-clicked on it and revealed.
or shown your file then it'll immediately

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:90%
update look you see we don't have this problem
any more because we've taken this bottom pixel

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.479 align:middle line:90%
off OK? And that grass playspace is looking
pretty cool now. Right. now I want to prefab

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:90%
the canvas - the whole canvas is basically
set up how we want it. Prefab it. give it

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.319 align:middle line:90%
a more meaningful name. Level Canvas. Right.
fantastic. and then what we finally want to

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.759 align:middle line:90%
do is go through the levels and make sure
that all levels don't use this dodgy old canvas

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:31.050 align:middle line:90%
they had but they use a nice. prefabbed level
canvas. Spelt correctly. and the great thing

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:90%
about prefabs is that they'll all update when
we make a change.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:90%
So later when we inevitably decide that we
want to tweak our level canvas we only need

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:90%
to tweak the prefab. There it is. just try
renaming it again. Canvas... pefect. Alright.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:90%
so now. if we look through our scenes. start
from the start screen. In fact we can't start

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.439 align:middle line:90%
from the start scene. we must start from splash
so our persistent music comes through properly.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
if we play the game we get to here. lose condition
you moose. rather than lose. back to start

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.699 align:middle line:90%
play game. win condition so that's all fine
and then if we just have a quick preview through

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:18.229 align:middle line:90%
our levels. level one level two. level three.
all our level canvasses are prefabbed so we're

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
in a great state here.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:26.009 align:middle line:90%
Just check that when you detach your win scene
that it works for aspect ratios from 4:3 through

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:31.919 align:middle line:90%
3:2 all the way up to 16:9; and it does. So
we now have a play space that's just begging

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:90%
for us to start sticking some animals and
some plants and just creating a battleground

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:90%
here. so congratulations on getting this far.
the final thing we're going to do in the next

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:90%
video is take a look at making the options
screen actually do something and talk to the

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
=======

00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,449 align:middle line:90%
Hey guys, welcome back. So in this video we're
going to set up our actual levels. So what

00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:14,320 align:middle line:90%
we have at the moment is just a win button
and a lose button loosely slapped down but

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,869 align:middle line:90%
we need to think about the canvas for our
actual levels. So if you remember our splash

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,000 align:middle line:90%
screen, that was a canvas of screen match
mode type shrink if you look at the canvas

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,789 align:middle line:90%
scaler of your canvas on your splash screen
it's screen match mode is shrink, which means

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,180 align:middle line:90%
that the canvas shrinks as teh game window
changes size.

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:40,100 align:middle line:90%
That has the following effect: it means that
when your aspect ratio gets squarer, so say

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,230 align:middle line:90%
we go from the 16:9 the big box you can see
down to the 4:3, the iPad style resolution

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,550 align:middle line:90%
we lose the edges, and we talked about the
edges being a quiet zone, and that being OK

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,270 align:middle line:90%
on this image, because there's nothing particularly
interesting happening and you don't really

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,430 align:middle line:90%
notice you've lost it; but this is what we
want for our game as well. We actually want

00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,180 align:middle line:90%
for our level to have all the important gameplay
elements in the centre here, and then anything

00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,969 align:middle line:90%
that's irrelevant to the gameplay on the the
outside.

00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:12,630 align:middle line:90%
So firstly, we're going to need a grass texture
so let's go and grab ourselves a grass texture.

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,909 align:middle line:90%
It's in the asset pack for this section, I
found it on the web, made a little bit of

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,479 align:middle line:90%
a modification to it and there it is. So pop
your grass tile into your images folder but

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,359 align:middle line:90%
crucially set your sprite mode - sorry the
texture type to texture up here in the inspector,

00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,929 align:middle line:90%
not to a sprite; because we want this thing
to repeat. So all the other default options

00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:36,369 align:middle line:84%
should be fine, and click apply.

00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:40,429 align:middle line:90%
So now you actually have a texture in here
rather than a sprite. Fantastic. I think that

00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:45,109 align:middle line:90%
this is the first time that you've probably
used a texture. Now lets go into the level

00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:50,909 align:middle line:90%
one scene. Now, what do we want to add to
use this? Well, click on the canvas and add

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,469 align:middle line:90%
yourself a UI raw image rather than an image.
What's the difference? Well, you can click

00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:00,489 align:middle line:90%
on the book and it will tell you, take you

00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:04,889 align:middle line:90%
That's the main thing, and it's better for
static images.

00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:10,590 align:middle line:90%
So if you pop the grass texture on there then
look what we have a little grass element.

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,030 align:middle line:90%
Now before I do anything else I'm going to
reset the rect transform for this guy, we

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,430 align:middle line:90%
had so much trouble before; and I'm also going
to set the width and height to 1600... and

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,829 align:middle line:90%
not 16 million, or whatever that is. 1600,
struggling because the microphone is between

00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,950 align:middle line:90%
my face and the keyboard. There you go. 1600
by 900, great.

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,420 align:middle line:90%
So that is our target size, that's fine, raw
image is not particularly useful, let's call

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,069 align:middle line:90%
it grass, just grass and I'm going to put
it at the top of our canvas hierarchy so it's

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,930 align:middle line:90%
behind the text. Now that it's where it is
we can see that our text is no longer on the

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,560 align:middle line:90%
playing field so let's bring it in, let's
bring it even further remember that at 4:3

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,829 align:middle line:90%
we still want t be able to see it. How do
we check that? Well we go over to game, we

00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:01,620 align:middle line:90%
set the aspect to 4:3 and make sure that we
can still see these things. Fine.

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,480 align:middle line:90%
Alright so where's the canvas mode here? It's
on expand, we want it on shrink. Set it to

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:15,579 align:middle line:90%
shrink. Better. Now, as you go from 4:3 to
16:9 you just lose the edges you see? So,

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,469 align:middle line:90%
finally we need to tweak in the win condition
and the lose condition. Now if you want to

00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:24,390 align:middle line:90%
see them together you can detach your game
and have it next to the scene like this, you

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,749 align:middle line:90%
may have a lot more room on your screen. I'm
very small here because of the screen resolution

00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:29,909 align:middle line:84%
that I'm using for recording.

00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:35,920 align:middle line:90%
Great, so now we can see the direct effect.
Great so as our aspect ratio for our device

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,680 align:middle line:90%
gets wider, and it introduces more information
left and right but the core of the game is

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,889 align:middle line:90%
4:3 is what we're going to be targetting.
So in the rest of the video we are going to:

00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:56,319 align:middle line:90%
well, we've covered the screen match mode.
We've covered the raw image and grass texture,

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,099 align:middle line:90%
I've talked to you about quiet zones so now
I want you to set up the level with prefabs.

00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:09,060 align:middle line:90%
So I need you to scale, find out how to scale
that; or tile rather, that grass texture image

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,930 align:middle line:90%
so that we have at least five rows and nine
columns at 4:3.

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,180 align:middle line:90%
Make it fill the screen, we've kind of done
that, then once you're happy with your canvas,

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,130 align:middle line:90%
once you're happy that you've got at least
five rows and nine columns at 4:3 I want you

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,419 align:middle line:90%
to prefab the whole canvas and then replace
the canvasses on all three levels with the

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,720 align:middle line:90%
prefabbed version. Now if we need to update
this first later then we can, by just changing

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,970 align:middle line:90%
the prefab. Just check that it all scales
properly with the game window and flows through.

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,400 align:middle line:84%
Have a go at that now.

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,770 align:middle line:90%
Great, so the option that you're looking for
to make this grass scale is here. Let me just

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:56,699 align:middle line:90%
go back to default layout. OK fine. Get my
canvas focussed and this is the option you're

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,500 align:middle line:90%
looking for, go into the canvas, into the
grass and then it's width height here. You

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,710 align:middle line:90%
can adjust these until you get what you need.
We need nine columns at 4:3. So actually maybe

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:17,580 align:middle line:90%
I am better with my game detached so that
I can see what I'm getting. Aspect 4:3 and

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,470 align:middle line:90%
keep changing the width until you get the
nine columns you're after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,990 align:middle line:90%
7, 8, 9 there's the nine at six we get nine
that's OK we may want to change that later,

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,360 align:middle line:90%
no we need five high, we've only got three
high, so let's see where we go there.

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:43,430 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 high, so maybe 3... 5 that's
OK there. Alright, that's OK, and we've still

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,520 align:middle line:90%
got room along the bottom and the top for
a little bit of user interface so we have

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,410 align:middle line:90%
our nine by five and a little bit of space
top and bottom for user interface. So that's

00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:00,699 align:middle line:90%
fine I've got UV rect settings of six and
three there. That's absolutely fine, that's

00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,900 align:middle line:90%
good news. So, what next? Well, the next thing
I'm seeing that I don't really like is that

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,050 align:middle line:90%
there's a slight break in this texture, can
you see that there's a little horizontal line?

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,389 align:middle line:84%
just a little thin horizontal line?

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,699 align:middle line:90%
Well that's because my image has got a little
bit of mess on the bottom of it. If you go

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,169 align:middle line:90%
into your favourite image editing program
- I'm going to use Preview but you might want

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:27,120 align:middle line:90%
to use GIMP or some other PC program. All
I want you to do in your image is simply crop

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,039 align:middle line:90%
the bottom pixel. The bottom single pixel
off that image. I'm leaving it this way rather

00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,610 align:middle line:90%
than giving you a perfect image because this
is exactly the sort of thing you're going

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,909 align:middle line:90%
to need to do, I wanted you to see the effect
of having a slightly dodgy image.

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:48,319 align:middle line:90%
OK, so if you do that and you reimport that
image into Unity... actually it's already

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,080 align:middle line:90%
updated, which is good. You may not need to
reimport depending on where you make your

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,889 align:middle line:90%
edit. If you've right-clicked on it and revealed,
or shown your file then it'll immediately

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:00,060 align:middle line:90%
update look you see we don't have this problem
any more because we've taken this bottom pixel

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,479 align:middle line:90%
off OK? And that grass playspace is looking
pretty cool now. Right, now I want to prefab

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,180 align:middle line:90%
the canvas - the whole canvas is basically
set up how we want it. Prefab it, give it

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,319 align:middle line:90%
a more meaningful name. Level Canvas. Right,
fantastic, and then what we finally want to

00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,759 align:middle line:90%
do is go through the levels and make sure
that all levels don't use this dodgy old canvas

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:31,050 align:middle line:90%
they had but they use a nice, prefabbed level
canvas. Spelt correctly, and the great thing

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,870 align:middle line:90%
about prefabs is that they'll all update when
we make a change.

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,580 align:middle line:90%
So later when we inevitably decide that we
want to tweak our level canvas we only need

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:49,580 align:middle line:90%
to tweak the prefab. There it is, just try
renaming it again. Canvas... pefect. Alright,

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,810 align:middle line:90%
so now, if we look through our scenes, start
from the start screen. In fact we can't start

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,439 align:middle line:90%
from the start scene, we must start from splash
so our persistent music comes through properly,

00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:08,280 align:middle line:90%
if we play the game we get to here, lose condition
you moose, rather than lose, back to start

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,699 align:middle line:90%
play game, win condition so that's all fine
and then if we just have a quick preview through

00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:18,229 align:middle line:90%
our levels, level one level two, level three,
all our level canvasses are prefabbed so we're

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:19,860 align:middle line:84%
in a great state here.

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,009 align:middle line:90%
Just check that when you detach your win scene
that it works for aspect ratios from 4:3 through

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:31,919 align:middle line:90%
3:2 all the way up to 16:9; and it does. So
we now have a play space that's just begging

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,710 align:middle line:90%
for us to start sticking some animals and
some plants and just creating a battleground

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,000 align:middle line:90%
here. so congratulations on getting this far,
the final thing we're going to do in the next

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,030 align:middle line:90%
video is take a look at making the options
screen actually do something and talk to the
