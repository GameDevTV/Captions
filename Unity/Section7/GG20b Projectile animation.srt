00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:07.620
So in this video we're going to give our
projectiles some rotation in the animator.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.710
we're also gonna give them some
translation from the animator.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.420
temporarily. and we're going to see the
combined motion. So let's take a look at

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.150
that. So back over in Unity. firstly a tiny
bit of housekeeping. I've noticed that in my

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.400
cactus animation folder I've got this
core game animator that's created itself

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.029
accidentally created an extra animation
controller so I'm going to get rid of that

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.920
and just check that the cactus still
animates properly. I'm confident he will.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.039
provided I click the right buttons... there he is. he's
happy and hopefully he'll change state there

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:42.609
he goes. Cool.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.609
so that's fine the other thing I've
noticed is that I talked about in that

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.859
sped up video about the naming and of
course my trophy here is just called idle.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.409
it may make sense to call it trophy idle. and
star birth I'm gonna call it

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:04.379
trophy grow... just so that we know
that is the trophy in both cases. OK

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.670
fantastic so let's move on. we need to
get the cactus and the gnome firing

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.170
things; so let's start with the cactus.
what's the cactus gonna fire? Well I'm

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.760
gonna import a new asset and I'm
gonna go to find the Glitch garden .pngs and I'm

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.290
gonna get him firing a zucchini...
or in real language (sorry Americans!) a courgette.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.700
I just never heard of a zucchini until I spent a
few months living in America. but

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.950
apparently a courgette is called a zucchini
over there. So there it is. there is a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.540
zucchini or courgette and it's going to
come flying out of one of our defenders

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.260
which is gonna be a cactus just cos
they're both green. I can't

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.530
give you any more reason than that. So
how are we going to animate this

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.220
thing? How are we gonna have a zucchini
flying off the cactus? Well there's a

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.590
good question. So let's create a child
GameObject for the cactus called

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.890
a courgette. Not sure if it's U - R or just R. Let's just leave it

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.830
like that for now. it doesn't matter. So
it's going to need a sprite renderer. I know anybody who thinks spelling

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.440
matters is going to really hate me right
now I'll check it and change it later if

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.740
it's wrong; so there we have a courgette
sitting in front of the cactus. I'm just

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.640
gonna move it. translate it to the right a
little bit in order to stop it looking

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.440
like it's completely covering the
cactus' face. and then I'm going to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.319
scale it down a little bit like that. OK.
so we have a courgette childed  to the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.440
cactus. so what we want to do is look
at rotating that as it flies off t o the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.739
right so we can actually use the cactus'
animator. that is fine. because we can

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.280
reach through into the courgette to its
transform and we can give it some

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.070
rotation just like we did before. in fact as a
challenge why don't you give it some

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.970
rotation. so just get it rotating get the courgette rotating now. Go on. I'm not going to do it until you've done it...

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.769
Right. so basically at the beginning it has
no rotation. at the end let's say let's

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.180
try minus 359 degrees - I think it's
gonna need to rotate that way. what

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.040
happens?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.310
Absolutely nothing. why? Because that's
the attack state where the rotation is

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.910
happening. there's no rotation in the
other states... that's ok we can just wait

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.480
let's see. so he's sitting in the idle state
cause it doesn't and then when he fires

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.000
the courgette it rotates. OK. it only
rotates once of course. so how would you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.980
sort that out?

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.019
Well. you need to make the rotation loop
but it already is looping - the point

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.030
is he's only rotating while he is in the
attack state. So you could apply the same

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.829
rotation to the idle state if you want
to. So there it is. that's the rotation.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.910
how about translation? How about if we
were to come in here and say actually

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.530
when he fires this thing we want to
translate the transform of the courgette

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.019
not the whole cactus. but of the
courgette. Well then you could do that as

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.450
well. you could say at the end I want
him to be... I don't know 10 squares to the

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.600
right let's try that. So in idle the
courgette's still showing. we'll deal with that in a

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.660
minute they you go. off it goes and it's firing. 
Looks pretty good right? I'm getting a slight

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.790
fuzziness on my courgette and I 
think that's cause of texture compression

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.990
or my low screen resolution but I'm not
worried. OK now how about if we don't

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.120
want the courgette to appear in the idle
state? Well then you've got courgette

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.490
is active and we set this to false

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.690
in both keyframes. let's try it. So in the idle state
there's no courgette and then he fires

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.690
and it comes out. So that's one way of
dealing with it. we're actually going to

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.990
deal with things differently later. we're
going to animate the position of the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.800
projectiles using script. remember we
talked about the different ways of doing

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.100
it in the decisions. but I wanted to show
you that you can animate it this way it's

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.630
just gonna have consequences we don't
want later. but this is an example say

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.050
you wanted a boomerang with a specific
type of animation you could do it like

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.850
this.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.630
The challenge comes with something like
a boomerang. what happens... when do you turn

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.210
it round? If you've got a fixed 10 unit
offset in your animation like we have

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:21.090
here like our transform moves 10 units
in the attack state. here you go. position 10

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.660
units. then what would happen if the
cactus was in the middle of the place?

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.240
It would go right out the game space and back .
so something has to modify the animation.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.010
So either we have a different animation
from every single starting position.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.280
every column. or we actually move it in
script which is what we're gonna do; but

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.340
there's an example. lets do the same thing
for the gnome just so there is an axe in

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.130
the scene. and I'm gonna create the axe
a different way. I'm not gonna create a sub-

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:56.390
object yet. I'm just gonna import
the asset which is a class axe as they

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.490
call it and if I just drag and drop that
on the gnome look what happens. we get nearly

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.860
what we want - apart from it ends up in the 
wrong place so we can reset its transform. that's

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.170
better we can move it away from the
gnome and the other problem is it just

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.240
gives the object a crazy name. let's
just call it an axe. Slightly less crazy now

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.570
and again you can animate the axe in
exactly the same way. let's take a look.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:25.220
Let's go into the gnome. add a curve for... well in
the idle state there is nothing so firstly in

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.150
the idle state we're going to have to make the axe inactive. now bear in mind we're only doing this

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.040
as an example of some

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.150
animator features. I don't suggest it's how
we end up doing it. we'll show you how to

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.720
do it a different way from

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.700
instantiation from script later; but here's
the attacking gnome. he has an axe and we

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.450
want it to do two things we want it to
translate and to rotate the axe. Starting to

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:55.730
get how this animator guy works? I'm going
to zoom in. scroll left and then say what

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.110
rotation do we want? Well let's do a full
rotation by the end of the frame again.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:07.510
359 or minus 359... let's try 359. I'm not sure which
way the axe needs to rotate. We need to wait

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.850
for the animation state to switch is rotating
backwards. No. we want the actual blade

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:18.140
to hit people in the head don't we. because we're psychos. So -359 would be better. OK. now the

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:28.630
translation again let's have him fire it
10 units off; OK. take a look. In the idle state

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.420
the gnome has no axe active and then in the
firing state it goes flying off. Now. massive

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.160
difference in speed between the
projectiles of the gnome and the

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.000
cactus - why is that? Can you think why?
It's because the number of frames of

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.860
animation we have in the gnome compared
to the cactus - the cactus has enough

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.690
animation frames that at 30 frames per
second its loop lasts two and a half

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.060
seconds whereas the gnome is only
lasting a fraction of a second so

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.730
another reason we're going to end up
controlling all this in script. but for now you have

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.870
a pretty good situation. So up next we're
gonna be looking at using the Unity

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.780
remote to start previewing how we're  doing
on the mobile but before we go there I

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.440
need to make you aware of something... this
part of the course you're watching has

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.430
actually been replaced and in order that
the next video on the Unity remote looks

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.030
very similar to what you're seeing here
I've had to go through and change a few

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.070
things. so you are gonna notice a few
things spelt differently. like the star

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.680
trophy may have capitals instead of
lower case. trophy here is purposefully

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.770
misspelled for example you'll also see a
few other little things like the

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:39.290
cactus scale is 1. 1 at this level and
then his body is a different scale

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.450
whereas later in the course we will
actually go through the process

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.670
of getting to that point. so you're gonna
see a few little things. your cactus.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.490
your gravestone scale's going to be
looking similar but achieved a slightly

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.340
different way. a different balance between
the scale of the major transform and its

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.380
child and then just a few differences in
renaming which I've done since I just

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.050
faded out a moment ago I've changed a
few of these assets here to be called

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.880
attack maybe instead of cactus attack
this is all to get us back to a state so

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.440
that the next video you go to should be
very similar to this but you will see

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.420
the odd little glitch from now all the
way through to nearly the end of the

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.040
project you'll just see some minor
differences I'm afraid. but I've done my

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.980
best using our source control system
here to keep track of all the changes

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.390
and to minimize them. Things will be in
slightly different positions and there

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.930
will be just some little oddities where
you think that's not quite what I've got

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.900
in my project. It will only apply to you if
you've been following me through. really

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.070
verbatim. really precisely and it'll also
only apply to you of course if you're

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.290
creating a very similar project. If
you've been doing your own thing you

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.240
won't really notice a difference
hopefully. If you do notice anything

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.880
jarring when you get into the Unity
remote videos. or after please

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.490
immediately post that to the discussions
and we'll look to see what we can do

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.450
about it but hopefully you can look past
any minor changes and keep focusing on

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.930
the learning. so good luck and I'll see you soon.

00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,620
So in this video we're going to give our
projectiles some rotation in the animator,

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,710
we're also gonna give them some
translation from the animator,

00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:18,420
temporarily, and we're going to see the
combined motion. So let's take a look at

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,150
that. So back over in Unity, firstly a tiny
bit of housekeeping. I've noticed that in my

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,400
cactus animation folder I've got this
core game animator that's created itself

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,029
accidentally created an extra animation
controller so I'm going to get rid of that

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,920
and just check that the cactus still
animates properly, I'm confident he will,

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,039
provided I click the right buttons... there he is, he's
happy and hopefully he'll change state there

00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:42,609
he goes. Cool,

00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,609
so that's fine the other thing I've
noticed is that I talked about in that

00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:51,859
sped up video about the naming and of
course my trophy here is just called idle,

00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:56,409
it may make sense to call it trophy idle, and
star birth I'm gonna call it

00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:04,379
trophy grow... just so that we know
that is the trophy in both cases. OK

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,670
fantastic so let's move on, we need to
get the cactus and the gnome firing

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,170
things; so let's start with the cactus,
what's the cactus gonna fire? Well I'm

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:21,760
gonna import a new asset and I'm
gonna go to find the Glitch garden .pngs and I'm

00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,290
gonna get him firing a zucchini...
or in real language (sorry Americans!) a courgette,

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,700
I just never heard of a zucchini until I spent a
few months living in America, but

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,950
apparently a courgette is called a zucchini
over there. So there it is, there is a

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,540
zucchini or courgette and it's going to
come flying out of one of our defenders

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,260
which is gonna be a cactus just cos
they're both green. I can't

00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:50,530
give you any more reason than that. So
how are we going to animate this

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,220
thing? How are we gonna have a zucchini
flying off the cactus? Well there's a

00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,590
good question. So let's create a child
GameObject for the cactus called

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,890
a courgette. Not sure if it's U - R or just R. Let's just leave it

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:13,830
like that for now, it doesn't matter. So
it's going to need a sprite renderer, I know anybody who thinks spelling

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,440
matters is going to really hate me right
now I'll check it and change it later if

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,740
it's wrong; so there we have a courgette
sitting in front of the cactus, I'm just

00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,640
gonna move it, translate it to the right a
little bit in order to stop it looking

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,440
like it's completely covering the
cactus' face, and then I'm going to

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,319
scale it down a little bit like that. OK,
so we have a courgette childed  to the

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,440
cactus, so what we want to do is look
at rotating that as it flies off t o the

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,739
right so we can actually use the cactus'
animator, that is fine, because we can

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,280
reach through into the courgette to its
transform and we can give it some

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,070
rotation just like we did before, in fact as a
challenge why don't you give it some

00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:01,970
rotation, so just get it rotating get the courgette rotating now. Go on, I'm not going to do it until you've done it...

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,769
Right, so basically at the beginning it has
no rotation, at the end let's say let's

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,180
try minus 359 degrees - I think it's
gonna need to rotate that way, what

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,040
happens?

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,310
Absolutely nothing, why? Because that's
the attack state where the rotation is

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,910
happening, there's no rotation in the
other states... that's ok we can just wait

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,480
let's see, so he's sitting in the idle state
cause it doesn't and then when he fires

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,000
the courgette it rotates. OK, it only
rotates once of course, so how would you

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,980
sort that out?

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,019
Well, you need to make the rotation loop
but it already is looping - the point

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,030
is he's only rotating while he is in the
attack state. So you could apply the same

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,829
rotation to the idle state if you want
to. So there it is, that's the rotation,

00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,910
how about translation? How about if we
were to come in here and say actually

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,530
when he fires this thing we want to
translate the transform of the courgette

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,019
not the whole cactus, but of the
courgette. Well then you could do that as

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,450
well, you could say at the end I want
him to be... I don't know 10 squares to the

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,600
right let's try that. So in idle the
courgette's still showing, we'll deal with that in a

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,660
minute they you go, off it goes and it's firing. 
Looks pretty good right? I'm getting a slight

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,790
fuzziness on my courgette and I 
think that's cause of texture compression

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,990
or my low screen resolution but I'm not
worried. OK now how about if we don't

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,120
want the courgette to appear in the idle
state? Well then you've got courgette

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,490
is active and we set this to false

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:40,690
in both keyframes, let's try it. So in the idle state
there's no courgette and then he fires

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,690
and it comes out. So that's one way of
dealing with it, we're actually going to

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,990
deal with things differently later, we're
going to animate the position of the

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,800
projectiles using script, remember we
talked about the different ways of doing

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,100
it in the decisions, but I wanted to show
you that you can animate it this way it's

00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,630
just gonna have consequences we don't
want later, but this is an example say

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,050
you wanted a boomerang with a specific
type of animation you could do it like

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,850
this.

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,630
The challenge comes with something like
a boomerang, what happens... when do you turn

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,210
it round? If you've got a fixed 10 unit
offset in your animation like we have

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:21,090
here like our transform moves 10 units
in the attack state, here you go, position 10

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,660
units, then what would happen if the
cactus was in the middle of the place?

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,240
It would go right out the game space and back ,
so something has to modify the animation.

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,010
So either we have a different animation
from every single starting position,

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,280
every column, or we actually move it in
script which is what we're gonna do; but

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,340
there's an example, lets do the same thing
for the gnome just so there is an axe in

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,130
the scene, and I'm gonna create the axe
a different way, I'm not gonna create a sub-

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:56,390
object yet, I'm just gonna import
the asset which is a class axe as they

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,490
call it and if I just drag and drop that
on the gnome look what happens, we get nearly

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,860
what we want - apart from it ends up in the 
wrong place so we can reset its transform, that's

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,170
better we can move it away from the
gnome and the other problem is it just

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,240
gives the object a crazy name, let's
just call it an axe. Slightly less crazy now

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,570
and again you can animate the axe in
exactly the same way, let's take a look.

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:25,220
Let's go into the gnome, add a curve for... well in
the idle state there is nothing so firstly in

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,150
the idle state we're going to have to make the axe inactive, now bear in mind we're only doing this

00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,040
as an example of some

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,150
animator features, I don't suggest it's how
we end up doing it, we'll show you how to

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,720
do it a different way from

00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,700
instantiation from script later; but here's
the attacking gnome, he has an axe and we

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:47,450
want it to do two things we want it to
translate and to rotate the axe. Starting to

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:55,730
get how this animator guy works? I'm going
to zoom in, scroll left and then say what

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,110
rotation do we want? Well let's do a full
rotation by the end of the frame again,

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:07,510
359 or minus 359... let's try 359, I'm not sure which
way the axe needs to rotate. We need to wait

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,850
for the animation state to switch is rotating
backwards. No, we want the actual blade

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:18,140
to hit people in the head don't we, because we're psychos. So -359 would be better, OK, now the

00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:28,630
translation again let's have him fire it
10 units off; OK, take a look. In the idle state

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,420
the gnome has no axe active and then in the
firing state it goes flying off. Now, massive

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,160
difference in speed between the
projectiles of the gnome and the

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,000
cactus - why is that? Can you think why?
It's because the number of frames of

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,860
animation we have in the gnome compared
to the cactus - the cactus has enough

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,690
animation frames that at 30 frames per
second its loop lasts two and a half

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,060
seconds whereas the gnome is only
lasting a fraction of a second so

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,730
another reason we're going to end up
controlling all this in script, but for now you have

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,870
a pretty good situation. So up next we're
gonna be looking at using the Unity

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,780
remote to start previewing how we're  doing
on the mobile but before we go there I

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,440
need to make you aware of something... this
part of the course you're watching has

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,430
actually been replaced and in order that
the next video on the Unity remote looks

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,030
very similar to what you're seeing here
I've had to go through and change a few

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,070
things, so you are gonna notice a few
things spelt differently, like the star

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,680
trophy may have capitals instead of
lower case, trophy here is purposefully

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,770
misspelled for example you'll also see a
few other little things like the

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,290
cactus scale is 1, 1 at this level and
then his body is a different scale

00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,450
whereas later in the course we will
actually go through the process

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,670
of getting to that point, so you're gonna
see a few little things, your cactus,

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,490
your gravestone scale's going to be
looking similar but achieved a slightly

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,340
different way, a different balance between
the scale of the major transform and its

00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,380
child and then just a few differences in
renaming which I've done since I just

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,050
faded out a moment ago I've changed a
few of these assets here to be called

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,880
attack maybe instead of cactus attack
this is all to get us back to a state so

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,440
that the next video you go to should be
very similar to this but you will see

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,420
the odd little glitch from now all the
way through to nearly the end of the

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,040
project you'll just see some minor
differences I'm afraid, but I've done my

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,980
best using our source control system
here to keep track of all the changes

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,390
and to minimize them. Things will be in
slightly different positions and there

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,930
will be just some little oddities where
you think that's not quite what I've got

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,900
in my project. It will only apply to you if
you've been following me through, really

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,070
verbatim, really precisely and it'll also
only apply to you of course if you're

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,290
creating a very similar project. If
you've been doing your own thing you

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,240
won't really notice a difference
hopefully. If you do notice anything

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,880
jarring when you get into the Unity
remote videos, or after please

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,490
immediately post that to the discussions
and we'll look to see what we can do

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,450
about it but hopefully you can look past
any minor changes and keep focusing on

00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,930
the learning, so good luck and I'll see you soon.
