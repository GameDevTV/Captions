Hi guys and welcome to Glitch Garden. So firstly
thank you to the makers of Glitch which was

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,930 align:middle line:90%
a game that didn't make it to market but they
made all their assets available to it.

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah it's fantastic right everything is available
to us and to you as well to use in your own

00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,329 align:middle line:90%
games if you want to move beyond just the
Glitch Garden for this time.

00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,899 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome because these sprite sheets that
we give you in this game don't take them for

00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:31,680 align:middle line:90%
granted. If you were to try and draw that
hand, you know frame by frame by hand... real

00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,800 align:middle line:90%
hassle so fantastic to have these assets and
animations you know we can focus on the coding

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,180 align:middle line:90%
of it, on the structure, on the patterns so
what are they going to see that's new in Glitch

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,710 align:middle line:84%
Garden

00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,330 align:middle line:90%
So lots of really cool stuff right we've kind
of met the animation framework in Laser Defender

00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:53,370 align:middle line:90%
now it's time to really put it through its paces
and use it to do key frame animation and flipbook

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,610 align:middle line:90%
animation for your sprites so we're going
to show you a lot of things on how to make

00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,329 align:middle line:90%
sprite animations, how to use sprite sheets
to make your characters come to life and because

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,579 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be using professional assets
from the Glitch game they're going to look

00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,600 align:middle line:84%
really sharp.

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,420 align:middle line:90%
So the major the big teacher for this section
is really getting to grips with the animator

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,520 align:middle line:90%
and the other things you're going to learn
- you're going to learn a lot more about how

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,950 align:middle line:90%
to structure a slightly more complicated game;
how we use the component system and how things

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,189 align:middle line:90%
talk to each other and how we need to be careful
about that so we can stay sane and the other

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,219 align:middle line:90%
thing is that it's designed to be deployed
to mobile from the beginning so we straight

00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,179 align:middle line:90%
away start thinking about going to mobile
and we're constantly checking with ourselves

00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:32,499 align:middle line:90%
through the project that it's going to be
suitable for mobile and at the end we'll put

00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:33,389 align:middle line:84%
it on mobile.

00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:36,959 align:middle line:90%
Yeah we definitely want to be building games
for release on a platform so that we can get

00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,359 align:middle line:90%
to our players right our game isn't a game
until its being played and so we now want

00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,030 align:middle line:84%
to get mobile players to play Glitch Garden

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,079 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely and of course it'll deploy to the
web so in the end you'll be sticking it on

00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,869 align:middle line:90%
GameBucket won't you? alright so let's get
stuck in, get it done, I'll be teaching this

00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,509 align:middle line:84%
one so see you soon.

00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:57,509 align:middle line:84%
Good luck and enjoy it.
