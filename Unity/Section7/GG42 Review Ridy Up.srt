00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hi and welcome back! In this video. we're going to do a lot of

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
tidy up. We're going to make a quick change to the logic in the

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Spawner.cs file. We're going to adjust the

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
colliders. so that our attackers actually hit our defenders.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to fix the gravestone animation

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
transitions. so that they are in their under attack state.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
at the right times. And then. we're going to make sure that all our

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
work is properly prefabbed. so we can create other levels.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So. first thing is to look at this

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Spawner.cs Script and see what is up

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with it. Nothing wrong

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
with it. it works. but look at the logic at the bottom here. I

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
ought to be sent to code prison for writing that. because all of

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that can be written in a single line. Can you see what the single line could

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
be? Well. this return

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
true. we're never going to reach return true right. because

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
these two are jointly exhaustive. It's tempting to say

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
mutually exclusive. but I get told off by philosophers when I say that.

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So. they're jointly exhaustive. between them they cover everything.

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but this return true is completely unnecessary. Also. you'll

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
notice that this thing in brackets. either evaluates to

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
true or false. so why don't we just return it.

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Return. I like to use brackets. You don't have to but I prefer to.

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for my logic statement. and just need a semicolon.

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
How's that? return

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Random.value is less than threshold.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It may not read quite as clear. but it's certainly a lot more

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
compact. and I wanted to give you this option where you just return something

29
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that evaluates to a Boolean. Let's make sure it works. before

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I get too excited about my new plan. Always check your plan.

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
because it may seem like a cunning plan. at the time. but may not

32
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
work. So. I've lost so quickly

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
because of the game time. So. I'm going to change my

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
game time. right now. into Level Canvas. onto your

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
slider. Now. I don't think slider is a good name. I think it's not

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
descriptive enough. Something like Game Timer would make

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
more sense. so I'm renaming my Slider object to

38
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Game Timer. I'm also going to. on its script.

39
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
change the default time for this level.

40
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
because it's far far too short. So. where's the script?

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Here it is! Level Seconds. and I'm going to go for 100 seconds.

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now. we're going to have a sensible time. So. let's just check

43
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
nothings broken.

44
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Let's keep going!

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So. hopefully we are now continuing

46
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to record. and I'm just playing to make sure stuff is working.

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So. we have a countdown timer. counting down

48
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
here. and hopefully. in a moment. some

49
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
spawning is going to happen. Here we go! This is just check that. that code

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
changer made to the Spawner. And we've go the parenting. and everything is working

51
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
hunky dory! Fantastic! On to the slide. let's

52
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
see what the next thing to do is. Adjust

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the colliders. so attackers hit defenders. Right.

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
very true. If we look at the game. as it is.

55
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and we place down some stones. for

56
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
example. Now. they're not working! My Defender Prefab Button is not

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
assigned. so let me just fix my buttons. It's simply

58
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a question that the buttons do not have the

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
appropriate prefabs linked to them. The Gnome here is just missing

60
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the Gnome. so let's connect to the Gnome.

61
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The Stone is probably missing the Stone. I don't know when

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
these got disconnected. but if you see something like that. just reconnect

63
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
it. And then. for future. let's also make sure

64
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that we have it prefabbed right. There's your Star

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Trophy! So. all the buttons. it would make sense to prefab

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the buttons. Now. some time I created a Buttons Folder. but we've never used it.

67
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So. I'm going to delete the Buttons Folder under Prefabs.

68
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and just prefabs the button's

69
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
GameObject. which will then come with a bunch of Sub-objects.

70
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so they're all blue now. Eventually. we want to prefab practically everything.

71
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
See the Level Canvas. for example. that's not

72
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
prefabbed either. There is a prefab for it.

73
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
but it's disconnected. because it's black. so let's

74
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
delete the Level Canvas Prefab and re-prefab

75
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
our Level Canvas. This is better. I want practically

76
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
everything to be blue. I don't

77
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
need my placeholder Defenders and Spawners. that are created at run time.

78
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to be blue. but everything else I pretty much

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
want blue. Fantastic! So. let's see if it works now and get onto this

80
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
issue of... Yeah that's cool!

81
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Just going to check all my Defenders.

82
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Fantastic! So. what I want to do is wait till somebody comes along and hits this

83
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
gravestone. and make sure they're actually colliding with

84
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the gravestone. The gravestone animation is wrong. at the moment. That's

85
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
because it's animation state is just not correct right

86
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
now. It is

87
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
just sitting in the Under Attack state. but we'll deal with that in a minute.

88
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
For now. what I'm interested in is. if we were to pause and look

89
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
at this lizard up here. we will find

90
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
that he's not quite touching the gravestone.

91
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
In fact. he's doing quite a good job. right now.

92
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Yeah. he's doing an OK job! Let's take a look at our lizards.

93
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And his

94
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
collider and let's look at the gravestone as well.

95
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So. there's the gravestone's collider

96
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and then. here is the lizard's collider and then there's the

97
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
lizard behind him. Let's see what happens when this lizard behind comes in.

98
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
He stops there. you see. That's

99
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the problem. he's stopping short because of his collider. So.

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
all we need to do is move the lizard's collider. So. stop the

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
game. go to your prefab.

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
in my case. and just make sure that for all your

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
characters. their colliders lead

104
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to a believable sort of behavior. I know it's going to be about a

105
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
third of a block across. just from I.

106
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So. let's just check that this guy appropriately

107
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
stops. when he get to the... Yeah. he

108
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
does. but he chews the back of it and I prefer that he chews the front

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
of it. So. we simply bring the lizard.

110
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
on his body the sprite itself. we

111
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
take the Order in Layer to 2. And now. the lizard will be in

112
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
front of the stone. So. let's just check that the lizard.

113
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
impacting the stone. looks good now!

114
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
There he is! And if we look at it. in the Scene View. we can see he's

115
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
actually making contact with the stone and making it wobble.

116
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
As extra credit. you might want to add a particle effect or something like that.

117
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Fantastic! Now. let's sort out the third thing on

118
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
our list. which is that the... I'm going to

119
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
check the list. [Laughs] Yeah. the gravestone animation transitions. We need to make

120
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
sure that they are working properly. So. what's up with this gravestone

121
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
right now? It's complete rubbish right now.

122
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So. let's have a gravestone. in the scene.

123
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and inspect it and look at its Animator. Now. what's going on

124
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
with this particular gravestone? It's in the Under Attack state. all the

125
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
time. Why? Well. in my case. it's because I just got

126
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
my transition logic wrong. I've got Is Attacking False.

127
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
is taking me to Is Attacking. which is around the wrong way.

128
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But actually. I don't want to be using a ball here at all. I'm going to want

129
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to use a trigger. So. the general architecture

130
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is going to be as follows. When the

131
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
attacker hits the defender's collider.

132
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
it's going to continually call the OnTriggerStay2D

133
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
message. While that's happening. I

134
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
want to keep pushing a trigger into the Attack state. In fact. I'm going to

135
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
swap Idle and Attack around. So. all the time the collision is happening.

136
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I want this transition to happen. from Idle to Attack.

137
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and then. I want it to automatically. at the

138
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
end of the current Attack animation. go back to Idle.

139
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And of course. if we continue to push it. because the collisions keep happening

140
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
or stay in Attack until a collision stops happening.

141
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So. how do we make all that work? We're going to remove the

142
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Is Attacking parameter

143
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
altogether and add a trigger.

144
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And I'm going to call it under

145
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Attack trigger. I like to use the word trigger. so it's really clear

146
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
in the Inspector down here. in the Parameter Inspector. that it's a trigger

147
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
because it looks just like a Bool.

148
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And what I want to happen is. Idle is the default state. that

149
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is the orange. I want to go into Under Attack based

150
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
on the trigger. but I want to come out based on a single

151
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
cycle. an exit time of one loop.

152
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and I leave both of these transitions as Atomic. so

153
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
the animation is complete. We can test it. actually.

154
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
before we go and wire up the code.

155
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
like this. In fact. the code may fail. Let's just look.

156
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The code is OK. which slightly surprises me.

157
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
because I thought that we called that already but maybe we didn't.

158
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So. place yourself a defender down

159
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and inspect it. and of course. it's

160
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
not working. Why not? Why does it keep going

161
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
into this Under Attack state?

162
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Good question! Maybe the code has actually renamed itself.

163
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Let's go and look at the script. for the stone

164
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and see what we've got. Absolutely nothing. so it's not

165
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
the stone. So. before we code anything. we need to work

166
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
out why this guy is

167
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
flitting between states. Even though in his

168
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Animator we have a Default state here and a Transition

169
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
condition of the Under Attack trigger. is not true right now.

170
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
If I set it to True. it stays in Idle.

171
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
See that's a bit weird.

172
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
it's doing the inverse to what you'd expect.

173
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So. let's

174
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Reset this condition. in case there's some bug.

175
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Idle is the default state.

176
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It would change to the Under Attack state. when the

177
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
trigger happens. presumably when it's true.

178
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and then. it will come back after one cycle.

179
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
That all sounds sensible. So. what I need to do is go to Mono

180
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and I need to do a search

181
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
to Find in Files. here.

182
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and I'm going to look for Under Attack.

183
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
in the whole solution.

184
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And it's not there. so it's not code doing this.

185
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So. let's just look again.

186
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
There you go! It's behaving now! Just some

187
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
weird bug. So. I had to just cycle the transition

188
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
in the Animator. So. if I now turn that on.

189
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
it goes into that state. but it comes off

190
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
again. But the OnTriggerStay would have the effect of what I'm

191
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
doing. It'll keep clicking on Attack Trigger and it should work. So. let's

192
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
go and give it a go! Into the Stone Script.

193
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and it's no longer only being used as a

194
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
tag. wer'e actually going to put some behavior in the Stone Script. And

195
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
you can see it coming. can't you? I'm not going to show you how to do this bit.

196
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
OK. so here's your challenge. Write the Stone.cs

197
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Script. When the Attacker is actually colliding

198
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
with the Defender. I want you to continuously set the Under Attacker trigger.

199
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
You're going to need to find the Animator. of course.

200
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Ensure the projectiles don't trigger this.

201
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Check the animation transition happens

202
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
as expected. And

203
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
here's a hint: Use OnTriggerStay2D ().

204
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So. that's the message you're going to want to intercept.

205
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
inside the Stone.cs. So. have a go at that now! And

206
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
see if you can get it so that. when foxes

207
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
jump over the stones or lizards meet the stones in my game.

208
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the stone starts wobbling. and when

209
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
they're no longer under attack. they stand still. or whatever

210
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the equivalent is in your game. Fantastic! So. how are we

211
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
going to make this happen? One of the first things

212
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
we're going to need is a private access to an

213
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Animator.

214
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And as we've done many a time.

215
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
we need to go find that Animator. which should be relatively simple.

216
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well. now where is the Animator? We're on the Stone.

217
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
What method do I use to find the Animator?

218
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Well. if we look at a Stone Prefab.

219
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
the script that we're writing is at the same level.

220
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
it's on the same GameObject as the Animator. so it's a Get

221
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Component call we need here.

222
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Of type Animator.

223
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
method. end line. OK cool! So. we

224
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
have access to an Animator. Now. it's a question of the

225
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
logic. What is the logic by which we decide

226
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
what state we need to be in? So. it's going to be done every frame. We're going

227
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to need to query. every single frame. And then. how are we going to

228
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
do it? Well. we've done this before. When did we do it before? I

229
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
believe it was for the projectiles. They need to decide

230
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
what they're banging into right.

231
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Let's take a look at the Projectile Script. Here we go! And in fact. it's

232
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
exactly this line. where we say Attacker

233
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
attacker = collider.gameObject.GetComponent&lt;Attacker&gt;();

234
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So. these two lines are pretty much exactly

235
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
what are going to want

236
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
to have working. alright. It's just that we're going to be using OnTrigger

237
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Stay. rather than OnTriggerEnter. So.

238
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
let's get the body of it

239
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
there. Instead of OnTriggerEnter it's OnTriggerStay2D.

240
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So. all the time that the collision is happening.

241
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
we find whether or not it's an attacker. We

242
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
say. if it's an (attacker). otherwise it would be null.

243
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Then. what are we going to do? Well. we go animator.set

244
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Trigger. Remember. this only takes one parameter.

245
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and it's called ("underAttack

246
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
trigger"); Now. is that spelling

247
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
perfect? Let's go over to Unity.

248
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and let's check the

249
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Prefab for the Defender.

250
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So. Animator. underAttack trigger.

251
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
If you're not sure. copy and paste it. Make sure you

252
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
don't get it wrong right. OK.

253
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
so if it's an attacker we're collding with. then set

254
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
the trigger. otherwise do nothing.

255
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Maybe that alone would do it? Let's try!

256
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Let's place some defenders.

257
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Yes. some defenders! A whole line of the stones.

258
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Watch this guy. he's shaking! Awesome! And this guy is shaking!

259
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Now. we just need to make sure that

260
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
when the stone dies that it disappears.

261
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and also whether the fox triggers an attack.

262
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Well. that's a game design decision. I don't really mind whether

263
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the fox does or doesn't No. I need to stop this fox.

264
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
because otherwise. the game is going to end before we get to find out what

265
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
happens to our stones. I think the top stone should

266
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
die before anything else. because

267
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
it's being

268
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
chewed by at least two guys right now.

269
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Come on stone! You can always just go...

270
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
When you're play testing like this. you can always just go in and artificially

271
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
remove their

272
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
health. You can just

273
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
reduce the health. OK. didn't really test anything. because the stone disappeared.

274
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Everything is working fine. but our other question is.

275
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
what happens if the

276
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
attacker dies.

277
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
before the defender disappears? So. let's put

278
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
several guns in this lane. This is why I'm doing all of this before play tuning.

279
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
It would actually be difficult during play tuning. And

280
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
let's see what happens to this bottom stone here.

281
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Does it? Yes. it stops! Perfect! Final thing. do these projectiles

282
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
trigger the stone? No! Why not? Well. because the code

283
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
just says. if it's an attacker. otherwise it never sets this trigger.

284
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and then. then Animator is taking care of the rest.

285
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
OnTrigger it's going into the Attack state. After one animation

286
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
it comes back. but if we continually trigger this. it

287
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
appears to stay in the Attack state. So. that's it! We have completed

288
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
the challenge as we wanted.

289
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
basically. Fumbled mouth. So congratulations!

290
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
We've done all the tidy up that I want to do. at this stage. and the game is

291
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
basically working. We just need to play tune it. which is what's up

292
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
next. See you soon!
