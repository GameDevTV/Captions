00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:09.500
So in this video we're actually gonna get our bone
animation working. we're going to make

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.210
the top of the sunflower rotate left and
right so let's get on with it. We have it

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.949
in two pieces already. what we need to do
is set up the animator appropriately. So

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.980
here we have the trophy top and base.
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to add an

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.400
animator to the root object. to the
star trophy itself. because it can

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.989
actually reach in and independently control
the top and the base. OK so we don't have

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.519
an animation controller yet. so let's build
this up from scratch to reinforce

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.280
everything. I'm gonna make a new
animation folder called Star Trophy. it's just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.690
my way of organizing. I'm gonna pop the
trophy cut in there and then I'm gonna

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.559
create myself an animation controller
cuz we gonna need one of them right? I've put

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.050
an underscore because I like it to be
at the start of the folder so it always plays at the

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.020
start of the folder there and then when we go
ahead and look at this star trophy. where

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.550
it says animation controller in the
inspector animator controller we give it

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.210
the new one we've created so we can build
it up bit by bit.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.740
Drop it in there and now we have an
animation controller. fantastic. So let's

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.170
go into the animator and create
ourselves a new clip which will create

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.790
both a animation clip and a animation
state and then we'll be able to actually start

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.850
sticking things in. So let's have an idle
state first. what does the star trophy do when

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.520
it's idle? So there's are idle state. how
many samples the second? Well it doesn't

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.760
have to be consistent with everything
else. let's maybe go for 30 samples that second

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.680
Actually it doesn't matter. this has to do
with the fidelity of your animation. So

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.450
what I want to do is I want to add curve.
Now when you add the curve look

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.150
carefully transform and animator are here
and then top and base are slightly

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.560
indented. they kind of don't look indented
because they're missing their symbols

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.550
but they are the transform applies to
the star trophy itself; whereas the top.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.849
you can independently control the
transform of the top and of the base. so you see

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:11.810
how that works?

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.080
The star trophy's transform. the top's
transform and the base's reflects the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.400
layout of the hierarchy. So in our case
it's the top's transform that we want to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.630
rotate so add that in top transform
rotation. That gives us control over the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.099
rotation of the top. So if we start off with
just something going at one second let's

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.550
just try rotating it at one second to...
I don't know. minus 8 point

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.410
77032 how's that for an arbitrary number

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.660
degrees to the left or right. let's see
what happens there. Now you're gonna need to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.130
focus on your - there you go. look actually
it's to the right so sue me there it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.170
goes and it just but it just snaps back.
If you look at the animator and then you

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.019
click on your star trophy you see how it's in
the idle state but its snapping back to

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.610
the middle but it's working right. So
that's pretty cool.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.130
another way you could have set that
value is to use the record functionality

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.400
here and then to go off into the scene
and actually make the rotation but we

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.410
can kind of see what's going on now
so if I zoom out. if I say that it's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.730
rotated minus eight degrees after
this amount of time. after 30

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.170
frames. then what am I going to do to get it back to the
center? Well I'm gonna need to put

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.780
another key frame in which is this
button here. a little diamond and

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.459
I'm going to need to put that in at an
appropriate time. and an appropriate time would be

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.810
60 frames right? Exactly twice as long. I
want a key frame where the rotation is

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:50.260
zero. Try that. Now let's see what happens as it
loops around. There it goes and at least it goes back to

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.950
the middle and then bounces. So here's a
micro challenge for you. I want you to

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.010
add in another two keyframes after this in
time so that it not only wobbles to the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.340
right and back but it also wobbles to the
left and back to the centre. so we get a

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.850
smooth swaying motion. Go ahead and have
a go at making that smooth swaying motion

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.690
yourself right now.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.590
So to get that full rotation working
what we need to do is say well if it's

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.690
minus a point seven degrees rotation
around the Z axis at 30 frames well then

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.000
let's go to ninety frames there. click a
new keyframe and then put exactly the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.670
opposite in. so one way of doing that by
the way is to click on the frame that

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.110
you want a copy from. you could go copy
component. and then you can go to the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.230
target frame and then paste component
values. Of course you'd have to make the

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.560
negative into a positive. So let's try
that; it's nearly there but of course we need

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.650
to return to centre. so when we look at
the sunflower it's nearly gonna be there but

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.720
it's gonna snap and I've accidentally
done something to the base. It's all about that

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.050
bass. 'bout that bass. So... what have I done
now? I've done something with the Star Trophy

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.890
position by mistake. If you do that. get
an extra curve just delete it. simple.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.970
So let's look at the rotation now just
at the top again. Now what's happening?

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.910
You see. interesting. Now you're seeing
compound animation. You're seeing both

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.720
the whole star trophy and its base being
animated at the same time... and it's top

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.680
being animated at the same time. It's fine.
but it's not what we want right. So again

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.550
we take out the star trophy animation
line; it's a different line to the top

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.919
rotation. that is a completely separate
animation curve. OK so take that one

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:37.650
out and now we're just down to the base
which goes from zero to minus 8.7. to zero. to

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.050
plus 8.7 or it would do had
we pasted onto the right thing. Now all

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.270
of those mistakes have very useful so you see
the sort of common things that can

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.500
happen if you apply your curve to the
wrong object. Nearly there. it's just

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.560
snapping at the end of the animation and
I think you know why. congratulations if

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.340
you did manage to do this yourself by
the way so a hundred and twenty frames in

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.130
we just need to reset to zero. Let's just
check it works. sometimes with this you

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.470
need to reset to like 359 instead of 0 or
something to stop glitching; or to get the

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.430
direction right but this is fine look. here
we go it rocks. I mean it literally rocks and it rocks

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.790
you get the idea

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.330
so we have an idle state so the other
state that we may want to produce for

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.370
this would be a little star who starts
in the middle and then expands over time

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.400
and then pops off and goes up to the top
so let me show you that quickly and then

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.490
I'm going to go into fast motion and
animate all my characters because you

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.450
now have. or you will have all the
fundamentals you need so let's go find a

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:46.650
star. Here we go. star dot PNG  there... So I'm gonna
make a new game object here I 'm gonna make a

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.920
new child object for the star trophy and just call it star

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:58.870
Alright. so there it is then I'm gonna
give that star a sprite renderer and

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.150
attach it or I could have just dragged the star straight to the star trophy and it would have done all of

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.510
that for me. There it is. the challenge is of course
this order. this sort order. this sort

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.780
order business having to constantly set
the sort order - pain in the butt as far as I'm

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.230
concerned. why don't we take our level
canvas and just - if you look at it in 3d

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.160
take the whole level canvas - just move
the guy back a little bit. let's just say

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.680
give you some positive z. So .5 in the Z direction

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.600
OK so just move the level canvas back
away from the camera. so that's setting the

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.230
level canvas's position in Z to
nought point five. Now if we had

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.830
accidentally with our star not bothered
to set the order in layer to one.  left it at zero it'd

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.480
still show. handy tip eh? And it can save you a ton
of time again. As it happens we still do

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.950
need order in layer. in fact we need two. because
we want the star to be on the top this

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.570
time we actually do want it on top of an
existing sprite use the sprite renderer or

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.690
order in layer to order sprite parts on
top of each other.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.540
Don't use it to try and get the sprite
itself above the background. because

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.070
that's just a hassle having to do that
every time. We want by default when you

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.650
drop a sprite down on the background for
it just to work. right? It makes sense to

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:13.700
me and then if you want to if you want
to change the ordering within a sprite

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.370
like we're doing here then you use the
ordering in layers. Anyway. here we go. let's

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:24.620
move this star trophy up a little bit
and then re-scale and after a few

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:30.080
iterations we'll get to a point where we've
got what we want - which is a star that

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.270
sits in the middle of the

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:37.040
trophy and now we can go in and animate
growth and eventual departure of this

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.250
star. so let's take a look at doing that.
We add a curve and and this time we look for

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.170
the star's

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.800
transform but this time instead of
animating either its position or rotation

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:53.380
we're going to animate its scale; and what is the
scale of the star gonna be when the

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.360
trophy is idle and just rocking left and
right? Well you can set the scale to zero.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.240
that is one option. let's just do that and
then I'm going to show you another option to

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.240
achieve exactly the same result. So if we
set the scale of the star to 0 at the

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.940
beginning. and let's just set it say to
what it is at the end. watch what happens -

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:14.790
the star will grow during the idle state. You
see it growing there? It's not moving with it.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.600
you can tell me why in a minute.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.170
do you know why? Why is the star just sitting
there well it's because the star is childed

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.130
to the trophy if you

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.870
childed the star to the top itself
look what happens just by dragging in

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.830
the hierarchy. it now takes its
transform relative to the top... and

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.920
there it goes it rocks away with the top.
So let's watch the animation again. yeah it's

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.260
rocking away with to the top but over in
the animator now the star's scale is no

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.580
longer working properly and has actually
gone yellow. and that yellow means that

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.950
it has nothing to animate and that's
because the star

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.750
object itself has been moved in the
hierarchy so the animator has lost track

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.240
of where it is in the hierarchy. So let me
show you the other way to get the star

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.890
to not be there during the idle phase.
remember at this point we're in the idle state.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.310
So another way to do this would simply be
to go like this; drill through the top on

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.890
here to the star. and that's why I lost
it as it was moved in the hierarchy. and use

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.780
the IsActive method. and you can just
say here in the animator no it's not

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:23.410
active at the start and in the idle
state it's also not active at the end. So

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.440
what happens then we look at it is it's
just it's there the star. ready to go

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.150
ready to animate but it's not active. right?
Great so how about if we were to have

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.640
another clip and let's say it's

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:43.070
what do we call it? Star birth or producing
the star or something like that. I'm

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.560
gonna call it star birth. here we go so we have
a star birth state. and then what's

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.690
going to happen in that star birth state?
Well the very first thing is that we go

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:57.800
drill through the top to the star and
make it active. Tick. fine and then once

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.220
it's active we want it to grow over a
period of maybe four seconds. so add

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.430
another curve to the star itself
transform all the way through to its

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:12.850
scale. now we can control its scale so
at the start we're going to have it's scale 0

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:19.500
and at the end it's going to be this
point two that we've found ourselves - if

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.100
you're not sure go over. use the record mode.
go into the scene and scale the star whilst

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.840
selected on the key frame you want so
select on this key frame. go to the

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.560
scene and then move it how you want it
and then when you come back you'll find

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.570
it will have set these properties. that's what
this red means. that's what the red here

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.340
means - it means it's in record mode. and that's what
the red play. pause. and step means. OK

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.290
so star birth.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:46.750
that's fine. let's think to ourselves
very briefly under what

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.180
circumstances would the star be born? Well
actually it would be born after a

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.960
certain number of loops of the idle
animation. let's say maybe after 5. so after 5 loops a

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.490
star is born. and then if you right click
again on star birth and say make transition.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:07.800
after one cycle of star birth it goes back to
idle. Let's watch this work. Look in the scene

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.640
view. it's going to cycle around idle 5 times
actually it didn't in this case. we'll check

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:18.880
why in a minute but the star birth bit is
working . So idle... ok and the reason is

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.940
it's a very easy on these transition
arrows to not save the value so really

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.960
aggressively hit the enter key and make
sure that value gets saved. and then a

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.780
single iteration of star birth. OK. so they're
your transitions. you're saying do me

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:40.490
the idle animation i.e. the rocking for five
cycles and this is where you adjust how

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.680
often a star trophy actually gives out
star by the way. it's actually a

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.830
play tuning in here

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:51.760
So it rocks a certain number of times
and then eventually the transition will

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.880
happen into star birth. at

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.120
which point it stops moving. the star comes
up and we're nearly there we just want the

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.130
start to float up. ok so how far do we
want it to float up? Well go to the

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.360
star birth thing and let's say at four
seconds. so go and select at four seconds let's

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.600
use - which you can do by just clicking on
a key frame - let's use the this record system so

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.570
make sure you're in record. go to the scene.
and then just do what you want to do to

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:21.950
the star over in the scene it's a core
facility. Just get your star selected. get

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:25.070
your transform tool selected. and say
well after four seconds I want it about

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:30.970
this high. so imagine one of these was in
the top row. it would be one whole square

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.280
up which is perfectly reasonable but
also looking at it like this at this

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.670
zoom level I think to myself actually
I want it bigger. so why not just do it right there.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.290
You can just scale the star however you like here.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.290
Cool. so what that's done back at the
animator is it's recorded those things

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.900
that you've just done into the animator.
just click Play you'll see. So we just wait

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.130
for the transition to happen. there we go.
watch the star - up it comes it comes up

00:13:54.130 --> 00:14:00.010
and expands and then pops - perfect. how
cool is that? We have a star trophy

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:05.600
animation that's working really nicely for
us ok now if you are somebody who likes

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.980
to keep everything in one place and you
don't like the fact that the number of

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.900
cycles of idle before the star gets
released is encoded inside the animator

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.660
here then that's fine. if you want to
have it somewhere else like in a script

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.010
you could just have a script set this
value but we're not doing that for now.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.420
We've got a great result which is that the
star trophy is using bone based animation

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.660
to rock back and forth. to create a star
and the star comes out and floats up to

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.570
the top.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.580
Fantastic. so you have all the building
blocks you need because not only do you

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.920
have that type of animation but of
course if we click over we have a lizard

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.920
here which is completely different; this
guy is a sprite sheet based animation

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:49.750
with multiple states. so pretty cool. I'd
like you to firstly create at least one

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.330
bone based animation for yourself.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.880
OK that's all I want you to do. so at
this stage have already created one

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.769
sprite animation

00:14:57.769 --> 00:15:01.689
in my case the lizard now I want you to
create one bone animation so add life to

00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:05.809
a still sprite. for example a gravestone
or star trophy; move or rotate its

00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:07.439
transform slightly over time;

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:11.800
make the animation loop continuously;
give it at least two animation states as

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.059
we've done there. and then for example that
could be an idle and attacking or

00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:21.249
attacked state. So go ahead and make your
bone animation now. I'm not going to show you

00:15:21.249 --> 00:15:25.939
how because I've just shown you how
with mine. If you want to use exactly the

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:28.910
same asset as I have and follow me through well
you're welcome to rewind. but I really

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.040
would prefer you stop the video and do your
own animation now with reference to what

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.769
I've just done. Cool. congratulations. good luck
with that and I shall see you in the

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.790
next video where we'll talk about
movement and childing in a little bit

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.730
more detail before you then go off and
do all of the animation. See you soon.

Language: en

00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,500
So in this video we're actually gonna get our bone
animation working, we're going to make

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,210
the top of the sunflower rotate left and
right so let's get on with it. We have it

00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:19,949
in two pieces already, what we need to do
is set up the animator appropriately. So

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,980
here we have the trophy top and base.
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to add an

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,400
animator to the root object, to the
star trophy itself, because it can

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,989
actually reach in and independently control
the top and the base. OK so we don't have

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,519
an animation controller yet, so let's build
this up from scratch to reinforce

00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:44,280
everything. I'm gonna make a new
animation folder called Star Trophy, it's just

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,690
my way of organizing. I'm gonna pop the
trophy cut in there and then I'm gonna

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,559
create myself an animation controller
cuz we gonna need one of them right? I've put

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,050
an underscore because I like it to be
at the start of the folder so it always plays at the

00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,020
start of the folder there and then when we go
ahead and look at this star trophy, where

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,550
it says animation controller in the
inspector animator controller we give it

00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,210
the new one we've created so we can build
it up bit by bit.

00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,740
Drop it in there and now we have an
animation controller, fantastic. So let's

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,170
go into the animator and create
ourselves a new clip which will create

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,790
both a animation clip and a animation
state and then we'll be able to actually start

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,850
sticking things in. So let's have an idle
state first, what does the star trophy do when

00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,520
it's idle? So there's are idle state, how
many samples the second? Well it doesn't

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,760
have to be consistent with everything
else, let's maybe go for 30 samples that second

00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,680
Actually it doesn't matter, this has to do
with the fidelity of your animation. So

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,450
what I want to do is I want to add curve.
Now when you add the curve look

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,150
carefully transform and animator are here
and then top and base are slightly

00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,560
indented, they kind of don't look indented
because they're missing their symbols

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,550
but they are the transform applies to
the star trophy itself; whereas the top,

00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,849
you can independently control the
transform of the top and of the base, so you see

00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:11,810
how that works?

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,080
The star trophy's transform, the top's
transform and the base's reflects the

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,400
layout of the hierarchy. So in our case
it's the top's transform that we want to

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,630
rotate so add that in top transform
rotation. That gives us control over the

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,099
rotation of the top. So if we start off with
just something going at one second let's

00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,550
just try rotating it at one second to...
I don't know, minus 8 point

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,410
77032 how's that for an arbitrary number

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,660
degrees to the left or right, let's see
what happens there. Now you're gonna need to

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,130
focus on your - there you go, look actually
it's to the right so sue me there it

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,170
goes and it just but it just snaps back.
If you look at the animator and then you

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,019
click on your star trophy you see how it's in
the idle state but its snapping back to

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:05,610
the middle but it's working right. So
that's pretty cool,

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,130
another way you could have set that
value is to use the record functionality

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,400
here and then to go off into the scene
and actually make the rotation but we

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,410
can kind of see what's going on now
so if I zoom out, if I say that it's

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,730
rotated minus eight degrees after
this amount of time, after 30

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,170
frames, then what am I going to do to get it back to the
center? Well I'm gonna need to put

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,780
another key frame in which is this
button here, a little diamond and

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,459
I'm going to need to put that in at an
appropriate time, and an appropriate time would be

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,810
60 frames right? Exactly twice as long, I
want a key frame where the rotation is

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:50,260
zero. Try that. Now let's see what happens as it
loops around. There it goes and at least it goes back to

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,950
the middle and then bounces. So here's a
micro challenge for you, I want you to

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,010
add in another two keyframes after this in
time so that it not only wobbles to the

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,340
right and back but it also wobbles to the
left and back to the centre, so we get a

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,850
smooth swaying motion. Go ahead and have
a go at making that smooth swaying motion

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,690
yourself right now.

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,590
So to get that full rotation working
what we need to do is say well if it's

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,690
minus a point seven degrees rotation
around the Z axis at 30 frames well then

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:28,000
let's go to ninety frames there, click a
new keyframe and then put exactly the

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,670
opposite in, so one way of doing that by
the way is to click on the frame that

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,110
you want a copy from, you could go copy
component, and then you can go to the

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,230
target frame and then paste component
values. Of course you'd have to make the

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,560
negative into a positive. So let's try
that; it's nearly there but of course we need

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,650
to return to centre, so when we look at
the sunflower it's nearly gonna be there but

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,720
it's gonna snap and I've accidentally
done something to the base, It's all about that

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,050
bass, 'bout that bass. So... what have I done
now? I've done something with the Star Trophy

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,890
position by mistake. If you do that, get
an extra curve just delete it, simple.

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,970
So let's look at the rotation now just
at the top again. Now what's happening?

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,910
You see, interesting. Now you're seeing
compound animation. You're seeing both

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,720
the whole star trophy and its base being
animated at the same time... and it's top

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,680
being animated at the same time. It's fine,
but it's not what we want right. So again

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,550
we take out the star trophy animation
line; it's a different line to the top

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,919
rotation, that is a completely separate
animation curve. OK so take that one

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:37,650
out and now we're just down to the base
which goes from zero to minus 8.7, to zero, to

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:44,050
plus 8.7 or it would do had
we pasted onto the right thing. Now all

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,270
of those mistakes have very useful so you see
the sort of common things that can

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,500
happen if you apply your curve to the
wrong object. Nearly there, it's just

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,560
snapping at the end of the animation and
I think you know why, congratulations if

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,340
you did manage to do this yourself by
the way so a hundred and twenty frames in

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:06,130
we just need to reset to zero. Let's just
check it works, sometimes with this you

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,470
need to reset to like 359 instead of 0 or
something to stop glitching; or to get the

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,430
direction right but this is fine look, here
we go it rocks. I mean it literally rocks and it rocks

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,790
you get the idea

00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,330
so we have an idle state so the other
state that we may want to produce for

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,370
this would be a little star who starts
in the middle and then expands over time

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,400
and then pops off and goes up to the top
so let me show you that quickly and then

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,490
I'm going to go into fast motion and
animate all my characters because you

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,450
now have, or you will have all the
fundamentals you need so let's go find a

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:46,650
star. Here we go, star dot PNG  there... So I'm gonna
make a new game object here I 'm gonna make a

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,920
new child object for the star trophy and just call it star

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,870
Alright, so there it is then I'm gonna
give that star a sprite renderer and

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,150
attach it or I could have just dragged the star straight to the star trophy and it would have done all of

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,510
that for me. There it is, the challenge is of course
this order, this sort order, this sort

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,780
order business having to constantly set
the sort order - pain in the butt as far as I'm

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,230
concerned, why don't we take our level
canvas and just - if you look at it in 3d

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,160
take the whole level canvas - just move
the guy back a little bit, let's just say

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,680
give you some positive z. So .5 in the Z direction

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,600
OK so just move the level canvas back
away from the camera, so that's setting the

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,230
level canvas's position in Z to
nought point five. Now if we had

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,830
accidentally with our star not bothered
to set the order in layer to one,  left it at zero it'd

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,480
still show, handy tip eh? And it can save you a ton
of time again. As it happens we still do

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,950
need order in layer, in fact we need two, because
we want the star to be on the top this

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,570
time we actually do want it on top of an
existing sprite use the sprite renderer or

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,690
order in layer to order sprite parts on
top of each other.

00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,540
Don't use it to try and get the sprite
itself above the background, because

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,070
that's just a hassle having to do that
every time. We want by default when you

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,650
drop a sprite down on the background for
it just to work, right? It makes sense to

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,700
me and then if you want to if you want
to change the ordering within a sprite

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,370
like we're doing here then you use the
ordering in layers. Anyway, here we go, let's

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,620
move this star trophy up a little bit
and then re-scale and after a few

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,080
iterations we'll get to a point where we've
got what we want - which is a star that

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,270
sits in the middle of the

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,040
trophy and now we can go in and animate
growth and eventual departure of this

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,250
star, so let's take a look at doing that.
We add a curve and and this time we look for

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,170
the star's

00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,800
transform but this time instead of
animating either its position or rotation

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:53,380
we're going to animate its scale; and what is the
scale of the star gonna be when the

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,360
trophy is idle and just rocking left and
right? Well you can set the scale to zero,

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,240
that is one option, let's just do that and
then I'm going to show you another option to

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,240
achieve exactly the same result. So if we
set the scale of the star to 0 at the

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,940
beginning, and let's just set it say to
what it is at the end, watch what happens -

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,790
the star will grow during the idle state. You
see it growing there? It's not moving with it,

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,600
you can tell me why in a minute,

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,170
do you know why? Why is the star just sitting
there well it's because the star is childed

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,130
to the trophy if you

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,870
childed the star to the top itself
look what happens just by dragging in

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,830
the hierarchy, it now takes its
transform relative to the top... and

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,920
there it goes it rocks away with the top.
So let's watch the animation again, yeah it's

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,260
rocking away with to the top but over in
the animator now the star's scale is no

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,580
longer working properly and has actually
gone yellow, and that yellow means that

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,950
it has nothing to animate and that's
because the star

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,750
object itself has been moved in the
hierarchy so the animator has lost track

00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,240
of where it is in the hierarchy. So let me
show you the other way to get the star

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,890
to not be there during the idle phase,
remember at this point we're in the idle state.

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,310
So another way to do this would simply be
to go like this; drill through the top on

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,890
here to the star, and that's why I lost
it as it was moved in the hierarchy, and use

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,780
the IsActive method, and you can just
say here in the animator no it's not

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,410
active at the start and in the idle
state it's also not active at the end. So

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,440
what happens then we look at it is it's
just it's there the star, ready to go

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,150
ready to animate but it's not active, right?
Great so how about if we were to have

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,640
another clip and let's say it's

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:43,070
what do we call it? Star birth or producing
the star or something like that. I'm

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,560
gonna call it star birth, here we go so we have
a star birth state, and then what's

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,690
going to happen in that star birth state?
Well the very first thing is that we go

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:57,800
drill through the top to the star and
make it active. Tick, fine and then once

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,220
it's active we want it to grow over a
period of maybe four seconds, so add

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,430
another curve to the star itself
transform all the way through to its

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,850
scale, now we can control its scale so
at the start we're going to have it's scale 0

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,500
and at the end it's going to be this
point two that we've found ourselves - if

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,100
you're not sure go over, use the record mode,
go into the scene and scale the star whilst

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,840
selected on the key frame you want so
select on this key frame, go to the

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,560
scene and then move it how you want it
and then when you come back you'll find

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,570
it will have set these properties, that's what
this red means, that's what the red here

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,340
means - it means it's in record mode, and that's what
the red play, pause, and step means. OK

00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,290
so star birth,

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,750
that's fine, let's think to ourselves
very briefly under what

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,180
circumstances would the star be born? Well
actually it would be born after a

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,960
certain number of loops of the idle
animation, let's say maybe after 5, so after 5 loops a

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,490
star is born, and then if you right click
again on star birth and say make transition,

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,800
after one cycle of star birth it goes back to
idle. Let's watch this work. Look in the scene

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,640
view, it's going to cycle around idle 5 times
actually it didn't in this case, we'll check

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,880
why in a minute but the star birth bit is
working . So idle... ok and the reason is

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,940
it's a very easy on these transition
arrows to not save the value so really

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,960
aggressively hit the enter key and make
sure that value gets saved, and then a

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,780
single iteration of star birth. OK. so they're
your transitions, you're saying do me

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,490
the idle animation i.e. the rocking for five
cycles and this is where you adjust how

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,680
often a star trophy actually gives out
star by the way, it's actually a

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,830
play tuning in here

00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,760
So it rocks a certain number of times
and then eventually the transition will

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
happen into star birth, at

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,120
which point it stops moving, the star comes
up and we're nearly there we just want the

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,130
start to float up, ok so how far do we
want it to float up? Well go to the

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,360
star birth thing and let's say at four
seconds, so go and select at four seconds let's

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,600
use - which you can do by just clicking on
a key frame - let's use the this record system so

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,570
make sure you're in record, go to the scene,
and then just do what you want to do to

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,950
the star over in the scene it's a core
facility. Just get your star selected, get

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,070
your transform tool selected, and say
well after four seconds I want it about

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,970
this high, so imagine one of these was in
the top row, it would be one whole square

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,280
up which is perfectly reasonable but
also looking at it like this at this

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,670
zoom level I think to myself actually
I want it bigger, so why not just do it right there.

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,290
You can just scale the star however you like here.

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,290
Cool, so what that's done back at the
animator is it's recorded those things

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,900
that you've just done into the animator,
just click Play you'll see. So we just wait

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,130
for the transition to happen, there we go,
watch the star - up it comes it comes up

00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:00,010
and expands and then pops - perfect, how
cool is that? We have a star trophy

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,600
animation that's working really nicely for
us ok now if you are somebody who likes

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,980
to keep everything in one place and you
don't like the fact that the number of

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,900
cycles of idle before the star gets
released is encoded inside the animator

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,660
here then that's fine, if you want to
have it somewhere else like in a script

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,010
you could just have a script set this
value but we're not doing that for now.

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,420
We've got a great result which is that the
star trophy is using bone based animation

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,660
to rock back and forth, to create a star
and the star comes out and floats up to

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,570
the top.

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,580
Fantastic, so you have all the building
blocks you need because not only do you

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,920
have that type of animation but of
course if we click over we have a lizard

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,920
here which is completely different; this
guy is a sprite sheet based animation

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,750
with multiple states, so pretty cool. I'd
like you to firstly create at least one

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,330
bone based animation for yourself.

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,880
OK that's all I want you to do, so at
this stage have already created one

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,769
sprite animation

00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,689
in my case the lizard now I want you to
create one bone animation so add life to

00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:05,809
a still sprite, for example a gravestone
or star trophy; move or rotate its

00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,439
transform slightly over time;

00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:11,800
make the animation loop continuously;
give it at least two animation states as

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,059
we've done there, and then for example that
could be an idle and attacking or

00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:21,249
attacked state. So go ahead and make your
bone animation now, I'm not going to show you

00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:25,939
how because I've just shown you how
with mine. If you want to use exactly the

00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:28,910
same asset as I have and follow me through well
you're welcome to rewind, but I really

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,040
would prefer you stop the video and do your
own animation now with reference to what

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,769
I've just done. Cool, congratulations, good luck
with that and I shall see you in the

00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,790
next video where we'll talk about
movement and childing in a little bit

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,730
more detail before you then go off and
do all of the animation. See you soon.
