00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700


2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.700
So in the last video I left you to finish off the Defenders! So what other

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.700
Defenders do we have to think about? Well let's have a look in our Assets. The

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.700
Cactus. we've already done. The Fox is an Attacker. The Gnome

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.700
is the next Defender. so let's go ahead and make the Gnome! So we Create an Empty

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.700
GameObject. We call it Gnome. G n o m e. [Hums]

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.700
We give it a Animation Controller. an Animator rather.

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.700
which is the same thing. In the Gnome. I'm going to create an

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.700
Animator Controller. I'm going to call it

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.700
Gnome. underscore Gnome. Why underscore

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.700
you say? It floats to the front. Pop it on the Gnome. pop the Gnome in the

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.700
Defenders. and we're starting to see a pattern. I'm going to create an empty child.

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.700
I'm going to call it. guess what. Body. I'm going to go

14
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.700
find myself an idle frame of animation. and stick it

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.700
against the Sprite Renderer of the Body. so same pattern. The Gnome

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.700
has an Animator. it has a sub-object called a Body. it has a Sprite Renderer on it. The Sprite

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Renderer has like a default sprite for positioning. and then. we

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.700
need to go in and do a couple of things with the Gnome. actually. One is I'm going to move

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
him down. I'm going to move him to a whole number. so he's on

20
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.700
grid. That's good! I'm going to go to the Body of the Gnome. So the Gnome is now

21
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.700
at 4. 2. but the Body of the Gnome... It doesn't matter where you put these. by the way. I'm just showing you`

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.700
the principles. The Body of the Gnome is a little bit big to my eye. so I'm going to go to the Scale Tool. and

23
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.700
just put the white bit in the middle. scale him down a little. Now. you're going to ask me how

24
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700
do I turn him around? How do I make him face the other way? Well

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.700
what you do on the Body is. you make the X scale. look red is the X axis.

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.700
make it negative. Boom! And he turns around. and he looks pretty

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.700
good there! OK. so to recap. the Gnome is at 4. 2. precisely.

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.700
It's scale is OK as an Animator. but the Body has a negative

29
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.700
X scale. That's how I've turned him around! Pretty cool hey! OK.

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.700
so what do we need to do next? Well we need to make sure that the Gnome has its Animation Controller.

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.700
It does! Then. we need to start making the clips don't we? So we Add a Curve to the Gnome.

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
What shall I call it? Well I'm going to start prefixing these things with

33
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700
the name of the object. just so that we don't have multiple animation clips in

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.700
our project. all with the same name like Idle. OK. so I'm just going to call it gnome

35
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.700
idle.

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.700
Boom there you go! It's the Body's Sprite Renderer

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.700
that we animate. It comes with a couple of default frames. we don't worry

38
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.700
ourselves about those. We grab the Gnome. we stick his frames in. it's all getting very

39
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.700
routine now. but some things in game development are just like this. So there's

40
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.700
the Gnome. he's got himself an idle state. Let's look at the Animator.

41
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.700
Gnome Idle. That's fine. and let's just see what it looks

42
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.700
like. Gnome Idle. I can't really see him there. so we'll zoom in. There he is. blinking away.

43
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.700
He's absolutely fine! Cool! Let's get the next state. before we worry about

44
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.700
how long we need to be in idle. So we're going to add a new clip.

45
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.700
I'm going to call it gnome

46
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.700
hop. I think when I looked at the frames of animation. it kind of looked like a hop. and

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.700
I named it hop here. Yeah. so gnome hop! We Add the Curve to the

48
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.700
Body. Remember the sub-objects. Sprite Renderer. Sprite. same old same old

49
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.700
I'm afraid. And let's go grab all these

50
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.700
hop frames. Yep. pop them in. Boom!

51
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.700
Delete whatever came there in the beginning. move all the rest to the left.

52
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.700
and there's hopping. OK. wonderful! So

53
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.700
this is at 60 frames a second. whereas the idle I think

54
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.700
was at 30. so I'll set them both to 60 before I worry about the timings.

55
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.700
OK. move the animation

56
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.700
all the way to the left. in both cases. Call idle and

57
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.700
hop. Alright. so now let's try and get the transition times going. So how long does

58
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.700
Idle last? Firstly. let's have a look in here.

59
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.700
Well let's just watch it.

60
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.700
Not very long at all. it's only lasting for 6 frames

61
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.700
and it's 30 frames a second. so it goes around that 5 times a

62
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.700
second. So when we make our transition. if we want 3 seconds then we'd

63
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.700
better go 5 times 3. which is up to 15. Let's just make sure that looks about right.

64
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.700
1.000. 2.000. 3.000.

65
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.700
and then into hopping. So let's look at this hopping animation a little bit more

66
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.700
closely. Idle is fine. he's just blinking his eyes. Hopping is going a little bit weird.

67
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.700
Look he just kind of does a tiny bit of a hop and then he stops for ages.

68
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.700
So let's go have a look at the hop animation.

69
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.700
So go to the Gnome. go to the hop. zoom out... Ah! I've got

70
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.700
an extra keyframe on the end! That was the two default keyframes it made! That one

71
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.700
on the end means he's waiting. before he does anything else. Let's try now!

72
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.700
So he's idle. idle. idle. Let's zoom in and then he hops

73
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.700
a little bit. And is it enough times? Well he's going to stay in

74
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.700
hop isn't he. because there's absolutely no reason for him to go back. So we make the transition

75
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.700
to go back. and then. we think how long? Well gnome hop.

76
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.700
how long does that last? It looks like it's lasting 11

77
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.700
frames. at 30 frames a second. So let's round terms

78
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.700
1/3 of a second. So if we want 3 seconds. then we're going to need to do about

79
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.700
9 cycles. So 9 on the exit time. let's see what happens!

80
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.700
It's about 3 seconds in the idle.

81
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.700
and he's not doing much in there. so maybe it didn't

82
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.700
save. Yeah. I have to try again. You must be not in play mode but in

83
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.700
9. Return. check your preview graph. make sure it actually gets the change.

84
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.700
and then. try again. Let's have a look at this guy a bit more

85
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.700
closely. He's blinking away and he's hopping away! Great! And he

86
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.700
should go over to blinking in a second. There you go! Awesome! So we now have

87
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.700
all of the Defenders that we want. right. Let's just check the Assets.

88
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.700
Oh no. we have a Gravestone! Final Defender. so let's take a look at the Gravestone!

89
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.700
OK. so let's do this fairly sharp time. because this is something

90
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.700
you've seen before. Grave Stone. two words. I'm going to put it

91
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.700
on grid at say 3. 2. or something. for now.

92
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.700
Let's give him an Animator. Done!

93
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.700
Let's make him an Animator. I'm doing this manually

94
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.700
each time. just to show you. or Animator Controller rather. show you

95
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.700
what it entails so that you understand it from the basics right.

96
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.700
_Grave Stone Animator

97
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.700
Controller. There you go! Now the Grave Stone Animator Controller needs to go on

98
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.700
there. Then. we need to make a Body sub-object again. create

99
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.700
an empty child. call it body. Give that a Sprite Renderer.

100
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.700
Yes. there are lots of shortcuts to this. but we just want to understand. really

101
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.700
burning. exactly how this works right. how all of these components relate.

102
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.700
It's just a single frame. so let's give it a single frame. Let's go look in the scene.

103
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.700
Where is it? It's there! Firstly. it's too big so scale it down. Now.

104
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.700
it's in I would say a slightly strange position. so using the W key I'm going to move it

105
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.700
up and across to roughly 1.2. And then. I'm going to set

106
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.700
it in the Inspector to precisely 1. 2. Then. I'm gong to go and take a

107
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.700
look and see how it seems to fit. That looks about OK to me. actually.

108
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.700
So he's sitting there. let's do the checks. It's got an Animator. it's got a Body.

109
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.700
the main item is perfectly on grid at 3.

110
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.700
2. The parent. that's really important. That's all awesome.

111
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.700
OK. so there you go! Now. this guy is going to need some animation.

112
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.700
He's going to need to do something like wobble or shake.

113
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.700
when he gets attacked. and the rest of the time. perhaps he should just sit

114
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.700
still doing nothing. So we're going to have Grave Stone Attacked and Grave Stone

115
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.700
Idle. Let's get to work on that. Also. Grave Stone. of course. needs to be in the Defenders. So

116
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.700
Defenders. good to go. Grave Stone. OK animation!

117
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.700
Add. well a Curve will do actually! Let's call it

118
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.700
gravestone idle.

119
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.700
That is going to do absolutely nothing. it's just going to

120
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.700
sit there alright. So it's just going to be a state against the Grave

121
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.700
Stone. called gravestone idle. OK.

122
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.700
so let's make the other curve. Now we're going to.

123
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.700
We're going to look at the Body. but instead of messing around with the sprite. we're going to

124
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.700
go to the transform position. OK. and what I'm going to do

125
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.700
is. about eery 1/2 a second I'm just going to move it. so I

126
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.700
don't know. something like this. Take a small fraction of a second. set yourself a

127
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.700
key frame. So we're in the Body position of the Grave Stone.

128
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.700
When you're in this red record mode. if you're not you hit the red button under

129
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.700
Scene. then go across and just move the Grave Stone a little.

130
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.700
OK. now try playing. You've just. Ah. there you go. you see what's happening?

131
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.700
This guy is just shaking back and forth. If we look at the animation. it's just because

132
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.700
it's passing from this position on the left. the position is 1. 2.

133
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.700
to a position of 1.06. 2. But using the record mode allowed

134
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.700
me to actually go into the scene and record that. So that works really well. look it's

135
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.700
just shaking away. OK. so that's fine. but of course.

136
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.700
what I've done here is I have set that against the idle. which

137
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.700
I shouldn't have done. So I could just rename the idle clip.

138
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.700
If you do something like that. you can just say GraveStone. what do we call it. attacked.

139
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.700
Yeah. it's being attacked. And then. I can make myself

140
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.700
another clip called. well

141
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.700
[Create New Clip]. gravestone idle.

142
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.700
And that is the one that is going to do nothing. and it's going to be the default state. So

143
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.700
which one's which? Gravestone idle 0. gravestone attacked? Let's have a look!

144
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.700
So if you click in the Animator tab. you see if I say click on gravestone

145
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.700
idle I can look here and it says gravestone attack. So that's the one I need to

146
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.700
change the name. Oops. attacked. And then. this guy

147
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.700
gravestone idle 0 should actually just be called gravestone idle. they should be swapped around.

148
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.700
I think it makes sense to go from left to right. So once these two are in

149
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.700
the right way. we can change the default. The default's currently on the right. so we right click and

150
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.700
say Set As Default. The orange moves to idle. Let's see how long it stays in idle.

151
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.700
OK a second or two. So now we can just

152
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.700
change the Exit Time. in this case. by just putting in the number of seconds. 3 seconds. Let's

153
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.700
check it in the preview. Yep. it looks right! because we have

154
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.700
no animation points. this Exit Time actually becomes a time in seconds; the

155
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.700
rest of the time. it's a number of cycles. So let's check that it stays in idle for 3

156
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.700
seconds. and then. it starts to go to attacked. So that's awesome!

157
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.700
So let's make our return state. Now. how long should

158
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.700
the return state take? So our thing here is

159
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.700
happening between 10 frames. There are 60 frames in a second. so it's a

160
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.700
1/6 of a second. If I want 3 seconds. we need 6. 12. 18.

161
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.700
18 cycles on here. You're welcome to change all these and mess around with them all

162
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.700
you like. I'm just trying to get a rough idea of how many cycles we need. in order to get back. So he

163
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.700
sits idle for 3 seconds. and then. he attacks for 18 cycles.

164
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.700
which is about 3 seconds. then he goes back. Awesome! All of our defenders are

165
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.700
now behaving themselves and switching between their states.

166
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.700
Is that right? Yep. the Cactus is right. but actually. let's just

167
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.700
make a quick change to the Cactus. He's facing the wrong way. and he's a bit big isn't he?

168
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.700
So I'm gong to go to the Cactus. to the Body sub-element.

169
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.700
I'm going to scale him down a little. bring him inside. There you go. that's

170
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.700
a little bit better! And then. the other thing I'm going to do on the Cactus is to switch him

171
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.700
around. Now. that's a micro challenge for you. Before the end of this video. if any of your Defenders

172
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.700
are facing the wrong way. I want you to remember. from what I said earlier. how to switch their position.

173
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.700
So go ahead. switch the position of the Cactus around now. and I'll be back in a second!

174
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.700
Welcome welcome! So remember it was putting a minus on

175
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.700
the X. Awesome! So now they really do. all of these Defenders. look

176
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.700
like they are cycling through their different states properly.

177
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.700
and we're setting up a nice little showcase. Why not take a screenshot of this and paste it into

178
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.700
the discussions and share it with your other students now. and I'll see you in a minute!

179
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.033
