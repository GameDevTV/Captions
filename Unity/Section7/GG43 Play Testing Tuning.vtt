1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So everyone, we're on the finishing straight!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One of the things I think we need, before we can play

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
tune, is to give the player some indication of how much it's

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
going to cost them, in terms of stars, to place one of these

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
defenders. Right now, I have no affordance about that. I just don't know

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
what they're going to cost. So in this video, we

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
are going to firstly, display the defender cost

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
on the buttons. Then, I'm going to ask you to

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
tweak the spawn frequency of the attackers. Adjust

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the health of the attackers and defenders. Choose the

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
amount of damage that the projectiles do, and just generally play

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the game and make sure it's a fun challenging game to play.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, let's start off by sorting out this lack of

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
affordance, about the cast of these items.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
How are we going to do that? Well firstly, we need to think how we're going to structure it.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We have already got buttons here, and if we look

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in 3D, we can see where they

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are in the game space. Let's just get around to this side.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is the ideal place to put the text, right

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
on top of these buttons here. Right next

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to the silhouette. So, how are we going to do that? Which

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
canvas are we going to use? Is it this Top Level, Level Canvas?

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Or shall we add a canvas to buttons?

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If you look down at say the cactus and the gnome,

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
etc., you'll notice that they

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
already have nearly everything we need. They have a Button Script,

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
they're in the right places.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So, I think what makes some sense is just to add a component

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to Buttons called Canvas.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now the buttons themselves actually have canvases on them.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Let's try now, adding a

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
UI Text Element,

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and childing it to say the Cactus. Let's

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
take the Cactus as a test case. I'm going to call that

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
element Cost. So, what I'v'e done is, I've put a Canvas

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
on the Buttons element itself, and then, against

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the Cactus Button, as a child, I've put a Cost.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'll put xx for the moment, to say that I don't actually have a

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
cost. Now look, it's huge! Look in the world

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
space here. It's absolutely massive! Firstly, check that your Canvas here is

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
World Space. it is World Space! That's good!

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then, we need to scale this text. We only need to

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
do it once, because once we've done it once we can

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
reuse it for the other buttons. So, let's put the other

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
text in the center or at the bottom,

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
vertically. Choose

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
a color. I'm going to go for yellow. I think that'll work!

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You need a font size, such that the

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
text is not to aliased.

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In your UI Tool here, we need to scale this guy,

51
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
so it's roughly the right shape.

52
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, that's the right sort of shape. Now, you need to

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
change the scale of this, altogether, so let's try 0.1

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
by 0.1 and see where that takes us.

55
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It takes us there. I'm going to go back to 2D.

56
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So, all you need to do is move this Cost Element,

57
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
over the top of your actual

58
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
buttons. OK, so that's your mission now. So we grab it and move it

59
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And then, you could say well, why don't

60
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
we calculate the position? Well, it's a little bit harder to calculate, because we're

61
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
dealing some of the time with world space and some of the time with pixel

62
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
space. So, it's a

63
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
little bit easier to just move it around, the way that I'm doing

64
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
it. OK, remember you can't just size it down, because you'll

65
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
run out of font size. Alright, so you need

66
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to get the element

67
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
stroke font size combination, so that you get a nice clearly

68
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
rendered font, and then, you just need to scale

69
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
using the Rect Transform

70
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Scale, to make the final size changes. You can make minor

71
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
tweaks, by changing the size of the

72
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
actual canvas, once it's been scaled, the width and the height in pixels.

73
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but your major change needs to be done by scaling, because of the

74
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
way we've got everything else set up. So, I'm going to put that at the

75
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
bottom left. Something like that!

76
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Oops, careful not to move the wrong object!

77
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And then, that's what we need! We have a little

78
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
label. You see if I go here, it's quite clear what's going on.

79
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Also, we need to decide, do we want this label to be behind or in front?

80
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Well, I think it would make sense for it to be in front. So, the Cactus

81
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
itself needs an order in

82
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
layer of 0, but if you do that

83
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
see what happens when you go to 0? You see it kind of goes

84
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
transparent, because it's kind of confluenced with this background.

85
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
That's the problem

86
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you're going to have, if you go to 0. So, how are we going to

87
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
make the Cactus show up properly and have

88
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
this text in front?

89
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
That's a good question for you. You could try changing the Z position, but that's

90
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
only going to influence it's position relative to

91
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the sprite. It's not actually going to help it coming in front of the

92
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
sprite, it's only going to help it change compared to the

93
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
background,

94
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and that's because some of these things are transforms, if you

95
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
look at the top of the Inspector. And some of these things are rect transforms.

96
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So, how do we get this text in front? Or do we

97
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
bother getting this text in front? Do we just leave it de-conflicted

98
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
out of the way there, and never go over the top? Well, that's a

99
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
design decision for you. It depends on what you think looks best.

100
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
If you want to have it sit in front or do some funny

101
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
fade or make it look really pretty, then you just need to

102
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
play with your Z positions, your ordering, and to look in

103
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
3D, to work out exactly what you want laying

104
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
in front of what. But for simplicity, I'm just going to duplicate this

105
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Cost, into each of the other items for now

106
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and not worry about that position in Z.

107
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I'm going to use the Transform

108
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Moving Tool,

109
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
to make sure that these are lined up against their relevant

110
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
buttons.

111
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
OK, so now for each of your buttons

112
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
you have a subelement, that has a text

113
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
script on it. XX, because by default we want

114
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
it to read nothing, because

115
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
we haven't read yet the cost of the Defender Prefab. We do

116
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
want the change in the Defender Prefab

117
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Cost to be reflected

118
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
from this script, Cost here, into this button.

119
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So, on load we're going to have to do something over

120
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
here, that's going to help take the defender cost from the defender item

121
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and put it on that text. How are we going to do that? Well, we've got

122
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
got some code to do that. We've already got Button

123
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Script, so we do not need to create anymore classes or

124
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
create anymore scripts. So, go into your Button Script,

125
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and let's think about how we're going to do it.

126
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So, it's all going to happen on Start. We may well refactor this out

127
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in a moment, but for now, we need

128
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
access to something called a Cost Text.

129
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So, what type of element is a Cost Text? It's going to be a

130
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
text, so private Text Cost,

131
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
not Texture. Text cost

132
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Text; Now, why is Text in red?

133
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Because I need the UnityEngineUI namespace, for the first time in

134
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
the button right. The button didn't do anything to do with UI, it does

135
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
now. There's a world space before.

136
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Fantastic! So, on Start we're going to need to say that costText

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
= what?

138
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Well, it's going to be... Actually, I'm going to get

139
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
you to do it. It's one of these things that's on the

140
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
screen, and I'm going to leave it as a challenge for you,

141
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
to get the rest of that working. So, here's your challenge!

142
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Read the starCost, from the relevant defender. Display the

143
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
cost on the button, in the small text field that we just created,

144
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and log a warning, if you can't find that text.

145
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Laughs] Ah, just when you thought you were going to sit back

146
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and relax and copy and paste. You'll never learn anything that way.

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Fantastic! So, that's your challenge. Good

148
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
luck, and I'll see you soon!

149
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
OK, welcome back! So,

150
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the method I'm going to use it GetComponentInChildren.

151
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Let's make sure we know why it's

152
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
GetComponentInChildren.

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Because if we look over in Unity,

154
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
here the Cactus has the Button Script on it, and Cost

155
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
is a child of that, so that's why it's GetComponentInChildren.

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And then, this child GameObject

157
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
has a type against it, of Text, because we have a Text component

158
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
on it. Alright, so if we GetComponent

159
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
InChildren. I'm going to use this format, the

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
generic format, &lt;Text&gt; like that in the

161
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
chevrons. Then, we have our costText

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
set. Fantastic! A couple more lines. We need to say if there's

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
no costText, then we need to give the designer some indication

164
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
of what they need to be doing about it. We Debug.Log what,

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
warning or error? Well, it's not going to stop the game running, so I'm just going to

166
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
log a warning, and we're going to say which object

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
has the problem, with a space " has no

168
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
cost text". So, it just warns

169
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
the designer that there's not cost text been assigned

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
against it. What do I mean by no costText? I mean

171
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
that this sub-object is missing this Text Script.

172
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
OK, that's what would happen if there was a Text Script missing. I'm going to do it all

173
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
on one line. You just have to be really careful,

174
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
particularly with your semicolon here, that you include a semicolon.

175
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
This one line, of course, is equivalent to the format we

176
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
usually show you, which is that. So, if you

177
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
want to get it on one line

178
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
without having to... Sorry I've got a, one second.

179
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I have got myself an

180
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
error. That's because I have never closed the brackets on Start,

181
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
so let's just compile, prove it compiles. Great! If you

182
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
ever want to compact a line down, if it's a single line in an

183
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
if, then probably write it this way, the way we've always shown you

184
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
to and then delete back. If you really do want

185
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
to keep it compact. It's just another option for you, OK.

186
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So, it's costText.text is the text

187
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
part of the costText element =, now one

188
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
long line for us, just for practice. You

189
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
see these sort of long lines on the Internet, so why not get used to it.

190
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
defenderPrefab.GetConponent. We need to get from the Defender

191
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Prefab, it's &lt;Defender&gt;() component,

192
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
to method.starCost. And we're nearly

193
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
there but it's an int, so we need to go ToString();

194
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
costText.text = defenderPrefab.GetComponent

195
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
&lt;Defender&gt;().starCost.ToString();

196
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Mumbling as I go! So,

197
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
let's try it! Let's just remind ourselves, before we go in, what we're expecting.

198
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We're expecting to see 10 for the Cactus...

199
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
10 for the Cactus. I'm going to set the

200
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Gnome to 20. I want them to be different right. Set the

201
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
prefabs' defender cost different to each other,

202
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
so that you can see that this is working. It also may help

203
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
or hinder your game tuning. So let's try it!

204
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Perfect! 10, 20, 30,

205
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
40. So now, we have some affordance as to what it's going to cost. That guy

206
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
is going to cost me 40. Shooting this fox

207
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
is just going to cost me 20. I've got 20 left, so I can't

208
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
afford to put one of these down. You see, great! Much easier

209
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to play now! Fantastic! So, how are we doing on the

210
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
lecture? We

211
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
have displayed the defender cost. Now, I want you to tweak

212
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
the spawn frequency of the attackers, adjust the health, etc. So, that's

213
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
your challenge, is basically play tune the game engine.

214
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There's several things you can change, healths,

215
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
projectile damage, etc.

216
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Have a go! Make sure the game is challenging,

217
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is fun, and is how you want it! And I suggest that

218
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
once you've done it for the first level, you

219
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
make each level a little bit harder, than the

220
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
previous level, and preferably introduce a new game mechanic. Now, I'm

221
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
not going to go through all of this, because it's very time consuming, but I

222
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
would suggest that on Level 1 you don't even have the

223
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
stones, in my game for example, that you maybe just

224
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
have one type of defender and one type of attacker.

225
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And then, maybe in Level 2 you introduce another attacker or another defender,

226
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and then, in Level 3 you introduce yet another.

227
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
OK, so creating new levels will be relatively easy,

228
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
if everything is prefabbed up properly.

229
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So, at this stage in the course, I think you're ready to do that. So, play tune your game,

230
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
make two or three levels, and when you've finished,

231
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
share it! Share it on Game Bucket! Share it with everybody else on the

232
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
course! I want to see what you've created! Brice really wants to

233
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
see what you've created, so we can't wait to see what comes out the other

234
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
end of Glitch Garden. Go ahead, finish off your game,

235
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
play tune it, and we'll talk about mobile deployment soon!

236
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
OK, so what I am going to show you quickly is a way of

237
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
creating a second and third level. So, I could delete the second

238
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and third levels, just remove them altogether,

239
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and then

240
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Duplicate, firstly, just Level 1

241
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
into Level 2 and then I'm going to Duplicate

242
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
again. Let's assume that this state we've created is actually

243
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Level 3 and that

244
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
we want Level 1 and 2 to be simpler.

245
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So, what are we going to lose for Level 2? So, let's go to Level 2

246
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and think, well how do we roll this out,

247
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
if it's going to be three levels? So, maybe in Level 1 you only have one

248
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
defender and one attacker. So, in Level 1

249
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
you'd probably have a sun and

250
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
maybe just a cactus dude. So, what

251
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
you can do in Level 1 is, you can go ahead to your buttons, and then, start

252
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
deleting the Stone

253
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and the Gnome,

254
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and then, just squeeze down the Background...

255
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
...like so. Move it.

256
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
You get the idea right? And then, move the Trophy

257
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
to X = 2. Let's see

258
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
how well that runs!

259
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Now, it's going to be tricky, because we're going to have multiple

260
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
attacker types. So, I think it's probably worth

261
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
getting rid of the Fox, here as well. So, how do get rid of the Fox? You go to your

262
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Spawners, all of your Spawners. You set their

263
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Array Size to 1 and have just a Lizard now.

264
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
OK,

265
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
so now this Level 1 thing only has

266
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
cactuses and lizards.

267
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Fine! So then, Level 2

268
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
you could say, well what are we going to leave out of Level 2?

269
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Well, maybe we'll leave out the...

270
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Maybe we'll leave out the Gnome or something like that.

271
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So, you get the idea right. You delete the Gnome.

272
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
It'll lose the

273
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
prefab connection. That's fine, we don't care.

274
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Make the background smaller, resize

275
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
the background, or reposition the background.

276
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Move the Stone and the Trophy one

277
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
left. OK,

278
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
you get the idea! So now, we're rolling out functionality,

279
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
as we roll through the levels. So,

280
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
in Level 2 we now have

281
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
a gravestone, and we realize that the foxes can jump

282
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
over it. Maybe it's

283
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
a bit much having the foxes in here still, so we'll probably

284
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
just go into the Spawners and take the Foxes out.

285
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I'm just absolutely guessing here. It's a lot of work and time to

286
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
go through and get this, so that it's

287
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
exactly how you want it. So, that's what you're going to need to take

288
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
time to do to take pride in your game. So, Level

289
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
1 has just star trophies and

290
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
cactuses. Level 2 introduces the

291
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
stone here, and then, Level 3 has everything,

292
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
including the foxes,

293
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
so it's all there. So you go oh, foxes jump over

294
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
but I've got another gnome, and you get the idea. So now, we're rolling

295
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
out the

296
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
scope of the game, in terms of the functionality, as we go through the

297
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
levels. You can also go and play tune each of these levels, so they get more

298
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
challenging, as the player gets batter. You just

299
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
need to get other people, not you, to play the game again and again,

300
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and watch what they're doing and see that it

301
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
leads to a challenging fun game. And if it doesn't,

302
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
tweak it and repeat, until it works how you want it to work.

303
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Alright, but that's basically it! If we go from the Start

304
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
of the game now and remind ourselves of what we've done.

305
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We have a nice

306
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
sound on the start. We have options. We have a fade.

307
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
We can play the game. We start on a simple level,

308
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
100 seconds per level. Don't confuse

309
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
that with your 100 stars, initially in the

310
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
bank. We can place producers, we've got animations,

311
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
we've got different types of enemies, and you see how easy it

312
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
was to make multiple levels. All the reward comes in the

313
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
last few minutes, because we've set everything up, so it's that

314
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
easy to just duplicate our levels and create

315
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
new ones. So congratulations on getting

316
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
your game this far! Please do now, go over to

317
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
a gamebuck.io. I'm going to show you and remind you where that is.

318
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And upload your game. So, remember what you need to do,

319
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
you need to build your game for the web in Unity.

320
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
So, that is literally File, Build Settings,

321
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and then, in those settings check that your levels are in the right

322
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
order and they're all in and build it for the web. Pick a resolution

323
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that works for you. I would suggest something...

324
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Well, just pick a resolution and try it, basically.

325
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I wouldn't go a lot more than 1,000 pixels wide,

326
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
maybe 1,200. Just be sympathetic of peoples' monitor sizes.

327
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
When you've done your web build, of course, you need to then

328
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
zip it up. The Build Folder is what we

329
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
want, the web Build Folder. We do not want your entire Project Folder.

330
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
If your music is too big, you want to try and keep this thing under 20 megabytes. You

331
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
may need to re-encode your music, using something like

332
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Audacity or any other music

333
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
thing. Down sample your music a little bit, and then, just upload to

334
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Game Bucket and use it the normal way. So, we can't wait to see your

335
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
game. Please do share it, at this stage, and then,

336
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
next up in this section and the final bit of the course is just

337
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
talking to you about how to deploy to mobile.

338
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.500
So, see you soon!
