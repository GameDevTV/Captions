00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Hey guys, so we're going to be building this
app, this game Glitch Garden, mobile first

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:90%
it's going to primarily be for the mobile,
we're not going to use the keyboard, just

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:84%
tap and drag.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.609 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to look at mobile aspect ratios
and we'll go from there. It will also work

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:84%
on the web, of course, by the way.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:90%
OK cool so what aspect ratios are mobile phones,
what is an aspect ratio it's, it's the width

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.489 align:middle line:90%
divided by the height of the screen. So here's
a list of common aspect ratios so the iPads

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.469 align:middle line:90%
tend to be 4:3 or in decimal four divided
by three is one point three and then you can

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:90%
see up the list that the iPhones as they got
newer went from 4:3 to 3:2 and the latest

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:90%
ones are 16:9 and so are the latest Android
devices.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:90%
So let's target this game at 16:9 at the very
widest and then let's also make sure that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:90%
it gracefully behaves at these lower resolutions.
So, what does that mean?How do we handle lower

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.789 align:middle line:90%
resolutions?Well, you could just stretch everything
- it's really easy but very, very ugly. We

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:13.299 align:middle line:90%
don't want to do that. We could have black
bars it's OK, you could put black bars along

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:90%
the top and bottom if it's say an iPad and
it's quite square and you could have black

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:90%
bars on the side maybe if it's really long
and thin like the iPhone 6 or 5. it's OKbut

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.759 align:middle line:90%
only in extreme cases. We want to try and
do the third option which is to crop the edges,

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.090 align:middle line:84%
being careful about what's lost.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by being careful about what's
lost? Well in printing there's something called

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.479 align:middle line:90%
quiet zones, that's what I'm going to call
it, quiet zones. If this is my background

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:90%
image on my Splash Screen then the bits I've
highlighted in blue are quiet zones, they're

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:90%
places where if we lost them it wouldn't really
matter - there's no text, there are no logos

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing particularly meaningful
- no offence to the artist who drew this - in

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.979 align:middle line:90%
those areas. So that's what I mean by quiet
zones. So this is a 16:9 image, its the widest

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:90%
on the list, and you can imagine that we could
squeeze in to a certain extent about what

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:90%
I've shown without changing the meaning or
the feel of the picture at all so that's what

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.940 align:middle line:90%
So let's dive into Unity and take a look at
that.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:90%
So here we are and we have on our splash screen
this image and I said don't worry too much

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:90%
about the scaling. Now we're going to think
about the scaling much more carefully so choose

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:90%
your UI tool at th top left here or hit the
'T' Key on the keyboard.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Right, so,firstly it's good that your rect
transform has a scale of one in fact if you're

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:90%
not sure just reset it. If that messes things
up like it just has with mine then that's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're going to need to set native size
and you're going to be pretty much back to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
where you were.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Alright so that's set native size on the image
there. So a simple image with preserved aspect,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
native size is where we're starting. This
is in terms of the image so it's a 1600 by

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:90%
900 pixel unscaled transform for the image
sitting there.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Perfect so now let's look at the canvas in
the heirarchy. There it is, now what's that

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:90%
doing? Well it's chopping the top and bottom
of the image off at the moment. Well there's

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:90%
lots of different options here for the UI
scale mode, constant pixel size, scale with

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
screen size or constant physical size.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Well we're going to want to scale with screen
size so that as the screen size of our game

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:90%
changes let's simulate this - pull out your
game window and try just moving it around

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.739 align:middle line:90%
and see what it does; and the behaviours we
get. Let's just continue to look at the outline

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:90%
of what these options do so canvas - remember
you can hit your little blue book there next

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to canvas scaler script and it will open the
Unity docs for you and tell you all about

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.739 align:middle line:90%
the canvas scaler so you can read that in
your own time or if you're having trouble

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:84%
getting to sleep.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.269 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to set my reference resolution
to the same as the image, 1600 by 900 that

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:90%
was right; and then it's a question of what
match mode - do we match width and height

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:90%
or do we go for shrink? So let's start taking
a look at the consequences of setting these

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:90%
different screen match modes, I'm just going
to squeeze in my heirarchy on the left, I'm

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:90%
going to detach my game window all together
and I'm going to make actually I'm going to

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:90%
detach my scene window altogether let's just
make a real mess of Unity; make my scene pretty

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
small and then my game like this. OK now we
can kind of see everything that's going on.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Alright, so, let's try first the match width
or height option. You're welcome to just play

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.050 align:middle line:90%
with this stuff yourself. Start with match
turned over to the width setting so you can

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:90%
go between width and height. So if we have
it matched on width what's happening is that

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.229 align:middle line:90%
as the screen aspect ratio changes it is going
to match the width but you see that it's cropping

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:90%
the top and bottom off, you can see that both
in the preview and here so that's not ideal.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:90%
So if we were to go through our resolutions
like 4 by 3 we don't really want these blue

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:90%
areas at the top and bottom here, these would
be nothing rendered. So the black area means

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:90%
that my current screen size is different - my
current game size is different from this 4:3

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:90%
that I've constrained and doesn't actually
change anything as long as I move it carefully,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:90%
and the blue is saying well your device is
4:3 so this entire blue box including the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.889 align:middle line:90%
background is 4:3, so the device would have
to render something like black, its actually

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.259 align:middle line:90%
showing blue because of the camera background.
It's very helpful at the moment that the camera

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.229 align:middle line:90%
background colour is different to this kind
of grey because it shows the difference.

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's not really what we want, as we work
up through the resolutions, 16:10, all the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:90%
aspect ratios, that's not how we want it to
scale because we don't wand these bars at

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
the top and bottom.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:90%
If we were to scale match on height it would
be just as bad really, let's just take a look.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:90%
It's going to do something similar but now
we're going to have the same problem at the

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:90%
other end, so if we go to 4:3 here it's OK,
as we go up through the aspect ratios we start

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to get bars again so that's not right either.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:90%
So back to the canvas, try shrink to put you
out of your misery. If we shrink let's see

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.169 align:middle line:90%
what happens now so go to 4:3; 4:3 looks OK
because it's chopping the sides off, you see

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:90%
in the preview on the left here? Then as we
go up through the resolutions chopping less

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:90%
and less of the sides off until we get to
16:9 that's the behaviour that we want. Don't

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.710 align:middle line:90%
worry about the black bars, as I said that's
just because of how I've got my game windows

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:90%
set. If we set this window to an actual 16:9
then you can see how it gracefully degrades

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.740 align:middle line:90%
as we go down to the lower aspect ratios and
that's really nice, you get what we're doing

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.949 align:middle line:90%
there and it's going to look like this on
an iPad and like this on an iPhone 6.

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:90%
OK what else do we have to look at on the
canvas? Nothing really, that's kind of it.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.569 align:middle line:90%
So congratulations on that bit, what I want
to do is get my layout back to default because

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:90%
this is looking horrible now... why does it
look weird like this? It's because I'm in

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.449 align:middle line:90%
a 3D project I accidentally set my project
to be 3D. I could click 2D and then double

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:90%
click canvas, and then we'd be back to normal
but I actually want to change my project from

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:90%
3D to 2D so... edit, project settings, editor,
and then go down to default behaviour mode

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:90%
2D. Perfect. So now if I mess up my windows
like this and go back to default it defaults

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:90%
to 2D, I just have to frame my canvas. Alright,
awesome, so look it's time for a challenge

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:90%
for you. We have sorted out the splash screen,
what I want you to do as a challenge is to

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:90%
sort out the start screen now this includes
some text elements that I want to float sensibly

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:90%
in the screen using the same paradigm as before,
the text basically wants to behave as if its

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:90%
stuck to the image so treat the text, I want
the text to stay in the same relative space

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.759 align:middle line:90%
in the image and I want all the text to be
on the outside of the quiet zones I want no

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
text in those quiet zones.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:90%
So get your start menu looking right now,
have a look at the manuals and I shall show

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:90%
you how I do it and talk you through in a
moment.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Cool, welcome back, so pop over to your start
scene let's start setting this guy up. So

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:90%
start with the image. Let's have a look now
we've got a source image here, my little component

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:28.729 align:middle line:90%
is saying it's 1024 by 756 but don't trust
that if you were to go over to images and

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:90%
right - click and reveal and have a look in
your image editor in my case I'm just going

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
to use preview you'll remember that this thing
is 1920 x 1080 well actually I want to adjust

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:90%
the size of that straight away, so I'm going
for pixels 1600 x 900, scaling proportionally,

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:90%
that's fine so re-save your image as 1600
x 900 so that it's the same as the other one

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:90%
in fact I'm going to rename my image so that
it hasn't got a name that's incorrect, great.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Alright so just make sure you're using a 1600
x 900 image on there. Great now set native

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:90%
size and the image will jump up to the size,
to its 1600 x 900. As long as its a simple

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:90%
image with that preserved aspect at native
size then we're done with the image. Up to

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:90%
the canvas. Your settings may be a little
different, don't worry. This is what we need.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Screen space overlay because we're overlaying
over the entire screen and that's all we need

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.760 align:middle line:90%
there let's close that guy down. We want the
scale with screen size option as before. Ah

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:90%
that's looking better, kind of snapping into
place. Reference resolution 1600 by 900, very

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:90%
nice, screen mode shrink now if we do that
we should be almost in business, let's have

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:90%
a look, this is the game window as it gets
thinner, and taller and wider, its pretty

00:09:54.410 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
much working lets just flip through some of
these aspects, these bars suggesting that

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:90%
my window isn't set to 4:3 now we're losing
left and right here, this is what I mean about

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:90%
quiet zones, have a look at your image. This
image does not have quiet zones on the left

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:90%
and right because the glitch is inside the
blue bars and the fox is an important character.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:90%
So this screen let's treat it differently,
this screen, I don't want the sides to be

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.019 align:middle line:90%
chopped off here, OK that's not how I want
it to work. Don't worry about the text by

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:90%
the way for now let's just get the background
working. So this is not the scaling mode that

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:90%
we want in this case, so let's try the expand
option let's see what that gives us if we

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:90%
go to 4:3 what's happening? So remember the
grey is where the platform would be filling

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:90%
in with black. Well, that would have to be
what we do, the iPad would look like that.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Then we move up to the next resolution or
aspect ratio and when we finally get to 16:9

00:10:52.810 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:90%
it would look like that. Again down to the
iPad, black bars top and bottom. I think that

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:90%
if we're going to have this glitch logo showing
like this which I'm perfectly happy with,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:90%
and our image working properly we're going
to have to use that mode so use the expand

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:90%
mode here and it will work fine OK so that's
the difference between expand and shrink now

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.779 align:middle line:90%
let's deal with the text OK I want the text
to stay in the same place on this guy regardless

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:90%
of how my screen sizing is so lets get the
parameters of this text sorted first. What

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean by that, don't worry about the pivot,
but just kind of lay the text out so I wouldn't

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:90%
want any text encroaching on this tree so
that's the kind of size that I've got to work

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:90%
with with the title text, something like that.
Now I'm just going to drag the font size up.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Glitch Garden. That looks pretty good. Yeah?
Glitch Garden. Fine, stop them pesky animals

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:90%
well, OK they could be on a small screen so
let's align it on the left, think about the

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:90%
maximum before you even expand it and now
expand your font up. Looks quite nice, its

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:90%
kind of tapering with the tree right? We're
going to have an options button shortly as

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.839 align:middle line:90%
well, but until we have an options button
let me just get the start and the quit buttons

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:90%
working, start, quit left aligned well the
graphics designers amongst you might say that

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:90%
we need to put some kind of panel behind here
but this is good enough for now, and I think

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to use the same font size for start
and quit so I'm going to go to 62, OK, and

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.079 align:middle line:90%
that's fine. So let's just take a look at
the game so far, run it through and see how

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:84%
it's feeling.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:41.899 align:middle line:90%
Ouch, now I don't know about you but that
really hurt my ears, though let me show you

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
how to turn the sound down so you just click
on the load sound on the splash scene, 25%.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:56.519 align:middle line:90%
Loads automatically, nice! Glitch Garden,
start, we're chopping the start off OK again

00:12:56.519 --> 00:13:03.829 align:middle line:90%
let's detach the game and see how this scales.
How's the text that's OK, look how the text

00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:90%
is staying. It's staying in the same place
because of the way the anchors are set up

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.579 align:middle line:90%
it's working fine. All I need to do now on
the start scene is give enough room in this

00:13:12.579 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:90%
element, this UI element for the word start
and then that's all just fine so the anchoring

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:90%
is all working OK just fine over here, we
don't have to worry about anything, we don't

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:90%
have to change any of the overflow, of anything
else over here because the anchoring has just

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.779 align:middle line:90%
worked fine, that's to do with these anchors
set up here; but by default they're working

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
fine.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:90%
If you're having a problem then play with
the anchoring system here, and with the anchoring

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.779 align:middle line:90%
positions but you shouldn't need to. I think
you can get into this position now where regardless

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:47.760 align:middle line:90%
of your aspect ratio, whether you're at 4:3
or all the way up at 16:9 the text stays where

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:90%
it is on the image and the black bars came
in which kind of gives a movie feel to it.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:90%
So, congratulations on getting all that done
and I'll see you in the next video.
