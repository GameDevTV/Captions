00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, just before I start this video, I want to point out a couple of

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
things. Firstly, I want to say thank you to Rafael

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who has posted a detailed post here, over in

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the discussions against this lecture, explaining how

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if you want to you don't need to install the entire Android

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Studio; you can just install the Android SDK.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, just in case his discussion item gets removed,

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
for some reason in Udemy, I've also attached a screenshot

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of this long discussion post against this lecture, in

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the resources against the lecture where you do your downloads.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So if you want, you can follow those instructions,

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and just download and install the SDK for simplicity,

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
if you're pushed for space, but if you're not sure about

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
any of that, just carry on, follow my instructions, and download the whole of Android

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Studio. That will work for you just as well! The other thing I wanted

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to say was that, my sound quality is going to change

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
sharply in just a second, because the rest of this video is recorded with

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
a different type of mic because I actually

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
hold a mobile phone and

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
show you that, so I have a different mic. OK, see you soon!

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So, we're going to be setting up the Build Settings

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
for Android, actually deploying to an Android device,

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which I'm really excited about, because it's so satisfying when you get

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to feel a game on a device, even though you can imagine it,

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it's just different. And then, we'll be doing a little bit of

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
play testing on the device. Now, you're going to need your Android

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
device connected to your computer, via

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a USB cable. So,

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
let's get on with it!

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
OK, let's start by getting Developer Mode enabled

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
on your Android phone, because we're going to need that for it

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to work properly. So, here we have my

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Google Nexus 4 Android phone,

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and what I'm going to do is show you, in case you haven't already

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
done it, how to get Developer Mode enabled. Well, go to Settings,

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and this will look a little different if you're in a previous version of Android

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but the same idea, you're typical Settings Menu.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And at the bottom of your Settings Menu, you're going to have

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
an About Phone option.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Click on that and go to the bottom, where it says Build number, and just keep

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
clicking and eventually it'll pop up. Now, for me it says "No need, you

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
are already a developer." But in your case, if you click enough times, I think

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's five, it should say Developer Mode Enabled. Awesome!

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So then, you go back, and then you'll have this

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Developer Options option. Go

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
into that, turn on the Developer Settings,

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and then, you want USB

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Debugging. That's the one you want there.

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Allow USB debugging.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
OK, so Developer Options on, USB Debugging

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is on, and you'll get a notification similar to this. USB Debugging connected.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Perfect! If you're in that state,

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
your phone is ready to receive the game from Unity,

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
when we get there. So, let's go over to Unity

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and take a look at what we need to do at that end.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So, here we are back in Unity! Go to

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
File and Build Settings. Click on

58
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Android, and then Switch Platform here,

59
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
at the bottom left of the Build Settings.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now, you'll get a certain amount of compilations and

61
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
asset re-importing going on. One of the things it's doing

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
here is making sure, for instance, all your music files are in an Android

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
compatible format. Android

64
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is a little more compatible than iOS. When we get to iOS you need

65
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to make sure that you have no .ogg files, in your sound.

66
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
OK cool! So that's done! All these settings on the right hand

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
side, we can leave. Player settings, however, we want to check.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
A couple of things that do need to be changed,

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I would change at least your Product Name,

70
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
because that's what's going

71
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to be on your logo, on your actual app.

72
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So, change your Product Name. Then, make sure that

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the Android Button is depressed here, on the target platforms,

74
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and let's just look up through. Resolution and Presentation

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
firstly. We don't want Portrait, so

76
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
uptick both of the Portrait options. This game is not designed

77
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to be Portrait. Everything else can stay the same.

78
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Icon, if you want you can put yourself an

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Icon in. I'm not going to be doing that for this example.

80
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Splash Image, we can't change the Splash Image on the

81
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
free version of Unity, anyway, but we have made a workaround, as we showed

82
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
you. Other settings, nothing to do

83
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
at the top under Rendering, but under other settings

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Identification is critical, but you set your

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Bundle Identifier. If you don't do that it won't work.

86
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So, use something like your name. I'm going to use my company name,

87
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
or use your company name, if you have one.

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And the, .GlitchGarden.

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So, you can just put com.myname and you can even

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
say myname.GlitchGarden or

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
put your name in there or your company name. OK, that's the important

92
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
bit that the Bundle Identifier matches that pattern, put com

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
.name.GlitchGarden. Perfect!

94
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Everything else on there you can leave the same, and again, with the

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Publishing Settings, nothing needs changing. Let's just

96
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
click Build and Run and see what happens.

97
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Save it somewhere sensible, on your computer,

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
in case you want to keep that Android Build,

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and then, just let Unity

100
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
do its thing.

101
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So, it's compiling your assets, it's building

102
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
a target package, etc., etc.

103
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And then, pushing new content

104
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
to device, and it's found my Nexus 4.

105
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And if you have any problems here, make sure your USB cable is

106
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
connected directly and that you're definitely in

107
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
this USB Debugging mode, on your machine.

108
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Now, your Android may become unresponsive for a minute,

109
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
while it pushes the app onto it. That's happening to mine

110
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
right now. It's not responding to my presses, but

111
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
it'll actually just load the game.

112
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Here we go! Get ready for it! It"s going to be exciting! I'm going to turn the

113
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
sound up a bit.

114
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
[Game Music Playing in Background] There we go! That

115
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
was the sound of Glitch Garden loading, and there it

116
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is. Now, if we click the Quit Button, should it

117
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
find it actually quits, because we have that quit request actually doing

118
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
something. Now, we're on our platform!

119
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Again, let's find where it is on the Android device.

120
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
If you go to your Apps Button, you'll find,

121
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
if you called it Glitch Garden, it's there under the G's with a default Unity

122
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
logo. If you changed the logo in the Build Settings,

123
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
then it'll give you the logo you changed it to. Click on it,

124
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
watch it rotate very brief

125
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Unity Splash Screen, then our Splash Screen,

126
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
then the Options Screen, and then

127
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
we can turn the volume up. And let's just

128
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
test that turning that volume up to maximum actually persists.

129
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So, let's quit the game.

130
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Now remember, this initial sound is designed to

131
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
be the same, every time, so that we can get our System

132
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Volume right. And then the Game Volume, let's see!

133
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yes, we've written to Player Prefs on the phone! It's

134
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
staying maximum. Awesome!

135
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So, let's just have a go at the game, and see if there are any obvious things that need fixing.

136
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
[Game Music Playing in Background] Here it is,

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Glitch Garden running on my Android! By the way, you don't need to be tethered

138
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
anymore, the app is now on your phone, and you can go running

139
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
around the country side, showing all your friends.

140
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Look at this! I hope you feel proud of yourself,

141
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that you've got your creation on an actual phone.

142
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
[Game Music Playing in Background]

143
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Pretty cool! Now, one thing you will notice is, you can't

144
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
get out of this very easily. The Back Button doesn't do anything,

145
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and if we go back to the Home Screen

146
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and then back into Glitch Garden,

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
we're just going to end up where we stayed. So,

148
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
make yourself a note, right now, of Glitch Garden improvements.

149
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
One to me is that, we need to make sure that we create a Pause

150
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Menu and a way of players getting out of it. The other thing to

151
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
check, if you do want to reset the game, click

152
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
your Multitasking Button and swipe away Glitch Garden

153
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
like this. So, this Multitasking Button here with

154
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
my little finger, then swipe away. Now,

155
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
you can reload. If you're wondering what that background

156
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is, I have if this then that, if T T T,

157
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
changed to a NASA image that some dude in

158
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
a space station, which is pretty cool! So,

159
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
go back into it. Now look, does the Back Button cause a problem

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
at this stage? No. And does the Back Button cause

161
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the problem at this stage? No, but thank you to

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
one of our students for asking that question. It's a very good question.

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It's not causing us a problem. Alright, so the only improvement we

164
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
have to record is that, we need to

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
make sure that we create some sort of way of quitting the game.

166
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So congratulations on actually

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
building your game to Android! That's a huge achievement! Hopefully it's really

168
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
satisfying. I want you now to make sure that you have

169
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
actually done this yourself, so get it running on your device!

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Excitedly run away and show somebody, anybody

171
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
even on the street. Capture a screenshot! Remember on

172
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Android how you capture a screenshot? If you're not sure let

173
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
me just very briefly show you. So, back into the game.

174
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Depending on your device, I'm pretty sure all Android

175
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
devices, you hold down the Power Button, up here, and the Volume

176
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Down Button down there. And if you just hold those down together,

177
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Power and Volume Down, you get a flash and that screenshot

178
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is now in your Gallery, on your Android device.

179
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
It should then be a simple matter to get that onto your

180
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
computer by e-mail or whatever, and then share it with

181
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
the discussions group. I want to see actual deployed

182
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
games OK, so share it in the discussions. Also, share

183
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
it on the Facebook group. We have a very friendly group, over here.

184
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
At Facebook.com/groups/

185
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
completeunitydeveloper. Submit your photo, if you want

186
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
to be part of this group, as well. I update the collage every week or so.

187
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
This group is being run by a couple

188
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
of our students, which is fantastic of them both, Joshua,

189
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Josh Farrow is running it! Also, Robert

190
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
here, Robert Marcum is another Admin on the group.

191
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He's helping to run the community. But do post your

192
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
game on here, as well, or your screenshot,

193
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
because the idea of this group is to share

194
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
not only with other students but with people, your general friends on

195
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Facebook. Invite them into the group, share your ideas with them,

196
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and that's the next step, after sharing with the discussions.

197
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The next step is to go even more public by sharing

198
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
with everybody in this group. Bring your friends into this group,

199
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
get their feedback, and also, they may have ideas about what game

200
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
you should be creating. So well done!

201
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
There's your challenge,

202
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I've shown you how to do it. I'll leave you to it.

203
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
See you soon!
