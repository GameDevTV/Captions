00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.566
Hi. Sam here again. and I am going to be showing you how to upgrade

2
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:12.566
to Unity 5. in this lecture. for Glitch Garden.

3
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.000
But first.

4
00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:19.033
a challenge! You guys should be fairly used to

5
00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:23.033
upgrading. by this point. We've done it a couple of times. and I'd like you to have a go at doing it

6
00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:27.033
yourself and doing the Web GL build and sharing all by yourself.

7
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:31.033
So. check your game in Unity 5. carefully. as usual.

8
00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:35.033
and then. make a Web GL Build. all using the instructions

9
00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.033
that we've done in the past. and share using Game Bucket.

10
00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:43.033
OK. so pause the video and have a go at that. and if you get stuck. you can come back

11
00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:47.033
and watch the solution.

12
00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:51.033
OK. welcome back! We're going to dive in

13
00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:55.033
and have a little play around and see what has changed.

14
00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:59.033
what Unity 5 upgrade will do to change our Glitch Garden project.

15
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:03.966
So. you guys know the drill. We are going to open up Unity

16
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:07.966
5. and then. when we have this open.

17
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.966
we are going to go and find our Glitch Garden folder

18
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.966
and open that. And as usual.

19
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.966
we will be prompted to upgrade. and as you can see. it's

20
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.966
not warning us about changes to the API we're needing to backup and that's fine.

21
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.966
Basically. the code in Glitch Garden is ready to go as it

22
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:31.966
stands. It's ready to be upgraded to Unity 5. there's no API changes.

23
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.966
and so really it's not changing a whole lot.

24
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:39.966
We just have a few asset files that it will change

25
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:43.966
and so on. So. we'll see that in just a second. when we take a look

26
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:47.966
at the SourceTree for this project. So. in fact. let me just go amd

27
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:51.966
open up SourceTree now. and I'm going to

28
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:55.966
open up the Glitch Garden. which is what we have here. Just

29
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:59.966
make sure it is the right Glitch Garden folder.

30
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:03.966
Yes! And we can have a look

31
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:07.966
at the uncomitted changes. So. I'll bring the Unity over. As you can see.

32
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:11.966
it's on the blank scene at the moment. so if we go and

33
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:15.966
select our splash screen and hit play...

34
00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:19.966
[Background Music Plays] There we go. we have our splashscreen sound. and

35
00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:23.966
then. the game starts and we can select

36
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:27.966
our defenders and place them in. ready for

37
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:31.966
the attackers. which will soon be arriving. There

38
00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:35.966
we go! As we can see. perfect! So. everything seems to be working

39
00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:39.966
properly. Obviously. test it more thoroughly than that. before releasing it

40
00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:42.500
with your own version. Let's go to Source

41
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Tree and see what has changed. So

42
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.500
here. as you can see. it's mostly just the asset files and the Project

43
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.500
Version.txt. as we have seen in the past. So. nothing

44
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.500
huge. no big changes here. So. what we can do is

45
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.500
head on back over into Unity and go into our build.

46
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.500
And I'll bring it over from the other screen.

47
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.500
WebGL and then we just hit

48
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Build. As usual. we'll need to create our Build folder.

49
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500
and give

50
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.500
this build a name

51
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.500
and hit Save. And then we have to wait

52
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.500
for the build to run. Once that is finished. we can zip that

53
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.500
up and uplaode it to Game Bucket or any other sharing service

54
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.500
that you're going to be using. And you cna share it on Facebook. we can share it in

55
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.500
the Q & A. etc. OK. so we'll leave it there and leave the

56
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.833
last few steps up to you and see you in the next video!
