00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So you made it to the end of Glitch Garden

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and congratulations! So. Brice. there's a summary of what they have

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
learned? So. you've learned lots of really cool stuff in Glitch Garden!

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Firstly. you've gone through the animation framework. You know how to

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
animate positions. which we've learned previously. and

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
also use sprite animation in the Animator.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That's awesome. that lets you do lots of cool stuff for

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
your 2D games. You've also learned a lot more about structuring your

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
game. how to use different ways of putting components

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
together. how to refer back and forth between components inside your game.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So. lots of really cool coding stuff that you've learned

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in Glitch Garden. So. what's the next action?

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Ben. what should they be doing now with their new glitch game? Well. hopefully you've

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
already shared it on gamebucket.io. and all the people

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
on Udemy are going crazy about how cool your game is.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Hopefully you're going to go and find some other art assets. and if you're really ambitious

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
make your own art assets and really customize up the game.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We'd love you to make new animal types. new attacker

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
types. and new defender types as

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
well. Add them to the game. give them new types of behavior. Let's give

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you a couple of ideas. We have a fox jumping over. Maybe we have something

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that burrows under and you make an animation for that. Maybe you have a

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
whole new type of attacker. maybe somebody that can fire over.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Lots of different things. Have a look at Plants Versus Zombies for inspiration.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'd love to see a land mine that

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
blows up people that walk over it. as a defense. as well

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
as a flying creature that can avoid the land mine. when you attack

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
with it. Awesome! There you go. two more ideas! So. really mix

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it up. use the component architecture we've shown you. really make

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
this thing extendable and pretty cool! Hopefully you've already

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
deployed it to the web. I would like you to try and deploy it to mobile.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's whatever suits you. so if you haven't got a Mac you're

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
going to be better off trying to deploy to Android. If you've got a Mac

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Android or iOS. At least get it as far as the iOS Simulator.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
if you can. if you have a Mac. If you

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
can't do either of those. or you don't have the development environment

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
setup where you don't want to. then check out the Unity Remote on

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the app store. for both Apple and Android. and that's going to allow

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you. with a bit of fiddling. to go in as we've shown you and

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
play from the editor straight to the phone. It kind of streams the game

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to the phone. The frame rate is a bit low. the interactivity is not like a native app.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but it's a great way of previewing how your game is going to look. It's really important

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
actually. It's really important to test your game on the platform that you're going

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to be running it on. It's very difficult sometimes to be in the simulator

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
on your PC and figure out really. is that how the

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
experience feels for the player. So. you've got the PC and you can click

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
with your mouse. but the experience isn't the same as when you've got it in your hand.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so try it out and have fun doing it. Absolutely. only one of the

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
things you immediately come up against is the size of this right. the end of your finger.

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You may have to adjust buttons. adjust the UI Elements around buttons.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
etc. Sausage finger. Sausage finger people.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This is the last 2D game that we're doing

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
in the course. then we're moving into 3D with Hyper

54
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Paddle. and then beyond in other courses. So. thank you for

55
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
getting this far! It's an awesome job if you've got this far. especially

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
if you started from nothing. Wherever you started. Well done

57
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and we'll see you soon! Bye.
