00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Hey guys I don't know about you but I'm feeling
really good about the way that this is coming

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.150 align:middle line:90%
on now. it's really starting to pull together
as a proper game so. well I say a game. at

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.030 align:middle line:84%
least a menu system for a game.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:90%
What I'd like to be able to do is create a
fade-in from the intro screen here I want

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.589 align:middle line:90%
this to fade in not just bang but fade up
and we're going to be able to re-use that

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:90%
fading functionality in other places. This
is about just finishing the polish of this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.829 align:middle line:90%
system. So what are we going to do in this
video?

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:90%
We're going to add a nice fade-in to this
start scene. I'm going to give up completely

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:90%
on trying to spell lose or loose properly
because it's just not working. we're going

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:90%
to add a background image to the levels a
grass for our play scene and check that it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.989 align:middle line:84%
all flows really nicely before moving on.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:90%
OK so let's get on with that. So how are we
going to do fading? Well. sorry to say. you're

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:90%
going to work it out. You're brave. you're
going to work it out. Have a go for yourself.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.219 align:middle line:90%
what I want you to do is make the start scene
fade in over a variable amount of time.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Try it your way. it's great learning to try
to see and explore the different ways. Use

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:90%
google. think of ways of doing it. I'm going
to give you a couple of hints. I'll be using

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:90%
a UI panel and adjusting its alpha and if
you're wondering where to place the script

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:90%
then why not on that very panel. So there's
enough hints. enough ideas there why don't

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:90%
you see if you can get the start scene fading
in over a couple of seconds?

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Pause the video. have a good go at that now.
and when you're ready to see how I do it just

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:84%
carry on.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:90%
OK welcome back so it's time for me to show
you how I'm going to achieve my fade. So we

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:90%
go to the scene in question which is the start
scene; open up the canvas and let's add ourselves

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:90%
a UI panel. Perfect. Where is that panel?
Well it's sitting right over the top of everything.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go into my UI mode and literally
put this over the top of the entire canvas.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Like so.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:90%
There it is. That is my panel covering my
entire canvas. So. what am I going to do with

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:90%
that panel. Well. let's set its colour to
black and its transparency to 255. its alpha

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.450 align:middle line:90%
to 255 so fully opaque. Now you can't see
anything. Now where it is in the hierarchy

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.099 align:middle line:90%
does that make a difference? Well it does
in the case of the UI elements so you are

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:90%
going to want this at the very bottom of your
canvas like that.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.049 align:middle line:90%
So fantastic we have now a blank. useless
start screen but. this is the start state.

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:90%
this is how we want to start and then we want
it to fade through. so it's the alpha that

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.379 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be changing on this guy so
let's add a component. a script straight on

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.569 align:middle line:90%
the panel itself and let's call it. well.
fade in. Maybe later we'll generalise this

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:90%
a little more. make it a fade in/fade out
script but for now all it does is fade in

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
so we should call it fade in.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Scripts. organise the scripts into the scripts
folder. and let's take a look. So. how are

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:90%
we going to achieve a fade in. Well. good
question. what would the public variable that

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:90%
we need to expose be for a start? Well I suggest
that it's something to do with the amount

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:90%
of time that it fades over right. so why don't
we start with a public float and what would

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.909 align:middle line:90%
we call it? Have a think about the name. I'm
not just going to tell you the name for two

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.709 align:middle line:90%
seconds. what would you call it? Naming is
everything. Well. FadeInTime. You could say

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:90%
FadeInTime in seconds. so what are we going
to need in order to be able to control this?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.909 align:middle line:90%
Well. privately we're going to need to have
an image; that's a UI image.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:32.069 align:middle line:90%
Now why does image not come up in my list?
Because we need to import the UnityEngine.UI

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.969 align:middle line:90%
namespace. Great. So now we can say private
image and it'll work; and what are we going

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.689 align:middle line:90%
to call this image? Well. I'm going to call
it FadePanel. OK? Pretty unimaginatively.

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:90%
You know. if it's a dog. call it a dog. If
it's a cat call it a cat. private. what else

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:90%
do we need here? Well. we're going to need
a colour. Why? Because in C# you may have

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.669 align:middle line:90%
noticed that often you need to pass methods
complete objects like you need to form your

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.579 align:middle line:90%
vectors before you pass them in. In the same
way we need to fully form our colour before

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.779 align:middle line:84%
we pass it into the panel.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to need a private colour. and
I'm going to call it currentColour. because

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:90%
it's going to change every frame. right? Now
do I put a "u" in my colour? Oh here's a dilemma.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.669 align:middle line:90%
how long do we spend considering this. Unity
don't put a 'u' because they're heathens and

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.780 align:middle line:90%
they're American. I'm English and I like 'u's
I'm going to leave it consistent with Unity.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:90%
how's that? I'm giving up the flag for the
sake of being consistent with that dodgy American

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
spelling.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:90%
So what do we start the colour with? We start
it with color.black so we don't necessarily

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:90%
have to set it in the inspector because we
are initialising here. OK. that's fine so

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:90%
on the Start. what are we going to do? We're
going to find that fade panel. Let's just

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:90%
go back to Unity and make sure that we understand
what we're talking about. If you look at the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:90%
panel. I'm adding a script. I want to find
the actual image component - this bit - this

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:90%
image script here and it's this colour that
I'm going to change and what I want to do

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:90%
in script is have the effect of dragging this
alpha slider. you see?

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:90%
As I drag it it starts to appear. Perfect.
so that's the control that I want from script.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:90%
So the way that I need to do that is I need
to get component image from within my script.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting another component off a different
component on the same gameObject and it's

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:90%
of type image so fadePanel equals GetComponent.
and I'm going to use the chevron format type

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:90%
image. and then it's a method so it needs
squigglies. Fantastic.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Alright. so on the update. what are we going
to say? Well basically. we do something when

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Time.timeSinceLevelLoad OK time since level
loaded when that is less than the fade in

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:90%
time then we do something. What are we going
to do? Well. put a comment in for the moment.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Fade in. Basically; and then what do we do
otherwise? Well. this is quite important.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Once that fade-in has finished we're going
to need to de-activate the panel. otherwise

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to be able to click anything.
You see right now you wouldn't be able to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:90%
click any of these objects. We're going to
need to deactivate it which has the same effect

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
as clicking this tick.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:90%
So it will go from black through the alpha
over the period of two seconds. or however

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:90%
long you set to white and then it will disable
so that we can click the buttons below and

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:90%
it's out of the way. So that's the pattern
that we're going for. So else gameObject.SetActive

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:90%
false. That's setting active false is unticking
this box effectively.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Cool. so now all we need to do is write the
fading code. Ah. come on. I've got to challenge

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:90%
you to do this at this point. surely. How
about you write it? It's three lines. well

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:90%
I've done it in three lines. and it's relatively
simple it involves the currentColour.a and

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:90%
a bit of Time.DeltaTime and a bit of division
and stuffs. Have a go. see if you can write

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.890 align:middle line:90%
this fade-in code and make it work. If you
can't. don't beat yourself up. just come straight

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
back and I'll show you how.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Awesome. so I'm going to define an intermediate
variable called alphaChange so we can see

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:90%
what we're doing. So alphaChange is what?
Well. in this frame we need Time.DeltaTime

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:90%
s that could be a few milliseconds. typically
it's going to be something like fifty milliseconds

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:90%
or whatever. depends how fast the framerate
of the game is at the moment. Divided by fadeInTime.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:90%
yeah? So that's how much change we need this
frame. Time.DeltaTime over the fadeInTime.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:90%
So if it's a two second frame. and the fade
in time is two seconds. then you would have

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:90%
a hundred percent alpha change. If the fade
in time was say two seconds but we had a tenth

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:90%
of a second frame then we would have twenty.
we would only want a twentieth of the fade

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:90%
to happen this frame. Does that make sense?
It's just the proportion of the fade that

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:84%
we want to happen this frame.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Fine. so now we go currentColor.a we take
its alpha channel off and we reduce it by

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:90%
the thing we just made. alphaChange. So we
reduce the alpha and then we set the fadePanel.color.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:90%
No we can't do it all in one step in C# unfortunately.
Equals currentColor. Anyway this reads really

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:90%
nice and clear. So. hopefully. that works.
OK. let's have a go. I'm going to start on

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.890 align:middle line:90%
my splash screen. Hang on. back to your start.
remember to set your parameter. Under your

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:90%
panel here. and I'm going to call it fade
panel. Fade in time of how long shall we go

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:90%
for? Well shall we try three seconds? The
same fade in as the fade out on the splash

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:35.019 align:middle line:90%
screen? ie the delay on the splash screen?
Let's try.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:39.189 align:middle line:90%
Looks good. apart from my panel positioning
is wrong. So lets take a look at what's up

00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:90%
with our fade panel. Well. for me what's happened
is that when I first added the fade panel

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:90%
it subtly came in as completely the wrong
type of image. It came in as a sliced image

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:90%
so let's set it to simple. Before I do though.
the clue is here up in the size of the rect

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%
transform. It's 283 by 19 pixels so that's
a bit weird. it's all sliced and stretched

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:90%
let's just set it to a simple image. That's
starting to help. Now if we play with the

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:12.009 align:middle line:90%
alpha for a second of this image. you'll see
that its got a kind of oval background and

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:90%
that's because it's a background image. We
don't want an image so that's the second thing

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to fix.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.079 align:middle line:90%
Now that option has gone away. Because there's
no image if you set the image then you get

00:09:21.079 --> 00:09:25.639 align:middle line:90%
the image type slice but as soon as we take
the image away there is no option any more

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:30.079 align:middle line:90%
so we're much closer to where we want to be.
It kind of looked OK in the preview by luck

00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:84%
before but this is set up properly.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:90%
The final thing we want to do is actually
explicitly set the size of this image to the

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:42.889 align:middle line:90%
1600 by 900 that we're talking about. It's
still not working. so why is that not working?

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:47.209 align:middle line:90%
Well. you've got a little tiny element up
here and you've got a really strange position

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:90%
you've got stretching set. you've got really
weird settings in this rect transform. Just

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:90%
reset the rect transform. there you go. There
it is in the middle. now all we need to do

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
is set the 1600 by 900.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.829 align:middle line:90%
So they're the sort of things you may need
to go through and align the image. OK? So

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:90%
if in doubt trying to add a simple panel like
this. reset your rect transform. set the resolution

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%
explicitly and make sure there is no source
image. Now we're in business. let's have a

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:17.339 align:middle line:84%
look.

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:21.069 align:middle line:90%
So I reduced the music volume and delay so
it went through quickly. final thing of course

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:26.309 align:middle line:90%
that I forgot to do was just to add the script
back - fade in script over I'm going to make

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:32.569 align:middle line:90%
it two seconds. I think that three is too
long. let's try that for effect.

00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Whip through that. one. two and then it works.
Fantastic. let's try starting the game. So

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:50.079 align:middle line:90%
where's my start button taking me. let's have
a quick look at that. Where's the start button

00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:90%
wired to? It's wired to start. Well we don't
want it wired to start. we want it wired to

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:90%
02 level 01. Now. we have a problem here.
This is different to the prefab. the thing

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:09.449 align:middle line:90%
is we've prefabbed a start button and it's
doing two different things. This start button

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:90%
is taking us to level 1 and our prefab start
button which we use on the win screen and

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
the lose screen is taking us back to the start.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.459 align:middle line:90%
So why don't we change the name of one of
them? Why don't we just change this one on

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:30.199 align:middle line:90%
the front scene here instead of being called
start. it's a play button now. OK? So play

00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:38.999 align:middle line:90%
button and it's not. it's nothing to do with
the prefab any more. So it would actually

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:90%
be better to disconnect it from the prefab.
The easiest way to do that would be to duplicate

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:49.259 align:middle line:90%
the options button. remove the play button
altogether and then just call it play button.

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Because it's nothing to do with the prefab.
that's where the confusion is coming in.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:02.149 align:middle line:90%
OK so again. naming. So many issues around
naming. right? Play Game. and then simply

00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:07.819 align:middle line:90%
whip out the UI size. make sure that the play
game's script is wired to the right place.

00:12:07.819 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:90%
which is 02 level 01. that's fine. Now lets
just try it all.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:22.139 align:middle line:90%
So wait for that fade to finish. play game
lose condition. you moose. start takes you

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:90%
back here. play game win condition. you win.
Fantastic. So we have a nice simple fade script

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.869 align:middle line:90%
that we can use on any UI image panel and
we can apply that same technique to any level.

00:12:35.869 --> 00:12:39.059 align:middle line:90%
We didn't quite get around to adding the grass
to the levels but that's fine. we'll do that

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:90%
in a subsequent video. because we need to
think a little bit carefully about our scaling

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.759 align:middle line:90%
mode for all of the levels and how we're going
to deal with that. congratulations on getting

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:51.759 align:middle line:84%
this far. and I shall see you soon.
