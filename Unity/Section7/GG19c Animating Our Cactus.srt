2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.700
So welcome to Animating our Cactus! In this video

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.700
we'll be animating the cactus from scratch and recapping the 5-step process!

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.700
So let's dive in! So let's take a look at the Star

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.700
Trophy now. make sure that is working OK. We're going to move him over next to the Lizard.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.700
Ooh. I've just moved the Top. Make sure. if you're moving the Star Trophy. of course. that you move the entire

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.700
thing. Now the Star Trophy already has this parent child relationship.

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.700
so we can put him precisely on grid at 4. 3. and then. we

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.700
can use the fact that the Top and the Base are child objects to

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.700
just adjust that position slightly. Now. let's make sure we're obeying our rules.

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.700
We have an animator at the top level. and we have. actually in this case. two body

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.700
objects. which is fine because we're making a bone based animation. Cool!

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.700
Let's go take a look! The Idle animation. how is that working? Well it's a

14
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.700
bone based animation that we've already setup. and it lasts a total of 4

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.700
seconds. so we're going to be in there for 4 seconds. that's OK. And then. the

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Star Birth. let's take a look at that. that lasts a total of 4 seconds

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.700
as well. So the Star Trophy should already be going from Idle

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.700
for 4 seconds to Star Birth

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
and then back to Idle. So let's just check these transition arrows. At the moment.

20
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.700
we've got 5 cycles before we leave. that's a lot. So I'm making

21
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.700
sure that we're not playing when we adjust the Exit Time. 1 cycle Exit Time.

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.700
Let's try that now! So we should get a

23
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.700
single cycle of the star going left and right. and then. a transition over to

24
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700
Star Birth. That's absolutely fine! So this star is up and running!

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.700
Good. we've already done a load of the work! Now. before I continue and start adding other defenders

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.700
and attackers. I just want to do a couple of things to make it tidier. I'm going to create another

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.700
empty game object called Attackers.

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.700
I'm going to put this at 0. 0. 0. and then. I'm just going to put the

29
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.700
Lizard into Attackers. And I'm going to make another empty. at the root. must

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.700
be at the root. So this guy. that I just made. is at the root. just be careful you

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.700
make it at the root. Call it Defenders.

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
set it to 0. and then put the Star Trophy in. So all we've done here is

33
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700
organized our Attackers and Defenders together. Fantastic! So now it's

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.700
time to start composing our second object. Now you've seen how to do both Sprite Based Animation.

35
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.700
with the Lizard. and Bone Based Animation. with the Star Trophy. It's

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.700
time to crack out the third type of character. So which

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.700
should we go for next? Well let's go look at our Asset Pack! So over

38
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.700
here in the section assets. that you would have downloaded. I'm using version 8 in this video.

39
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.700
You can open the Unity package. and what it'll do

40
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.700
for you is. it will detect the assets that are not already in your game. only

41
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.700
the ones that aren't. and it'll allow you to import them. Well let's just go ahead and do that!

42
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.700
And in they come! Now suddenly.

43
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.700
we've got all the things we need organized into folders. We've got a Cactus. a

44
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.700
Fox. and a Gnome. etc.. etc. So why don't we just start at

45
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.700
the top? Let's have a Cactus! OK. now I will set this entire

46
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.700
Cactus up from scratch to you. according to the new scheme. and then. I will challenge you

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.700
to do the next one. So the Cactus is what? Well it's a Defender!

48
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.700
So let's make an empty object. let's call it Cactus.

49
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.700
Let's decide where in the scene we're going to put it. somewhere

50
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.700
on grid. 3. 2 will be fine or 4

51
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.700
2. just so it's below the other Defender. OK fine! Now. we

52
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.700
said that for all of these we want a separate sub-body

53
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.700
object. Now the Cactus is going to have an Idle sprite sheet animation. so I'm

54
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.700
going to call this Body.

55
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.700
I'm going to add a Sprite Renderer to the body.

56
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.700
and at the Cactus. just like on the Lizard we have an Animator. We need a

57
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.700
Animator on the Cactus.

58
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.700
OK. that's fantastic! Now. remember the Lizard had an Animator

59
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.700
Controller? Well we're going to need one of those. so let's make ourselves.

60
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.700
in the Cactus Animations folder an Animator Controller.

61
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.700
Call it Cactus. which is consistent with

62
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.700
the Lizard. Now you may want to call it underscore Cactus. like I did before. because that

63
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.700
just makes it float to the start of the folder. and it's kind of the root

64
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.700
object of the folder. so that makes sense. Now. the Cactus here.

65
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.700
in the root Cactus object. we can give it an Animator Controller. So now let's

66
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.700
give ourselves a default sprite. I'll use the first frame. so I've

67
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.700
clicked on the Cactus body now. and against the Sprite Renderer

68
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.700
I'm popping the Cactus Idle frame. Ah. there we go!

69
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.700
We have a Cactus Idle! Now if this is too big for your taste. of course. with the body

70
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.700
element selected. another benefit of having a separate body element is you can do some scaling.

71
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.700
And all this positioning and scaling has happened without. at the Cactus level. changing

72
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.700
the fact the Cactus is nicely on grid. which our code is going to be very

73
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.700
pleased with. Fantastic! Let's go into the animation! Let's

74
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.700
create a new clip. let's call it the same as the names

75
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.700
down here in the Assets. so I'm going to call it Idle to start with.

76
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.700
We're going to add a curve. drilling into the body remember. then the Sprite Renderer.

77
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.700
and then. Sprite. It comes up with a default couple of frames. we're used to that.

78
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.700
Select all the frames that we want. drop them in. Remove

79
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.700
the frames it came with by default. move the rest across to the left. and then

80
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.700
have a look at the time-frame. We want this to animate for about 3

81
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.700
seconds. We have a frame-rate of 60. That's very high. let's look at see if it's

82
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.700
OK. Does it look OK? I think it does for that!

83
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.700
So how long is this lasting? Well it's 60 frames

84
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.700
a second. We've got. I'm not sure how many frames but you can see

85
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.700
that this animation cycle is lasting about 3/4

86
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.700
of a second. so we're going to want

87
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.700
about 4 of these. in order to get the right times. So

88
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.700
in the Animator. we're going to go from Idle to the next state. after about

89
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.700
4 cycles. but we're not quite ready to do that yet. because we need the next state to be

90
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.700
ready. So how are we going to do that? Well we can come here and create a new clip. What's

91
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.700
the new clip going to be called? Well what's it called in the

92
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.700
Assets? It's called attack. so why don't we call it Attack!

93
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.700
So create a new clip. call it

94
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.700
Attack. Now look over in your

95
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.700
Animator and you'll see it's made an Attack state here. And let's

96
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.700
make the transition from Idle to Attack. We set it

97
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.700
once to go. I think after about 4. Let's just test that! So

98
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.700
1.000. 2.000. 3.000. and it stops. That's about

99
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.700
right. Fantastic! Now Attack needs to do something. so

100
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.700
it's the same as before right. We Add a Curve to the Body. because

101
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.700
the Animator is controlling the sub-object. We're going to swap out the sprite. we're going to

102
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.700
leave the default frames there. Loads of frames in this Attack animation.

103
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.700
select all of them except for the last blank ones. We don't want those blank ones. Drop

104
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.700
them in. get rid of the frames it started with. Control

105
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.700
A or Box Select. Have a little look at how long this is. it's a minute and 10

106
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.700
seconds. so we want to come out after about 3 cycles. I'm being rough with these

107
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.700
cycle times and that's absolutely fine! So we want to go from Attack back

108
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.700
to Idle. after about 3 cycles. Let's

109
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.700
see how this look! So about 1.000. 2.000.

110
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.700
3.000. then 1.000... Ooh. so he's not doing 3 full

111
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.700
cycles. Let's check the return condition. it didn't remember that. Remember that when you

112
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.700
set your exit time. you must hit Return and not be in Play Mode.

113
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.700
Let's try that again! 1.000. 2.000. 3.000.

114
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.700
1.000. 2.000. 3.000. He's just going back and forth.

115
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.700
Awesome. so finally the Cactus is a Defender. so I'm going to drag it under Defenders.

116
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.700
And we have some structure coming on. we have Attackers. Defenders.

117
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.700
and of course. we're just going to keep repeating this process. Now remember. the

118
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.700
slide that I gave you in the previous video. this one Character Animation

119
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.700
Overview. We create a character parent and child body object. We ensure

120
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.700
that the Animator is on the parent object. We convert the Sprite Sheet into separate

121
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.700
frames. that's been done for you in the Asset Pack. We add a Sprite Renderer

122
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.700
Curve to the body object. and we adjust

123
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.700
animation to taste. So that's what we're going to need to do for everything.

124
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.700
So I want you to animate the rest of the Defenders now. Animate all the other Defenders.

125
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.700
aim for them to cycle every 3 seconds. and if you're stuck. watch me over the

126
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.700
coming videos. So pause the video. have a go at animating the rest of the Defenders now.

127
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.700
and in the next video. this time. I will start to show you my solution.

128
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.600

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700


2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,700
So welcome to Animating our Cactus! In this video

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,700
we'll be animating the cactus from scratch and recapping the 5-step process!

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,700
So let's dive in! So let's take a look at the Star

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,700
Trophy now, make sure that is working OK. We're going to move him over next to the Lizard.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,700
Ooh, I've just moved the Top. Make sure, if you're moving the Star Trophy, of course, that you move the entire

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,700
thing. Now the Star Trophy already has this parent child relationship,

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,700
so we can put him precisely on grid at 4, 3, and then, we

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,700
can use the fact that the Top and the Base are child objects to

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,700
just adjust that position slightly. Now, let's make sure we're obeying our rules.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,700
We have an animator at the top level, and we have, actually in this case, two body

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,700
objects, which is fine because we're making a bone based animation. Cool!

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,700
Let's go take a look! The Idle animation, how is that working? Well it's a

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,700
bone based animation that we've already setup, and it lasts a total of 4

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,700
seconds, so we're going to be in there for 4 seconds, that's OK. And then, the

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,700
Star Birth, let's take a look at that, that lasts a total of 4 seconds

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,700
as well. So the Star Trophy should already be going from Idle

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,700
for 4 seconds to Star Birth

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,700
and then back to Idle. So let's just check these transition arrows. At the moment,

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,700
we've got 5 cycles before we leave, that's a lot. So I'm making

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,700
sure that we're not playing when we adjust the Exit Time, 1 cycle Exit Time.

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Let's try that now! So we should get a

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
single cycle of the star going left and right, and then, a transition over to

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Star Birth. That's absolutely fine! So this star is up and running!

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Good, we've already done a load of the work! Now, before I continue and start adding other defenders

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,700
and attackers, I just want to do a couple of things to make it tidier. I'm going to create another

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,700
empty game object called Attackers.

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,700
I'm going to put this at 0, 0, 0, and then, I'm just going to put the

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Lizard into Attackers. And I'm going to make another empty, at the root, must

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,700
be at the root. So this guy, that I just made, is at the root, just be careful you

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,700
make it at the root. Call it Defenders,

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,700
set it to 0, and then put the Star Trophy in. So all we've done here is

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,700
organized our Attackers and Defenders together. Fantastic! So now it's

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,700
time to start composing our second object. Now you've seen how to do both Sprite Based Animation,

35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,700
with the Lizard, and Bone Based Animation, with the Star Trophy. It's

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,700
time to crack out the third type of character. So which

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,700
should we go for next? Well let's go look at our Asset Pack! So over

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,700
here in the section assets, that you would have downloaded, I'm using version 8 in this video.

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,700
You can open the Unity package, and what it'll do

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,700
for you is, it will detect the assets that are not already in your game, only

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,700
the ones that aren't, and it'll allow you to import them. Well let's just go ahead and do that!

42
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,700
And in they come! Now suddenly,

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,700
we've got all the things we need organized into folders. We've got a Cactus, a

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Fox, and a Gnome, etc., etc. So why don't we just start at

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,700
the top? Let's have a Cactus! OK, now I will set this entire

46
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
Cactus up from scratch to you, according to the new scheme, and then, I will challenge you

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,700
to do the next one. So the Cactus is what? Well it's a Defender!

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,700
So let's make an empty object, let's call it Cactus.

49
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Let's decide where in the scene we're going to put it, somewhere

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,700
on grid, 3, 2 will be fine or 4

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,700
2, just so it's below the other Defender. OK fine! Now, we

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,700
said that for all of these we want a separate sub-body

53
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,700
object. Now the Cactus is going to have an Idle sprite sheet animation, so I'm

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,700
going to call this Body.

55
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,700
I'm going to add a Sprite Renderer to the body,

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,700
and at the Cactus, just like on the Lizard we have an Animator. We need a

57
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Animator on the Cactus.

58
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,700
OK, that's fantastic! Now, remember the Lizard had an Animator

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,700
Controller? Well we're going to need one of those, so let's make ourselves,

60
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,700
in the Cactus Animations folder an Animator Controller.

61
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Call it Cactus, which is consistent with

62
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,700
the Lizard. Now you may want to call it underscore Cactus, like I did before, because that

63
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,700
just makes it float to the start of the folder, and it's kind of the root

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,700
object of the folder, so that makes sense. Now, the Cactus here,

65
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,700
in the root Cactus object, we can give it an Animator Controller. So now let's

66
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,700
give ourselves a default sprite. I'll use the first frame, so I've

67
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,700
clicked on the Cactus body now, and against the Sprite Renderer

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,700
I'm popping the Cactus Idle frame. Ah, there we go!

69
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,700
We have a Cactus Idle! Now if this is too big for your taste, of course, with the body

70
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,700
element selected, another benefit of having a separate body element is you can do some scaling.

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,700
And all this positioning and scaling has happened without, at the Cactus level, changing

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,700
the fact the Cactus is nicely on grid, which our code is going to be very

73
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,700
pleased with. Fantastic! Let's go into the animation! Let's

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,700
create a new clip, let's call it the same as the names

75
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,700
down here in the Assets, so I'm going to call it Idle to start with.

76
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,700
We're going to add a curve, drilling into the body remember, then the Sprite Renderer,

77
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,700
and then, Sprite. It comes up with a default couple of frames, we're used to that.

78
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Select all the frames that we want, drop them in. Remove

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,700
the frames it came with by default, move the rest across to the left, and then

80
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,700
have a look at the time-frame. We want this to animate for about 3

81
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,700
seconds. We have a frame-rate of 60. That's very high, let's look at see if it's

82
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,700
OK. Does it look OK? I think it does for that!

83
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,700
So how long is this lasting? Well it's 60 frames

84
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,700
a second. We've got, I'm not sure how many frames but you can see

85
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,700
that this animation cycle is lasting about 3/4

86
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,700
of a second, so we're going to want

87
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,700
about 4 of these, in order to get the right times. So

88
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,700
in the Animator, we're going to go from Idle to the next state, after about

89
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,700
4 cycles, but we're not quite ready to do that yet, because we need the next state to be

90
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,700
ready. So how are we going to do that? Well we can come here and create a new clip. What's

91
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,700
the new clip going to be called? Well what's it called in the

92
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Assets? It's called attack, so why don't we call it Attack!

93
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,700
So create a new clip, call it

94
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Attack. Now look over in your

95
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Animator and you'll see it's made an Attack state here. And let's

96
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,700
make the transition from Idle to Attack. We set it

97
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,700
once to go, I think after about 4. Let's just test that! So

98
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,700
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and it stops. That's about

99
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,700
right. Fantastic! Now Attack needs to do something, so

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,700
it's the same as before right. We Add a Curve to the Body, because

101
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,700
the Animator is controlling the sub-object. We're going to swap out the sprite, we're going to

102
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,700
leave the default frames there. Loads of frames in this Attack animation,

103
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,700
select all of them except for the last blank ones. We don't want those blank ones. Drop

104
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,700
them in, get rid of the frames it started with, Control

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,700
A or Box Select. Have a little look at how long this is, it's a minute and 10

106
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,700
seconds, so we want to come out after about 3 cycles. I'm being rough with these

107
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,700
cycle times and that's absolutely fine! So we want to go from Attack back

108
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,700
to Idle, after about 3 cycles. Let's

109
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,700
see how this look! So about 1,000, 2,000,

110
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,700
3,000, then 1,000... Ooh, so he's not doing 3 full

111
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,700
cycles. Let's check the return condition, it didn't remember that. Remember that when you

112
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,700
set your exit time, you must hit Return and not be in Play Mode.

113
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,700
Let's try that again! 1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

114
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,700
1,000, 2,000, 3,000. He's just going back and forth.

115
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Awesome, so finally the Cactus is a Defender, so I'm going to drag it under Defenders.

116
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,700
And we have some structure coming on, we have Attackers, Defenders,

117
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,700
and of course, we're just going to keep repeating this process. Now remember, the

118
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,700
slide that I gave you in the previous video, this one Character Animation

119
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,700
Overview. We create a character parent and child body object. We ensure

120
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,700
that the Animator is on the parent object. We convert the Sprite Sheet into separate

121
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,700
frames, that's been done for you in the Asset Pack. We add a Sprite Renderer

122
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Curve to the body object, and we adjust

123
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,700
animation to taste. So that's what we're going to need to do for everything.

124
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,700
So I want you to animate the rest of the Defenders now. Animate all the other Defenders,

125
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,700
aim for them to cycle every 3 seconds, and if you're stuck, watch me over the

126
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,700
coming videos. So pause the video, have a go at animating the rest of the Defenders now,

127
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
and in the next video, this time, I will start to show you my solution.

128
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,600
