
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So I've

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
got something a little different for you mid-section here. We're going to have a fairly major challenge.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's major in terms of how long it'll take you, rather than how difficult it is, and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that is to get the turret rotating. So, if you want to dive

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
in without any help, then I'll give you the challenge now. And then, for those of you who want a little bit

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
of extra guidance, I'll give that before showing the solution. So, you're

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
going to need to revise the last few lectures, I think if you need to, unless it's already fresh.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
At least take a look at your commits*. You are committing aren't you?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we're going to need you to work through the blueprints and the C++ code to

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
make this turret work and basically see if you can get the turret rotating, but

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
don't worry about how the barrel, that barrel moves. It

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
doesn't matter if it goes from A to B in a slightly strange way, we'll deal

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
with that as a separate entity and modification. But

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
see if you can get it working. Now, if you're really confident and pause the video now, go ahead

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
spend a while on it. It's going to be a fantastic way to completely integrate your knowledge,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
over the last few lectures. If you're not so confident, then bear with me just a second while

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I show you a few pointers. So, just a few reminders

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for those of you who want the help. Remember that we set a Barrel Reference

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
on the Tank, and then, that Tank sends that reference down to the TankAimingComponent.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Remember that we changed the barrel from a StaticMeshComponent,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
like the Turret currently is, into a TankBarrelComponent.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, we're going to need to so something very similar, make a TankTurretComponent and reorganize

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this hierarchy and get all that working, making a BlueprintSpawnableComponent.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now all that sounds scary, but actually, most of this is in here

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
as a template. So, if you start with your TankPlayerController,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
remember that that's where everything starts, you will need very quickly then to move down

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
to the Tank, where you will be making yourself BarrelReference

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
letters like this for the Turret. And then, we will be moving into the

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
custom class called TankTurret.h, and that will

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
be very similar to this, with slightly different wording of course. And

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we won't be wanting max and min rotation, we can let the thing just keep going round

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and round and round. And remember, of course, that all of this is being called from the

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
TankAimingComponent.cpp file, and we are

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
making a (DeltaRotator.Pitch) call. You can probably guess what you need to do,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
in order to do the turret rotation. So,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
there are enough hints for you, I think there. Let's go ahead,

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
go back to the challenge, let you really pause the video, enjoy this larger

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
challenge, take your time, and remember to use source control as your friend, when you

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
get a little bit of something working. Make a micro commit if you need to, just a commit if

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
a small amount occurred, and go for it, it'll really increase your confidence if you can get this done.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And if you can't get it done for any reason, don't worry, I know it's a big challenge. Just watch my solution

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and learn what you can from it. So see you soon!

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
OK welcome back! If I had any sleeves

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'd be rolling them up to get stuck in, but I don't, I'm in a polo shirt, so no sleeves

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
for me. However, I will say this might well take more than one video to get done,

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
because it's a little bit more, a little bit more. OK, so we've got a magic

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
number sitting right in front of my face. Delete that, we just don't need it.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, I think that in order to get started, we're going to need to

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
start by making this new class, right? Because nearly everything's going to depend on it. I can't wire

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
up the blueprint, I can't get my references, I can't do anything without a new class, so let's go

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
ahead and make a new class! Now, if you're not sure what the class should be, well we're modeling the Turret,

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the Barrel rather remember, which was a StaticMeshComponent type.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, we add a new C++ class. Now, there is no StaticMeshComponent

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
in this list, unfortunately, so we have to click Show All Classes.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And we go StaticMeshComponent like that, and then,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,300
let's call it Tank.

57
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,300
OK, so let's create this class! Now, it would be prudent,

58
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,300
once this class is created, to open up the TankBarrel and use it

59
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,300
as a bit of a template for the Turret. Now, when you use another class as a template, you need to be a bit

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,300
careful that you don't end up inheriting behavior that's not relevant,

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,300
but on the other hand, you know we've done a lot of work in the Barrel and why not

62
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,300
use it. So, there's my TankBarrel.h and then the Turret's

63
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,300
to the right of it. By the way, if you want to change the order that these tabs open, say I open

64
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Tank, you see mine opens on the right. If you don't like yours opening on the left, it's

65
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Tools and Options, over here in VisualStudio, and then, you look for Tab

66
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,300
and then you'll find under Environment, Tabs and Windows, this top setting.

67
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,300
There, now Xcode people don't really have the same concept, because Windows works

68
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,300
differently in Xcode. Alright, so what did we do

69
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,300
in the TankBarrel to make it available to the blueprint. It was that line

70
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,300
there. Remember that, over in the Tank blueprint, we're going to want to add a

71
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,300
system component right, and we don't have Tank Turret, even

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,300
though we've made the C++ class. And that is simply because we need this line that

73
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,300
I've got highlighted. Paste it in as our class

74
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,300
annotation like that. Alright, that alone will make it possible to add it to the

75
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,300
blueprint. Let's try it! We need to compile, and then, if we go down to the

76
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Custom component list here, there it is, Tank Aiming and Tank Barrel right now.

77
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,300
Once the code compiles, Tank Turret should appear in that list. Now we may have to

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,300
just repopulate the list, because it's not dynamic. There you go, Tank Turret!

79
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Fantastic! So that was that bit. Now once you've got a Tank Turret, it needs to be

80
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,300
childed to the Tank appropriately. So, just make sure by

81
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,300
expanding and collapsing, whatever you need to do, to make sure it's at the right level, cause that's

82
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,300
really important or the sockets won't work. Cool! Alright, so

83
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,300
while we've still got a Turret to model, what is it about it? What have we changed about the

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Turret? Well not that much, I mean you can't tell by flicking

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,300
through quickly, but that's one of the reasons, actually, I've hidden Collision on our version,

86
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,300
because you see how much simpler and lighter this is. Collision and Physics have gone

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,300
with the Collision. That makes it easier to look at, but

88
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,300
our Turret basically just had a StaticMesh on it. So, let's just go and set

89
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,300
the Turret Mesh like this. Ooh, two r's I think.

90
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Great! It's go no offset, that's cool! So, we've got a Tank Turret now!

91
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,300
We can move our Barrel into this new TankTurret, and I think I can

92
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,300
safely say, let's ditch the old Turret. Let's go to the Viewport, it makes life a bit easier to see what's going on.

93
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,300
There goes the old Turret. If you highlight it and delete it, the new one can

94
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,300
just be called Turret, and then, we've got a bit of messing around

95
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,300
to do. Why is the Turret on the floor? Well, because it hasn't been parented

96
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,300
to the Tank's Turret socket. Boom! Why is the

97
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Barrel up in the air? Because the Barrel has been reparented to this Turret and therefore, it's lost its

98
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,300
parent socket connection. Boom! Why is the Barrel still floating in

99
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,300
the air? Because it has an arbitrary location. It wants to have a location of 0,

100
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,300
so does the Turret. Fantastic, there you go! We have

101
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,300
a Turret, looks exactly the same, but of course, this blueprint

102
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,300
is completely different, because it's based on the TankTurret class, rather than a

103
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,300
StaticMesh. Let's go ahead and compile! I'm also going to Save All.

104
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,300
You'll notice that the little stars up here will disappear, when I do that; it's important in case anything crashes,

105
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,300
not to lose my work. Alright, how are we doing in this video? We're

106
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,300
about 7 and a bit minutes in, and I think we can keep going. So, let's go

107
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,300
and think about getting these setter references next, I think while we're still in

108
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,300
blueprint. So, in your Tank blueprint, in the Event Graph,

109
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,300
we're going to need a set Turret Reference Method.

110
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,300
So, let's go and make that happen on the Tank

111
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Barrel.cpp file. Ooh, why am I looking there?! Well, I'll leave that open, I

112
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,300
need it, but it's actually on the Tank.cpp file.

113
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,300
We had ourselves a, let's put the Tank on the left

114
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,300
because the execution flow goes left to right.

115
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,300
So, there is the SetBarrelReference, of course, we're just going to want to make a Set

116
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,300
TurretReference. So, it's simply copying that method. We can do a

117
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Find and Replace. There's a quick replace, Control H. Look for Barrel

118
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,300
and replace with Turret, in the Selection not the whole thing.

119
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Alright, let's Replace All. That looks pretty cool! Alright,

120
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,300
now we're going to need the Tank header file, so I'm going to pop that on the left, in this case, after having

121
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,300
changed my preference, and we're going to have a very similar thing. It's going to need

122
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,300
to be blueprint callable, so that over in the blueprint

123
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,300
here we can actually well call it, simply enough. And instead

124
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,300
of having a TurretBarrelReference, we have a TurretReference. I've already got that same

125
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Find and Replace. So, Control H makes it very easy to just do a quick

126
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,300
switch. And that should be it for the Tank, apart

127
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,300
from, we need to remember, that it delegates this down to the Tank

128
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,300
AimingComponent, and that doesn't currently have a SetTurretReference.

129
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,300
So, let's mosey on over to the TankAimingComponent header file

130
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,300
and implementation file, as it happens. I'm going to

131
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,300
organize these into the order of the call stack, and then, we have this SetBarrelReference

132
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
that can be duplicated into a SetTurretReference, getting rid of the TODO,

133
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,300
because well we're TODO-ing it. [Laughs] OK, let's Control

134
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,300
H it, do a Replace. That's cool! So useful having that

135
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,300
replacement ready to go like that, and then, the same in the implementation.

136
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Pretty simple, we copy and paste, and

137
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,300
then, we do a Control H. Now, remember the rule with programming. If you're

138
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,300
doing something twice it's fine, if it starts thinking about doing it a third time, well

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,300
then maybe we need to be thinking about something more generic here, but this is fine for just

140
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,300
a Barrel and a Turret. We know that this pain of copying and pasting is going to end, because

141
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,300
we only have those two things and everything else in the Tank is somewhat different.

142
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,300
But be on the look out for doing things a third time, see if you could do them

143
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,300
another way. Alright, we've done enough code manipulation there. We've just cut and pasted

144
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,300
methods using what we do in the Barrel as an inspiration for what we're doing

145
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,300
in the Turret. So, let's just make sure this compiles now. Then, I think we'll set the reference

146
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,300
and call it a day for this video, get the rest of it done in another.

147
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,300
So my compile failed, pretty inevitable with a load of code like that.

148
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,300
I've probably just done a silly boo boo, where I have not changed the class name.

149
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,300
So, in the TankAimingComponent line 22, what are we

150
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,300
doing? Ah, OK it's a lack of forward declaration, that's all it

151
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,300
is. It doesn't understand what TankTurret is, so we come along and say class

152
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,300
UTankTurret. And we should also, while we're here, say, well does the Tank

153
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,300
AimingComponent.cpp need a TankTurret? Well of course it does!

154
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Thats what I forgot but that's a good reminder about how these forward declarations would work.

155
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,300
OK, I'm going to assume, for a moment, that's the only

156
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,300
error, because compilation is fast here. When I say the only error it clearly

157
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,300
isn't the only error, a lot of these say error error error. By the way, they may say warning sometimes,

158
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,300
which isn't fatal but they're all errors, but I suspect that they're all a cascade

159
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,300
of what was going wrong there. Alright, so there's one more thing

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,300
on line 27, and then, we have Turret = TurretToSet.

161
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,300
It doesn't have a local member variable called Turret and that's simply because we didn't make one.

162
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,300
So, we're just going to copy that line, pop it in,

163
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,300
do a Find and Replace with Control H, look for Barrel

164
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,300
in the Selection. We'll probably have to reselect and relook

165
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,300
for the Barrel, and then, just do a Replace. Replace

166
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,300
or Replace All. OK, that should do it, let's see if it does!

167
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Back over to the compilation. You can see how kind of wrote this is and

168
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,300
simple. As I say, remember the rule of three, twice copying fine, three times

169
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,300
probably worth putting a more robust structure in, but that would be much more complicated than we

170
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,300
need here. OK fantastic, so that's worked! So, I can stay over here, go to the Tank blueprint,

171
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,300
and I'm going to set the reference for the Turret, straight after the Barrel. So,

172
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,300
I'm going to go over here. SetTurretReference, perfect! That method has come

173
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,300
up. I'm going to go get the Turret, which is of the new type, the Tank Turret type,

174
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,300
pop it in there, and then, I think what would be prudent to do

175
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,300
now is just compile the blueprint. I'm going to save everything, in case we end

176
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,300
up with some null pointer error. We shouldn't, there's no pointers to protect yet, because we're just

177
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,300
setting them in the C++ code. It's very simple, we're just setting

178
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,300
something to a reference. But it is possible that if we don't

179
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,300
tie that up... In fact, we should probably protect it, you know, this BarrelToSet

180
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,300
coming in here. How about if that BarrelToSet doesn't come in? So, we could just simply

181
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,300
go, if not (BarrelToSet)

182
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,300
;

183
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,300
Return what? Well nothing, because it's a void method. So, we should do the same thing with the

184
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Turret, using our same trick of Control H

185
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
and replacing, and that just protects the pointer. If you think,

186
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300
oh well it could crash because of a null pointer, don't just sit there on that potential problem, let's deal with it.

187
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,300
OK, let's compile up, that'll be a good sign that all of our C++ code

188
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,300
works! Then, we'll play the game which will make us sure that all of the blueprints

189
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,300
still compile, and that is enough for one video. So let's play the game!

190
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,300
And that's working, I'm pretty happy, I'm going to Save All, and make

191
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,166
a commit. So, I shall see you in the next video!
