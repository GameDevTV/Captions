00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. welcome to Code Architecture Storing State! In this video

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we're going to reorganize a little bit. so that we have a slightly different

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
method over on our TankBarrle.h. We're going to call it MoveToPitch.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
rather than elevate at a particular speed. And by the

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
end of it. we'll be in a similar position but with better architecture. and we will

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
have a log here saying exactly what target pitch the barrel needs

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.033
to be going to. So. see you in the next video!

8
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:31.033
So. before we go any further. let's make sure we understand how all this works. And we're going to make a

9
00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:35.033
small change to a method inside the barrel. So. this is how things

10
00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.033
happen. The TankPlayerController or Tank AI Controller here call an

11
00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:43.033
AimAt method. with a world space Hit Location on the Tank. So. you're just saying

12
00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:47.033
to the Tank. hey aim over here buddy. The Tank then looks at its own

13
00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:51.033
LaunchSpeed. which is a property of the tank. It doesn't need to be known by the Player or the AI

14
00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:55.033
really. because we aim at a particular world

15
00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:59.033
point. and it's up to the Tank to know its current launch speed. That may even vary if we

16
00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.033
upgraded the Tank. So it just takes that LaunchSpeed and passes

17
00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:07.033
it along with the HitLocation to the TankAimingComponent. So. it's

18
00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.033
nearly delegation but it's not quite. because we're actually adding some value here. we're adding the

19
00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:15.033
LaunchSpeed. The TankAimingComponent. I'm going to suggest. then uses a

20
00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.033
move to a particular pitch method. rather than the

21
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:23.033
current thing that we started to build. which is Elevate at a particular

22
00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:27.033
speed. And the reason is that we don't need to be telling the Barrel how

23
00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:31.033
fast to Elevate. The Player and the AI both

24
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:35.033
want the Barrel to move up and down as fast as possible and left and right. they just want it

25
00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:39.033
to go to the aiming point. So rather than calculating a speed

26
00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:43.033
to move at and then having to worry about clamping that speed and

27
00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:47.033
making sure that its a reasonable speed. t's not really up to the AimingComponent how

28
00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:51.033
fast the Barrel moves. it's up to the Barrel how fast the Barrel moves. So we're going to say to the Barrel in the future.

29
00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:55.033
just move to a particular pitch. a particular number of degrees

30
00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:59.033
above or below the horizon. Alright. so there's a bit of an architectural

31
00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:03.033
change we're going to make there. And this architecture is nice and simple and it means

32
00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:07.033
that we're only storing state. either at the PlayerController or down in the Barrel.

33
00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:11.033
So the rotation. or the Pitch of the Barrel should I say. is

34
00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:15.033
only stored in the Barrel mesh and then when you tell it to move to a pitch.

35
00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:19.033
the job of the Barrel is to start moving towards that target pitch.

36
00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:23.033
and the Barrel's pitch is not stored in the TankAimingComponent or in the Tank

37
00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:27.033
or in the Player Controller. The desired aim direction is

38
00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:31.033
up at the Player Controller. and the actual current aim direction is right down

39
00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:35.033
in the Barrel. So we're keeping our state at the top and the bottom of the stack.

40
00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:39.033
which is generally more healthy than trying to consider what's going on in between.

41
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:43.033
OK. so let's just challenge you now to make that minor

42
00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:47.033
change. By the way. the Barrel also has a concept of the Max and

43
00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:51.033
MinDegreesPerSecond. A Max and Min Elevation rather and the

44
00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:55.033
MaxDegreesPerSecond. So you say to the Barrel. hey. Barrel. go move to a particular pitch.

45
00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:59.033
You decide how fast to move there. You decide

46
00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:03.033
how high you can go and how low you can go and hence whether you can even get there. The Tank

47
00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:07.033
AimingComponent's just going to instruct it to try and get to that pitch as quickly as possible.

48
00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:11.033
Alright. so given that. let's just make that minor

49
00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:15.033
API change. and I'm going to let you do that. re-architect  your code. Apply that simple new architecture.

50
00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:19.033
You're just renaming a method there on the Barrel. And

51
00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:23.033
no need to actually implement anything new at this stage. just go ahead and make the

52
00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:27.033
basic renaming. and make sure that you are completely comfortable with the architecture

53
00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:31.033
and how the calling occurs. So go ahead. pause the video. take a good look at the code. make sure it

54
00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:35.033
makes sense to you and do that now.

55
00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:39.033
So welcome back! Alright. so it's literally

56
00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:43.033
pretty simple. we just want to Elevate to... Well. I said I was going to rename the

57
00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:47.033
method didn't I? So. let's rename it! Rather than Elevate. let's just say MoveTo.

58
00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:51.033
and it's a good idea to change names if you change the function. so you don't confuse yourself.

59
00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:55.033
It's a clean break. if you like. changing that name. So MoveTo

60
00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:59.033
(float... And what did I say it was going to be called? ...Pitch).

61
00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:03.033
OK. so we're going to move

62
00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:07.033
to a particular Pitch. That's fine! So.

63
00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:11.033
now we need to change this log.

64
00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:15.033
("Moving towards pitch: and then we're going to

65
00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:19.033
take in the Pitch. rather than degrees per second. Now let's go look and see

66
00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:23.033
where this is called from. Well it's called from the TankAimingComponent.

67
00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:27.033
And rather than Barrel->Elevate

68
00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:31.033
(5). what we're going to do is we're going to Barrel...

69
00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:35.033
I'll tell you what I better do. I'd better edit the header file.

70
00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:39.033
Let's go get the signature from here.

71
00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:43.033
pop it in the header file without the class

72
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:47.033
name. MoveTo Pitch. OK fantastic! Now. in the Aiming

73
00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:51.033
Component. we're going to Barrle->Move

74
00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:55.033
To(). Now we're going to pass at a pitch. Now. what is that pitch? Well.

75
00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:59.033
we no longer need to the DeltaRotator do we? We just need to know

76
00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:03.033
what we want to be aiming towards. In fact. we don't even care

77
00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:07.033
what the Barrel's current rotation

78
00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:11.033
is. In fact. we don't even need to the MoveBarrelTowards method. because we

79
00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:15.033
can just. straight in here. just say Barrel->

80
00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:19.033
MoveTo(). So it's (AimDirection dot. Now what

81
00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:23.033
is the AimDirection? Well. it's an FVector. so we need to

82
00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:27.033
turn that into a rotation. OK

83
00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:31.033
fantastic! And then we ask for its Pitch.

84
00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:35.033
Your remembering

85
00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:39.033
that Rotation is a method like that. Fantastic! So what we're going

86
00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:43.033
to do is. we're going to tell the Barrel to move to a particular pitch. We don't

87
00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:47.033
need the MoveBarrelTowards method. that's a great simplification. So. let's take that out of the TankAiming

88
00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:51.033
Component's header file. Well done if you've spotted this bit. by the way.

89
00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:55.033
So that's very simple and hopefully

90
00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:59.033
that's all we need to do. And then. by the way. I'm also going to

91
00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:03.033
make sure that none of my header files have any

92
00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:07.033
#includes of other unnecessary header files. per the forward declarations

93
00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:11.033
and compiler video we talked about. So the tank includes

94
00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:15.033
the TankAimingComponent. Well. why does it include the TankAimingComponent? It

95
00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:19.033
doesn't need to. The Tank.cpp will need to. but the Tank.h

96
00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:23.033
doesn't need to. So. let's take the TankAimingComponent out of the Tank.h. into the Tank.cpp.

97
00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:27.033
and then. back at the Tank.h

98
00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:31.033
so that TankAimingComponent here is available. We're

99
00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:35.033
also going to write class TankAimingComponent; with

100
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:39.033
a U. so that's your forward declaration. So. I'm just going through and popping forward declarations

101
00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:43.033
in everywhere that we need them. The AIController. that's including the Tank. it shouldn't be.

102
00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:47.033
Let's cut that out. put it in the Tank.cpp.

103
00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:51.033
which it already is. and then. back at the

104
00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:55.033
TankAIController let's. if we need it. do a

105
00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:59.033
forward declaration of the Tank. which we do

106
00:06:59.033 --> 00:07:03.033
because we use ATank here. So. let's just go class ATank;

107
00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:07.033
That's great! And just tighten this up a little bit. Let's

108
00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:11.033
move to the next header file. The TankAimingComponent. that doesn't include anything unnecessary.

109
00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:15.033
The TankBarrel doesn't include anything unnecessary. and the TankPlayerController

110
00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:19.033
does. it includes the Tank. Naughty naughty! Let's take it out of the PlayerController.h.

111
00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:23.033
into the PlayerController.cpp

112
00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:27.033
and in the Player.Controller.h. because we need access to a tank.

113
00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:31.033
Do we need access to a a tank anywhere? Maybe we don't? Yes we do. ATank*

114
00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:35.033
star. so therefore we're going to need to go class ATank.

115
00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:39.033
Cool! Alright. so we sorted a couple of things out there in one go! Let's make sure this compiles.

116
00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:43.033
It was just a relatively simple API change there.

117
00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:47.033
To make sure that aiming is simpler and that we've

118
00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:51.033
removed code. Removing code is always a good thing. I'll be surprised if I don't get at least one

119
00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:55.033
compilation error in all of those changes. because well I made a lot of changes.

120
00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:59.033
There it is. "use of undefined type 'ATank' " in TankAIController.

121
00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:03.033
line 18. So. and that's because I

122
00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:07.033
do need to #include the tank in the TankAIController.

123
00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:11.033
I just forgot to do that.

124
00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:15.033
OK. let's just try compiling again.

125
00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:19.033
Now. if you had a bigger project. it'd probably be quicker to read through

126
00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:23.033
all the error messages and make sure you had got to all of them

127
00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:27.033
that weren't cascades. But it's difficult to know when one error's

128
00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:31.033
caused by a whole bunch of others. without reading really carefully. so in our case. it's quicker just to recompile.

129
00:08:31.033 --> 00:08:35.033
So if we play now. look you can see that it's aiming towards pitch. and if I go down here. -30

130
00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:39.033
degree. -3 degrees... Let me just switch

131
00:08:39.033 --> 00:08:43.033
back to VisualStudio because it's popped over the top. If I aim at

132
00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:47.033
that hill. it may be the most obstructive. it's probably going at the high arc there at 80 degrees. that

133
00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:51.033
tank 8 degrees. It looks feasible! So. much better looking architecture

134
00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:55.033
for us there. so I hope that all makes sense to you. I'm going to pop up on the screen

135
00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:59.033
that. How The Barrel Elevates. the new API.

136
00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:03.033
Remember that we also went through... I went through it pretty quickly. so I went through

137
00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:07.033
and switched out all the forward declarations. well all of the #includes

138
00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:11.033
of unnecessary header files in header files and moved to forward declarations.

139
00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:15.033
So. make sure you've done that and that makes sense. Gather yourself

140
00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:18.299
mentally and I'll see you in the next video!
