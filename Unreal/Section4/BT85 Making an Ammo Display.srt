00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So welcome to Making

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
an Ammo Display! In this video we'll be doing exactly that. and by the end of it we'll have a little

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
ammo display up there. number 3. and when we cannot fire anymore. our crosshair

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.600
or reticle will go gray. So I'll see you in there!

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.600
Hello and welcome back! So let's just take a look at what we're going to

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.600
be doing. We want a ammo display. but just before we start. notice that

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.600
neither of those AI tanks are currently aiming at me. Yet as I drive a little bit

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.600
closer. the guy on the left starts aiming. then hopefully the

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.600
guy on the right starts aiming. There we go! So what could that be? What's the most likely

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.600
reason they're not aiming at me. at this stage. Well. if you think about it. I seem to be

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.600
just outside a radius don't I. one starts aiming and then the other. Well the

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.600
problem. of course. is that the velocity that they can

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.600
fire at is not high enough. I'm going to increase the Launch Speed to 8.000

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.600
or 80 meters a second or nearly 200 miles an hour.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600
over on the TankAimingComponent in the tank blueprint. Now. when we

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.600
start the game. we should find they both aim at us. because they both have an aiming solution. and we

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.600
are basically in range. Perfect! Alright. so we want a

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.600
piece of display text. Why don't we make the display text first. create the pane.

19
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.600
hey just for fun! So what I mean by that is. create a problem to

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.600
solve. The problem will be. we have no way of updating the display text. but at least we'll have the display

21
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.600
text. So let's grab the text. drop it onto our UI.

22
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.600
make it a little bit bigger. I'm going to use

23
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.600
a 96 font. That's a bit leery. let's try 72.

24
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.600
OK that's fine! There's no border around it. so it doesn't really matter how

25
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.600
I aligned the text in there. at this stage at least. but I think centered

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.600
may be better. Now I'm just going to put a default number in of

27
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.600
3 or even XX like that. just so I can help

28
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.600
see what's going on in terms of alignment. and then. what I want to do

29
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.600
is think very quickly. with any new item. about what the anchor point is.

30
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.600
And in the case of this piece of text. we want it anchored to

31
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.600
probably the top-right of the screen would make sense.

32
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.600
So let's compile and just have a look at that. If we play. then it's a fixed distance from the top-

33
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.600
right of this viewport. but remember that we are currently playing

34
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.600
in the selected viewport. You see when you say

35
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.600
Play Mode. Selected Viewport. so if we play now it's still anchored to the top-right.

36
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.600
So that's cool! If you want to see what it would be like. in a stand alone instance.

37
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.600
you can go to the drop-down up here. near the play button. and say Standalone

38
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.600
Game. If you do that. it'll ask you to save everything. no harm in that.

39
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.600
and it'll open a whole new process and play the game in a nice 16 x 9

40
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.600
window or however we've got our game configured. and then. it'll show you that the ammo

41
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.600
display works there. too. Cool! So the ammo display is anchored to the top-right.

42
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.600
Now what we're going to need is a getter. So under the Content section of the

43
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.600
text-box. that we've put in. we want to go ahead and create a

44
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.600
binding from that and we get some blueprint. Alright

45
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.600
cool! So look. I've done enough. I want you to do that rest of this. So I'm going to give you

46
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.600
a challenge. Make an ammo display. Get an ammo

47
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.600
display working. Basically. we want it counting down. it should count down each time you fire.

48
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.600
As a bonus. make the crosshair go gray. when you're completely out of ammo.

49
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.600
and a tip for you. if you do add a new enum state. for example. out of ammo.

50
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.600
you're going to need to restart the Editor in the current version of Unreal. in order for that

51
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.600
enum state to show in your blueprint because of a bug. OK

52
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.600
pause the video. see if you can get ammo display working in it's entirety now.

53
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.600


54
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.600
Hey hey hey. welcome back! So in order for this to work. we're going to need to go

55
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.600
ahead and open a couple of files. of course. and it's mainly going to

56
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.600
be the TankAimingComponent. And let's look at the TankAiming

57
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600
Component header file. So I'm going to make myself and OutOfAmmo

58
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.600
enum state. while I'm there. because well we

59
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.600
want to keep track of that. I'm also. at the bottom of the TankAimingComponent.h.

60
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.600
going to make an integer RoundsLeft. and I'm going to make a

61
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.600
default of 3. So we start with 3 rounds. unless

62
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.600
we're told anything else. Now. we're going to need a getter. so don't make it

63
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.600
public. Make yourself an integer Get

64
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.600
RoundsLeft(). It doesn't need any parameters.

65
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.600
const method like that. so that any class can

66
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.600
ask the AimingComponent how many rounds it's got left. That seems perfectly reasonable to me.

67
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.600
I'm going to create a definition. using Visual

68
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.600
Studio's tool. "A definition for the symbol 'GetRoundLeft' "...

69
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.600
It's not going to work. so I'll just go do it myself. Not a problem. I'll put it under

70
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.600
Tick. I think. So it's going to be

71
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.600
int. the class name.

72
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.600
::GetRoundsLeft() const to match

73
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.600
the signature. and then. we're just going to return

74
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.600
RoundsLeft. comsa! Very simple! OK

75
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.600
let's just compile this! We want to stay close to compilation. i.e.

76
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.600
close to a game that is ready to compile. and then. we have ourselves a

77
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.600
RoundsLeft variable. But we're going to need to expose this guy to

78
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.600
blueprint aren't we. otherwise we're not going to be able to read it. Here in the PlayerUI.

79
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.600
where I went over to the Designer and

80
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.600
bound this. created a binding. what happened is in the graph here it

81
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.600
created a whole new Event Graph called Get Text 0. Well let's give that a more meaningful

82
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.600
name. over on the My Blueprint tab. Let's rename it to

83
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Get_Rounds_Left or something like that.

84
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.600
so it's a bit more meaningful. And what we're going to want here is. we're going to want to be able to get the

85
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.600
BP_Aiming Component Reference. and from this. we're going to want to be able to Get Rounds

86
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.600
Left. We can't right now. Why not? Well because this is not a UPROPERTY.

87
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.600
And in fact. it's going to be the same UPROPERTY as Fire().

88
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.600
so I'll just use that one there. It's going to be a BlueprintCallable. Firing category.

89
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.600
GetRoundsLeft() OK. So that's cool! Let's go

90
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.600
ahead and compile our code. and then. we will have here.

91
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.600
in the graph. specifically the GetRoundsLeft

92
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.600
Event Graph of the PlayerUI blueprint. we will have the ability to

93
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.600
call GetRoundsLeft. on the PlayerUI blueprint

94
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.600
reference that we have. Once we get that. we need to take the

95
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.600
value. and what do we do with it? We're going to turn it into a string.

96
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.600
Once it's a string. you'll notice that this is a one color and this text

97
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.600
here is slightly differently. They've made them a similar color. which is cool. but they're not exactly

98
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.600
the same. One is an internationalizer or. as they call it. a localizable

99
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.600
text and this is a string. but it turns out. if you drag the two together. it'll

100
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.600
put the required string to localizable

101
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.600
text node in for you. So that's pretty cool! So there's your blueprint.

102
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.600
like that! You can line these up all day. and there are various tools to distribute

103
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.600
and line these things up. if you care about that. Alignment. Align

104
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.600
Center. middle like that or whatever. however you like it. but

105
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.600
the point is that's the logic. So that is now getting the

106
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.600
rounds left. Let's see if it is! Let's play the game! Not in Stand Alone. I'm going to go back to the Viewport.

107
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.600
just because I can see it. There you go. XX! Now. it's

108
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.600
not working. Why not? GetRoundLeft. let's compile

109
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.600
it. It's because it's not compiling! So it's saying that we have a

110
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600
"Invalid option value 'Reloading' in Select". and we have

111
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.600
an error here. OK this error probably is because we have changed

112
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.600
or I changed the enum. and this enum is not up to date with the

113
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.600
enum that I changed. So let me try just deleting this guy.

114
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.600
there that's probably my best bet and coming off and going Select.

115
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.600
No I've still not go the fourth enum state. so this is the bug I was telling you about.

116
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.600
Let's close Unreal altogether.

117
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.600
Now something's linked to... I just want to make sure I'm not going to lose anything.

118
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.600
It's the PlayerUI Blueprint. That's OK. we don't mind losing a bit of that. because that's what we're working

119
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.600
on anyway. So I'm not going to save the PlayerUI Blueprint.

120
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.600
This is a bug in Unreal. it's known about. at the moment. and I did say you need to

121
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.600
restart the Editor. if you are going to be able to get that new enum state. So

122
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.600
back into the PlayerUI Blueprint! Let's see what we lost. in terms of the Graph.

123
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.600
All of it! [Laughs] OK. but at least

124
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.600
here. in this section we still now have

125
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.600
a four element enum. OK. so sorry

126
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.600
about the bug on Unreal's behalf. but that's what it is. you do need to restart to fix it. So I'm

127
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.600
going to get rid of that comment. Now notice. on Out Of Ammo. we can actually

128
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.600
directly set the color. so I'm going to set it to gray. Now I wonder if that would.

129
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.600
if it were a bit darker. I wonder if that would work on the others. Well I think it would. If we break this

130
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.600
link. then you'll see that locked is defaulting to black. I can go to the previous

131
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.600
green. select the hex color. put it in here.

132
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.600
And why am I doing this? Just because it's simpler. we're reducing the number of nodes. Break the Link.

133
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.600
get the hex color.

134
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.600
do that. final one.

135
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.600
get the hex color. and

136
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.600
off we go! Now I do want to thank the student that mentioned this. on the forum.

137
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.600
By the way. we can get rid of these nodes. I don't remember the students name. but we can always go and have a look!

138
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.600
No harm in seeing our community forums. so you can do

139
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.600
searches in here. I think it's "cleaner". I think that was a word that I remember in it.

140
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.600
Cleaner Color Selection Node. and yeah. Jonas_J! Thank you very much for showing that that's

141
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.600
possible. It shows that if you do contribute in the forum that I do listen and

142
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.600
build it into later videos. So there you go! We now have the colors

143
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.600
directly in there. much neater. much tidier. much happier Ben. hopefully

144
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.600
much happier students and that's that! Now. of course. it lost

145
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.600
all of our other stuff that we did. didn't it? So if we go to the Designer.

146
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.600
it lost all of this binding information. so let's just do that again. We recreate

147
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.600
the binding. we go get our Aiming Component Reference.

148
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.600
we drag off it. we go and Get the Rounds

149
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.600
Left. like so.

150
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.600
we turn it To a String. and sometimes you just have to

151
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.600
redo your work with a smile and not worry about it. Try not to swear. try not to

152
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.600
curse. try not to get into any sort of victim mentality about it. it happens to all of us. If you want to

153
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.600
use a powerful tool like this. that's cutting edge and constantly changing. we'll have some problems with it

154
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.600
sometimes. just deal with it. try not to get stressed. Just smile and carry

155
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.600
on. if you get stressed and angry about it. it's only you that it's going to effect at the end of the day.

156
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.600
You might want to report a bug. you might want to do something proactive. but

157
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.600
please don't fill yourself up with stress. Alright. so that's done! I've recreated

158
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.600
that. I've saved everything. Let's go back and see if it works! Three! Now I'm going to fire!

159
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.600
Three. OK good! So this is exactly what I

160
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.600
expect. is that it doesn't count down yet. Why not? Because when we fire.

161
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.600
in the TankAimingComponent. we need to say RoundsLeft

162
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.600
-- which is a shortcut for RoundsLeft. = RoundsLeft - 1.

163
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.600
Let's just check that that change worked. but I'm pretty confident it will do.

164
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.600
And while that compiles. as a check. let's think about when

165
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.600
we want to fire. Do we only want to be able to fire when reloading? Well let's look at the states.

166
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.600
Here they are! No we want to be able to fire

167
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.600
when we are aiming or locked. What we were saying is.

168
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.600
fire when we're not reloading. but now that means. fire when we're

169
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.600
Aiming. Locked. or OutOfAmmo. and we don't want to be able to fire when we're OutOfAmmo. we only want Aiming

170
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.600
and Locked. So I'm going to change the logic around completely. Did this compile? Yes!

171
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.600
I'm going to change the logic around completely to fire if the EFiringState

172
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.600
is Locked. for the AI Tanks. or

173
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.600
the EFiringState

174
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.600
is Aiming. so that we can fire

175
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.600
if we want to. before we get Locked. Does that make sense? So we can now

176
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.600
fire in Locked or Aiming. very explicit. it's positive rather than negative.

177
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.600
I prefer that. I'm just going to back indent there. So let's have a look!

178
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.600
We should now only be able to fire at the right time. basically.

179
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.600
Apart from. we never set the

180
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.600
OutOfAmmo state. did we?

181
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.600
We have this OutOfAmmo state. it never gets set. but when we'll be setting states. we're setting them

182
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.600
here. in the TickComponent. So it's all very well that we decrement.

183
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.600
right now. Three. two.

184
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.600
etc.. but we're going to go below 0 if we're not careful. So what we want to do is put another if

185
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600
statement at the top. Now be careful. if you're putting another if at the top of an if. remember to put your

186
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.600
else first. Now we can come in and put the new condition.

187
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.600
if (RoundsLeft is less than or equal to 0... Why

188
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.600
less than or equal to? Just in case we ever ended up in negative rounds. how would we handle

189
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.600
the case of being negative rounds? Well we would still. if we had negative rounds.

190
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.600
be in FiringState of OutOfAmmo. for sure

191
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.600
right. You could just say equals and put an ensure statement up here.

192
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.600
to make sure you never to negative. but it's not that consequential if we go negative at the

193
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.600
moment. so this will do. OK cool! So every Tick.

194
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.600
we're setting OutOfAmmo. If we're not out of ammo. then we're Reloading. if we

195
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.600
have. you know. if it's been too little time since we last fire. If

196
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.600
we're not reloading and the barrel's moving. then we're Aiming. otherwise we're Locked.

197
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.600
So that's the logic of it. Let's see if this works! It should work

198
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.600
for both of us. is what I'm hoping now. because the architecture we have means

199
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.600
us and the AI tanks all have to follow the same rules. So if I Alt P

200
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.600
to play. when I'm here. in a nice full screen and I'm going to fire as I go down the hill.

201
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.600
I have two rounds. I have a red reticle. goes amber. I can

202
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.600
fire again. I have one round. it goes amber. I fire again. it

203
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.600
goes gray. I cannot fire anymore. That's good! Now let's

204
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.600
just check that the AI tanks also fun out of ammo and don't cause any problems.

205
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.600
and I think that they've both had all their rounds. Ah. so

206
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.600
I'm feeling very safe now. apart from I've flipped. I really need to

207
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.600
sort that issue out. I think that's a self collision issue. by the way. and we'll fix it shortly.

208
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.600
OK it seems to be working. it seems to be working absolutely fine! Maybe we have an

209
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.600
ensure that's gone off though. I did see... Yeah. we had a Projectile

210
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.600
Blueprint ensure fire off. I'm not sure why. in this case.

211
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.600
I don't see any reason why we would have had something

212
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.600
not be able to find a projectile. Let's just check the TankAiming

213
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.600
Component has it's projectile bluepri?nt. OK I'm going to put that down to a 1 off. but I'm going to keep an

214
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.600
eye on that. if that happens again. I don't see any fundamental reason

215
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.600
why that should have happened. OK fantastic. we now have much better aiming.

216
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.600
so I will see you in the next video!

217
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:23.766
