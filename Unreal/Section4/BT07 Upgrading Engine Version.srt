
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, it had

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to happen eventually, it's time to upgrade our engine version, this time, mid-section! We're

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
going to go to version 4.11. Now, in the online slides you'll see 4.7 on all

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the slides, because I've changed the template, but of course, it's only version 4.11 I was using

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
from here but the differences are minor. We haven't done anything in this section yet that

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
makes any difference. So, in this video, Epic Games Launcher helps

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you manage versions of the engine. It's pretty good at that, so we'll briefly see that!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Before you do anything, for you to remember to commit your project or take a

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
backup of your project first. Then, you can do a convert in place, which means that we

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
don't create a copy of the project, because you've got a backup, that is your copy.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then, we're going to check our project runs OK in the new version, and then, close everything and

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,533
recommit. I'll also show you how to tag a commit in Github, so let's dive in and do it!

13
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:53,533
Unreal 4.11 has dropped, and one of the features amongst

14
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:57,533
many... By the way, if you want to know what's in there it's in your slides, but you could also just

15
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:01,533
go Unreal 4.11 and look for

16
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:05,533
this here, Unreal blog Unreal Engine 4.11 Released! There's

17
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:09,533
lots and lots of improvement. Most of them are runtime improvements, but it also has some improvements

18
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:13,533
relating to the speed of lighting builds, and as we're doing quite a lot of lighting builds,

19
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:17,533
inside the landscape creation, let's go ahead and upgrade

20
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:21,533
to 4.11. So, you come into your Epic Games... Oops, into your Epic

21
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:25,533
Games Launcher. You'll probably see a little 1 here. And if you don't already have

22
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:29,533
4.11 here then you click Add Versions, and the thing that comes up will allow you to choose

23
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:33,533
4.11. I already have it, so I can just go ahead and install. I'm going to go

24
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:37,533
with the Starter Content and the templates and Feature Packs, in my case,

25
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:41,533
because I want all the latest stuff. So, once you click

26
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:45,533
install, you're going to have to wait for it to download. If you're wondering what the progress is, you can read it here,

27
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:49,533
but you can also see that little black bar filling up. So, let's just let that finish and install

28
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:52,733
now, before we move over and upgrade our project.

29
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:56,733
OK, so now that download is done! Let's go ahead and click Launch!

30
00:01:56,733 --> 00:02:00,733
It's going to open version 4.11. It may take a little while longer than usual,

31
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:04,733
and it's going to ask you which project you want to open. Now, before we go any further, go to

32
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,733
Source Control and make sure you have a commit

33
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:12,733
for your project, because we're going to want to make sure that if it

34
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,733
breaks anything that we can go backwards. Now, Unreal manages that for you. You can,

35
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:20,733
when you say Open, just say Open a Copy, which will make a copy of the game.

36
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:24,733
We've already got a copy, we've got a previous commit right, so I'm going to look for the thing

37
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,733
that says Upgrade in Place. So, let's try under More Options.

38
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:32,733
Here you go, Convert in-place! So, I'm going to use Convert in-place, which means it's actually

39
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:36,733
going to change my project file, and over in the Source Control,

40
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:40,733
we'll start to see those changes come through. There you go, it's started to detect them! Let's watch it, just for

41
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:44,733
the fun! So, the uproject itself, it's made a small change inside that text

42
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,733
file there, saying that the engine association is now 4.11. It's quite

43
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:52,733
cool! We can see the exact things that it's actually going through and changing. Now, what's it doing?

44
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:56,733
Let's take a look. Too busy to tell us right now. [Laughs] There you

45
00:02:56,733 --> 00:03:00,733
go! It's compiling some C++ source code. OK, what else has changed?

46
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:04,733
We'll probably know once the actual game opens. So, here we are,

47
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:08,733
our battle ground in 4.11! Let's just have a look around, just make sure everything is superficially

48
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:12,733
works OK. It does seem to, that's good news!

49
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,733
Alright, let's take a look at Source Control, and it looks like, actually, the only thing that changed

50
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:20,733
was the engine association. Nothing else appears to have changed. I would be slightly

51
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,733
more comfortable, if I actually opened my source code and recompiled that or

52
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:28,733
just simply click Compile inside Unreal. And let's see if...

53
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:32,733
Yep, that seems to have compiled. There is no source code that we've written, of course. So that's it,

54
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:36,733
super simple! Let's crack on with the landscaping now!

55
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,733
So, here we are! What we need to do is to create ourselves a

56
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:44,733
special type of material first, in order to be able to produce

57
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:48,733
the landscape paint. Now, I'm going to just

58
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:52,733
do this for you, and then, I'll put you into a challenge where you can go ahead and do it. You can follow

59
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,733
me through if you wish, but again, I'm going to give you the opportunity to do it all for yourself, inside the

60
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:00,733
challenge. Now, something slightly strange has happened with all my panes here, in Unreal

61
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,733
4.11. I'm just going to kind of regroup things, so that

62
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:08,733
they are a bit more manageable on such a small, low screen

63
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:15,233
resolution. So, the Content Browser, I'm going to put it all up here. There you go! I've got my, kind of, basic screen layout back!

64
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:19,233
OK, so once you're convinced you're back where you were and everything is right with

65
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:23,233
the world, just close Unreal, and close Visual Studio, if you haven't already.

66
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:23,500


67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
So, I'm actually going to do the commit with you this time, because I want to show you now to use tags

68
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,500
briefly. This is a good time to introduce it, so I'm going to go and get my file

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,500
name, over here, and I'm going to come back to the Source Control.

70
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Try and get focus back. I'm going to Commit just as normal,

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,500
pushing up to the web. That's fine! Or I'll leave the push, for now actually, because I want the tag to go with it.

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,500
OK, so I've made a normal commit, but what I want to do now

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
is I want to click on Tag here. And then,

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I'm not going to show you how to do this on the command line, because you probably already know

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
if you know how to use the command line. So, I'm just going to put tag v.4.11

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
and then, I'm going to tag a specific commit, i.e. this commit, not

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
a whole branch. So, what that's going to do, when I choose the commit

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,500
the top commit and then put 4.11 on it, it's just going to put this neat little tag here,

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,500
and tags will come up on the left. And then, what will happen as more commits come into this line,

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
the 4.11 tag will stay there, provided I've tagged a specific commit,

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
and that just reminds me when I upgraded to 4.11. I mean,

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
it's quite clear from the name of the lecture, in this case, but I just wanted

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
to show you how to use tags. So, that's it! In case you haven't already done it, your challenge is to upgrade your

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
project, go through the upgrade process I just showed you, ensure the new project runs

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
OK, and then, commit the changes and optionally tag the specific commit

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
with 4.11 or something similar. So, go ahead and do that now. Recap

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
the video if you need to, and I will see you in the next video!

88
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,600
