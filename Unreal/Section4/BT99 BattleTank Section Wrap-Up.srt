00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Phew!! That was a long section wasn't it?! Well congratulations

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
on getting to the end of it! I've needed to keep this section within 100 videos

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for various technical reasons. to do with the way we produce videos. But actually. it's just

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about exactly the right time to finish this section but not to finish the development

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of the game. Let me explain what I mean by that. When you do the

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
next section. I'm going to want you to come back and continue to add to Battle Tank.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and I'm going to want you to do the same thing with Building Escape. which I'll talk you through in a moment.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So firstly. let's just recap what we've done in Battle Tank! We've worked on

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
landscapes. terrain. you saw a trick for making low poly terrain. We've talked

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
about NavMesh Bounds Volumes. we've talked about making noise

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in the land and raising and lowering terrain. a whole bunch of stuff like that.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We've look at the AI system or at least had a little glance into that. and we've already

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
modified the AI system. intercepting that RequestDirectMove call there.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so that the tanks. driven by the AI. have to move just like our

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
player tanks do. which makes things super fair. If you just let the AI drive it. on its own.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
these tanks move around in a really kind of robotic rigid sort of way. which is not

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
great. You've learned User Interface for the first time. so please go back

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to Building Escape and add some User Interface. You've learned a lot more about C++ and

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Blueprint and what goes where. right. Hopefully you feel now that you know when

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to do things in C++. basically most of the time. and when it's appropriate

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to be using Blueprint. when you're referencing assets or when you're doing something that's very visual

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
by nature or UI related. And finally. you've learned a whole ton more

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
C++. Congratulations on that! It's a tough language. it's a tough engine. you've done

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
really really well! And hopefully you've even had a whiff of game architecture. you understand

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a little bit more about what it takes to put a more complex game together. So what I'd

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
like you to do now. as a final challenge is. just before you go into the next section.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
go and dust off Building Escape for me. And I've got a few little notes over there. as to what

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'd like you to do. So number 1. consider putting your project under version control.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Get setup under Git. now that you've got some idea how to make that work. Add a

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Start Menu to at least Building Escape. so you don't just dive into the game like

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that. Create at least one new puzzle. using something you've learned in this section.

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I don't mind what it is. whether it's the line tracing or whether its

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
something to do with AI. i don't mind. but make another puzzle and show us what you've made

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
over in the community.gamedev.tv forum. And we'd love to see how you've

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
improved Building Escape. it feels great to go back to those old projects and improve them.

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Add some landscape around the room. the rooms just sitting there. floating in mid air. Why not

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
put a landscape around it this time?! And consider a projectile based

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
puzzle. I'm saying. add another puzzle. One of those things you could do is use projectiles. maybe have to

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
hit a switch on the wall. something like that. and maybe you could even make some improvements

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to the overall code and architecture of the game. So please go back.

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
spend a little while. As long as you've like. I don't mind if you spend half an hour or half a

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
month going back and improving Building Escape. but that will really cement your learning. because

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it's easy. kind of easy to follow through Battle Tank just doing what

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I do. like monkey say monkey do. And that's great! I'm sure you're

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
doing the challenges. I really hope you are. but even going through and doing the challenges

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
is not quite the same as completely reapplying that knowledge to a previous

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
[Ooh. I'm wanted]. to a previous  project. So. I hope

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you've enjoyed the section. Go improve Building Escape. and then. I'll see you in the

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.466
next section!
