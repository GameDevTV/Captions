00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So welcome to Improving

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Tank Aiming! The purpose of this video is to just make sure that our tank always takes the short

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
route. So we'll end up with our tank on the hill with a literal glass ceiling in the sky to

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
help us put some pressure on the aiming system. and us and the AI tanks.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
by the end of it. should be aiming more directly. no barrels going around the

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.866
wrong way. So I'll see you in there!

7
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:25.866
So let's look at improving this aim! Now these

8
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:29.866
two AI tanks. I'm not going to delete them this time because you may have placed them very carefully.

9
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.866
What it is about them that we don't want. when we're trying to do this

10
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.866
aiming testing. is we don't want them shooting at us. So we can just select them

11
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:41.866
and then. under their Details. Pawn section. you can say Auto Possess AI

12
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:45.866
Disabled. And the effect that will have is that the AI tanks

13
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.866
just don't aim at us. they're just sitting ducks ready for us to shoot at them. I can't

14
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.866
resist shooting at this guy with my crazy beach ball projectile! There you go! OK

15
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.866
great! So now we can stand and look much more carefully at our aiming. So

16
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:01.866
what's wrong with the aiming? Well you've noticed. probably. that it does some strange things.

17
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:05.866
Sometimes it goes the long way around. but also look what happens if I point at the sky.

18
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:09.866
Well firstly. we need to be careful when we look at this. This

19
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:13.866
is only moving the barrel. when we get a solution to the

20
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:17.866
aiming. and it hits something in the world. if you remember how the AimingComponent works.

21
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:21.866
So that we can focus on one thing at a time. I'm just going to

22
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:25.866
go to the tank blueprint and turn up the Launch Speed

23
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:29.866
to say 20.000.

24
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:33.866
and just test that that is enough to get the projectile even right over to the other

25
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.866
side of the world. So yeah. it's finding a solution even on that hillside there.

26
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:41.866
So now we are saying that. OK it's only aiming now

27
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:45.866
when it finds something to hit. but look what happens if we aim at the sky! You see it's

28
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:49.866
slewing around crazily! So what's going on there? Why is it trying to aim. even

29
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:53.866
though we're not hitting anything? If we go to Show... Sorry! To the

30
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:57.866
Lit button here and down to Visibility Collision. you'll see there is

31
00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:01.866
nothing to hit out there. it is just a sky. So

32
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:05.866
what's going on? There's something wrong with the code in the TankPlayerController. because that's

33
00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:09.866
the thing that tells it where to aim. So I'm interested in whether this GetSight

34
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:13.866
RayHitLocation thing. which is the boolean that determines whether we

35
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:17.866
aim or not. I'm interested in what that is every frame. so I'm going to just factor it

36
00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:21.866
out of here. I'm just going to say auto or bool. It is going to be a bool. so

37
00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:25.866
let's just do that this time. Bool GetSightRayHitLocation.

38
00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:29.866
And I better give it a name. b

39
00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:33.866
GotHitLocation

40
00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:37.866
= that. OK. now I've factored it out so I can log it. So I'll pop it

41
00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:41.866
back into the brackets. So far we've done nothing. we've just moved that out. but what this does mean

42
00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:45.866
now is. that before we even go into the if statement we can now log this. Now how do you log

43
00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:49.866
a boolean? I wonder if you know? What do you think? What do you think I'm going to type?

44
00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:53.866
Any idea? OK. well a boolean's

45
00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:57.866
internally stored as an integer. so one of the easiest ways of doing that is

46
00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:01.866
to use %i for integer. If you were to go to "printf0

47
00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:05.866
C++". something like that. then

48
00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:09.866
in the printf reference you will get this here. "signed decimal

49
00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:13.866
integer". I'll pop this in the lecture resources for you. that link. OK. so

50
00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:17.866
an easy way to get the answer out of a bool is to just say

51
00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:21.866
%i. Then. we can pop the boolean in.

52
00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:25.866
and we can log that every frame. It's going to be quite instructive. let's have a look!

53
00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:29.866
What I'm hoping will happen is it will say. yes I've got a hit. when I'm aiming at anything

54
00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:33.866
like a tank. the ground. or even

55
00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:37.866
well not when I hit the sky [Laughs] basically. So the tank or the ground. anything

56
00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:41.866
where the player. the Visibility Collision. when we go to

57
00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:45.866
this button and click there. anywhere that's visible I should be getting  1. And then. when I go up

58
00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:49.866
there. I should be getting 0. So let's see if that's the case. and just clear

59
00:03:49.866 --> 00:03:53.866
the log.

60
00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:57.866
Not sure I am yet.

61
00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:01.866
Yeah. so we're not. we're not getting 0. It's not saying I can't hit anything.

62
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:05.866
even though it's aiming at the sky. So what's wrong? Well let's go look at the code!

63
00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:09.866
What's the method that it calls? It is calling GetSightRay

64
00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.866
HitLocation. Let's look at GetSightRayHitLocation. Look. by default. if it

65
00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:17.866
can't get a LookDirection it's returning true. Well that's wrong. it should be returning false.

66
00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:21.866
And the other problem with it is that. if this

67
00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:25.866
thing here fails we should also return false. but this thing here is a boolean.

68
00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:29.866
so we want to return that. So our two simple changes are. we return false by default

69
00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:33.866
and we return the result of this GetLookVectorHitLocation. that way

70
00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:37.866
we will generally get false and we'll only get true if we actually hit something that is

71
00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:41.866
visible. So let me recompile! And as I say. what I'm hoping now is that when I aim at anything

72
00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:45.866
that's not gray. in this visibility collision view. that we get a

73
00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:49.866
0 being logged out and that the aiming will stop.

74
00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:53.866
So let's have a look up at the sky. Yeah. 0 gets logged out. and then. down at the ground

75
00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:57.866
or a tank and up at the sky. Great! OK so that's

76
00:04:57.866 --> 00:05:01.866
good news! That's much better! Now to test that a little bit further and give us the

77
00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:05.866
ability to aim right up in the air. a little trick would be. you could put a glass ceilling

78
00:05:05.866 --> 00:05:09.866
in here. I'll just show you how to do that! And that will allow us to aim right up. to really

79
00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:13.866
test the movement of the barrel. So you could pop a cube in the scene. fairly high.

80
00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:17.866
I'm going to make sure the padlocks are undone and scale it by 1.000.

81
00:05:17.866 --> 00:05:21.866
1.000. 10. And if I come

82
00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:25.866
down there it is. it's all big and black. I'm going to put it up a bit higher so there's a gap

83
00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:29.866
between it and the mountains. and then. from the starter pack. I'm just going to assign a

84
00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:33.866
glass material to it. So by putting a glass. literal

85
00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:37.866
glass ceiling in here... Something's gone funny! That's because I changed.

86
00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:41.866
I chose the wrong thing. Glass. there you go!

87
00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:45.866
And what's happened to the scaling?

88
00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:49.866
Hah. you know what I did? I

89
00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:53.866
changed the Static Mesh in my hurry. so what you've actually got is. you've got a

90
00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:57.866
cube as your Static Mesh and your materials should be Glass. Cool!

91
00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:01.866
Alright. so let's have a look! If I now aim there. between the glass and

92
00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:05.866
the mountain I get 0 logged out. and when I aim at the glass I get 1. The other benefit

93
00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:09.866
of this is. it means we can actually test what happens if we aim really high in the sky. What

94
00:06:09.866 --> 00:06:13.866
happens if I'm aiming there or there or up here

95
00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:17.866
or there. You know. and is our aiming behaving

96
00:06:17.866 --> 00:06:21.866
itself? Let's try going up on the mountain top. for a minute. I'll get the Xbox

97
00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:25.866
controller going and just make sure now that we have pretty much a full

98
00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:29.866
sphere of places that we can aim. that the aiming is behaving

99
00:06:29.866 --> 00:06:33.866
itself. So it's important that aiming behaves. even when the tank's on a slope like this.

100
00:06:33.866 --> 00:06:37.866
I'm going to just aim at the glass ceiling. fire. make sure it hits that point on the glass

101
00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:41.866
ceiling. It does appear to. Let's aim behind me. I want to make sure that the aiming

102
00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:45.866
always takes the shortest route. as well. from where we are to where we want

103
00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:49.866
to be. So maybe it's better go to even further up this hill. so I can

104
00:06:49.866 --> 00:06:53.866
really. from the top of the hill. get a huge almost like a sphere of different places

105
00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:57.866
that you can aim. You want to put pressure on your aiming system. because you can be pretty sure that you're player will.

106
00:06:57.866 --> 00:07:01.866
at some point. Ah look. that's going to wrong way! Did you see that? It's like. what

107
00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:05.866
are you doing barrel or turret rather? You could have gone much shorter

108
00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:09.866
distance! So this is our other problem with the aiming. Let me just move the

109
00:07:09.866 --> 00:07:13.866
Player Start up here. because I think this would be a cool place for the Player Start.

110
00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:17.866
right on top of the hill. So if I just grab it. move it

111
00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:21.866
in that plane. move it up to the top of the hill. test that. Yeah we land

112
00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:25.866
on top of the hill and don't fall off. Cool! So how then are we going to fix that

113
00:07:25.866 --> 00:07:29.866
problem with the aiming? Well that's going to be your challenge. Let me just get you to the right place.

114
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:33.866
It's in the TankAimingComponent. our problem. and if you remember what we do. we work out

115
00:07:33.866 --> 00:07:37.866
the difference between the barrel and the aim. and then. we just do a

116
00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:41.866
Rotate by an amount of Yaw. What we need to do is protect that and say. well it depends

117
00:07:41.866 --> 00:07:45.866
how much Yaw we're trying to do. If it's more than 180 degrees. then go the opposite

118
00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:49.866
way. That's the hint. that's basically what we're doing. So I want you to make your turret take the short

119
00:07:49.866 --> 00:07:53.866
route. Use a simple if() statement. Rotate so you always take the short route.

120
00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:57.866
and test it player and AI tanks working again. Go ahead. pause the video. and see if

121
00:07:57.866 --> 00:08:01.866
you can make that take the short route now!

122
00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:05.866
OK welcome back! So I think this is relatively simple.

123
00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:09.866
You can log to the Yaws if you want. to save time. I'm just not going to bother.

124
00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:13.866
I'm simply going to say. if this (DeltaRotator.Yaw)

125
00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:17.766
is less than 180 degrees...

126
00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:21.766
So it turns out there's still a bug in this code. actually. but I'm going to fix that in a

127
00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:25.766
few lectures time. If you want to fix it now. just change (DeltaRotator.Yaw)

128
00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:29.766
for FMath::abs(DeltaRotator.Yaw). like

129
00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:33.766
the annotations at the bottom of the screen. or leave your code like this. observe the bug which is that it

130
00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:37.766
doesn't aim properly when you are changing from either

131
00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:41.766
side of -X in the landscape space.

132
00:08:41.766 --> 00:08:45.766
So if you point your aim down towards -X. behind where

133
00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:49.766
my tank typically has been. which is why I didn't spot it. then the aim will go around the

134
00:08:49.766 --> 00:08:53.733
wrong way. and we'll fix that in a few lectures time.

135
00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:57.733
And you can always play around with the sign of these things. if you're not sure which way it should be.

136
00:08:57.733 --> 00:09:01.733
If it's less than 180 degrees then do what we always did. otherwise

137
00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:05.733
what I want to do is simply rotate in the opposite direction. So that's

138
00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:09.733
pretty meaningful. You just say minus. like that.

139
00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:13.733
OK and I think I'll make a comment here to say. "// Always

140
00:09:13.733 --> 00:09:17.733
yaw the shortest way".

141
00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:21.733
That's pretty simple. right! So just added a simple if case

142
00:09:21.733 --> 00:09:25.733
in there. Let's see if that works. So we'll spawn on top of the hill in a minute. And what we're looking

143
00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:29.733
to do is to make sure that we never end up with the aiming going in a

144
00:09:29.733 --> 00:09:33.733
crazy haphazard opposite direction. I'll also. just for fun. in a moment.

145
00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:37.733
re-enable the AI tanks. but first. let's make sure our aiming behaves. so it's aiming at the

146
00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:41.733
sky. aiming at there. That's difficult to say. because it's so close to

147
00:09:41.733 --> 00:09:45.733
us. but there and then I'd expect it to go left. Yeah. that to

148
00:09:45.733 --> 00:09:49.733
me looks like it's always taking the shortest route now. So if you find any

149
00:09:49.733 --> 00:09:53.733
use cases where it doesn't. let me know. but that's looking a lot better. I'm just going to re-enable

150
00:09:53.733 --> 00:09:57.733
the AI on these enemy tanks here. So you select them

151
00:09:57.733 --> 00:10:01.733
and you say Auto Possess AI. Placed in World. So they have been placed in the world. the AI

152
00:10:01.733 --> 00:10:05.733
will get possessed. I'm going to grab the Xbox controller. dive

153
00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:09.733
down the hill. and of course. we're falling

154
00:10:09.733 --> 00:10:13.733
over which is always quite fun. And are they aiming properly? It doesn't really matter if I fall

155
00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:17.733
over! It's fine if we get hit! You know. in a moment. obviously we're going to change

156
00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:21.733
these projectiles. so they don't send the tank flying so much. But right now. it's actually quite

157
00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:25.733
useful to be hit around a little bit and do some crazy stuff. because again it introduces really weird

158
00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:29.733
conditions in the game that you wouldn't expect and allows us to say. well you know. is

159
00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:33.733
this aiming working or isn't it working? So I don't mind being upside down. I don't mind

160
00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:37.733
all that mess. I just want to drive around and make sure that the aiming

161
00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:41.733
works. but I'm fairly convinced it does. so I'm going to get rid of this unecessary

162
00:10:41.733 --> 00:10:45.733
log entry in here. just by searching the whole project. actually. for "UE_LOG".

163
00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:49.733
And just ask myself. what logs do I really want?

164
00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:53.733
Well I don't want this one anymore. I can leave this as a boolean. that won't slow things down very much.

165
00:10:53.733 --> 00:10:57.733
And that's it. that's all we have! In fact. while I'm here. it's reminded me to look for any "TODO's" in the

166
00:10:57.733 --> 00:11:01.733
project. We'll have to do that when we next look at the AI. We'll look at

167
00:11:01.733 --> 00:11:05.733
the AI shortly. about the acceptance radius. and limiting the AI's firing

168
00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:09.733
rate. Yep good! OK. so that is it. we have better aiming than we

169
00:11:09.733 --> 00:11:13.733
had before! I quite like starting on top of the hill. so I think I'm going to do that. and

170
00:11:13.733 --> 00:11:17.733
well done getting this far! Hopefully your barrels are aiming in the shortest direction.

171
00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:21.733
and [Laughs] it's crazy these projectiles. And it's all a bit of fun. so I'll see

172
00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:23.966
you in the next video!
