00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey guys and welcome to bonus video 1. Switching Cameras!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video I'm going to show you how to switch from first to third

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
person view. like that. Third person. first person. third person. first person.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.900
and it's surprisingly simple.

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.900
Hey and welcome back! So I have solved my 100 lecture

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.900
limit challenge! I'm going to dive into BT100 now. and I

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.900
am going to show you how to change to a first person camera. that's been popularly

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.900
demanded over on our voting site. So if I just show

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.900
you that. if you go to voting.gamedev.tv. and you click

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.900
on UnrealCourse. you can see all the suggestions and things that people are talking about. And

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.900
quite high up here is "Switching from Third to First Person" views. and it got 35

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.900
votes but it's enough that I want to do it and it's pretty simple enough to show you.

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.900
So here we are inside Unreal Engine! The first thing I'm going to do. actually.

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.900
while we talk about feedback from you guys. is to fix a little bug. and for that

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.900
I want to thank DanM. who on community.gamedev.tv has

16
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.900
told us that if you change the way you do the UI. slightly. from the

17
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.900
video. then your line traces in the PlayerController may end up hitting the UI

18
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.900
effectively. And we want to change ECC_Visibility to ECC_Camera to get

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.900
around that. that will give you guys more options. So let's just do that! We

20
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.900
go into VisualStudio. we go into the TankPlayerController C++

21
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.900
under the GetLookVectorHitLocation or whatever you've called your method. and

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.900
when we do our line trace. instead o ECC_Visibility we change it to ECC_Camera.

23
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.900
And that just changes what it hits. and what it doesn't hit it changes the filtering

24
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.900
and can remove a bug for you. So I'm going to compile! While I'm

25
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.900
compiling. I'm just going to remind you that when you are at our side. like community

26
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.900
.gamedev.tv. or voting.gametv. you can actually switch between them if it stops

27
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.900
loading this thread. At the top here. you can just click

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
Voting there. Community there. and so on and

29
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.900
Udemy just takes you to the courses. OK. so let's see if that compile

30
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.900
has finished! I think it has! And if we just play the game. it should play exactly as

31
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.900
it was before. [Laughs] apart for our ego. that's fine. I was just inside the

32
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.900
terrain. So what I had there was. my camera was just inside the terrain. OK. so

33
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.900
nothing's changed. but if you decide to say put your health bar rather than

34
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.900
where it is here. on the tank. which kind of floats if the tank

35
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.900
depossess like that. Some people are putting their health bar in the corners of the screen.

36
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.900
If you're doing that then there's a risk that you line trace and hit your own User Interface.

37
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.900
and then things go wrong. then your barrel ends up sticking up in the air. So

38
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.900
that small change to the code that I've made there. inside the TankPlayerController

39
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.900
C++ will solve that. O.K. Now. how do we

40
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.900
get a first person camera working? You go to the tank blueprint. Let's

41
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900
go duplicated the existing camera that's there. and then. with the new camera.

42
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.900
let's just move it and stick it on top of the tank and rotate it till its

43
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.900
about horizontal. Now. I don't know exactly where we want it until we look through it.

44
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.900
but something like that is going to be OK for me. So now. we have two cameras.

45
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.900
Camera and Camera1. I'm just going to Compile and Save. If I show you now.

46
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.900
nothing changes because we've not told the system to switch to the other camera yet.

47
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.900
So in order to be able to switch to the other camera we need some new input. so I'm going to go to the

48
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.900
Project Settings. Input. and I want you to bind an action. In my case. I'm going

49
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.900
to use a controller button. so I'm just going to say Switch or

50
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.900
Swap Cam. and then. I'm going to use the Gamepads

51
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.900
Face Button Top. which is the

52
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.900
Y button on an Xbox controller. triangle. I think. on a PS4

53
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900
controller. Or use a key. no problem! So you've got a new Action Mapping.

54
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.900
so that gives you a Swap Cam thing there! Now I don't like these cameras being named the same. that's

55
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.900
really named meaninglessly. That is confusing. so I'm just going to say

56
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.900
3rd Person and then I'm going to say 1st Person on this guy. F2.

57
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.900
by the way. is a shortcut to rename. Oops. not F1!

58
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.900
F2. 1st Person. There we

59
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.900
go! Let's just Compile and Save that blueprint and go

60
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.900
into the Event Graph! Now. in the Event Graph. you will now have. if you right-click. a

61
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.900
Swap Cam event. of course. Now what I want

62
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.900
you to do is to see if you can make this camera swapping work. If you search for toggle.

63
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.900
come off the depressed and search for "toggle". you're going to find

64
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.900
some Toggle Active. Activation methods. which pretty much do

65
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.900
it for you. So look. why don't you just finish it off for the satisfaction of it. Search for

66
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.900
"toggle" node. See if you can make it work. [Laughs] it's as simple as that.

67
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.900
and you'll be surprised how easy it is. Of course. you're going to need to toggle both cameras. so go ahead.

68
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.900
pause the video. see if you can make Camera Swapping work then!

69
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.900
Awesome welcome back!

70
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.900
So let's see how this works! So if I push the Camera Swap button.

71
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.900
then I want to Toggle Active the (1st Person) camera.

72
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.900
and it automatically drags in a reference to it. You see that? And then. immediately after that.

73
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.900
it doesn't matter which order because it's going to happen so quickly we're never even going to

74
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.900
realize we Toggle active the (3rd Person).

75
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.900
And that's it! Now if we want to comment that block. we can just say Camera

76
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.900
Swapping. and that should

77
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.900
pretty much be it. Now. arguably Camera Swapping is a...

78
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.900
I'll just put that note back. sorry. Edit. Undo Delete selection.

79
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.900
What I want to do is take this Camera Swapping stuff. cut it. and put it in

80
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.900
Input Setup. because really it is just Input Binding isn't it? Why have it over

81
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.900
in the Event Graph. when it could be in Input? And that's the thing. these are all just Event Graphs and

82
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.900
you can move them around. That makes more sense to me. OK. Compile and Save and

83
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.900
let's see if it works. it may need a minor adjustment but let's see! So there I am. I...

84
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.900
Oh. I need the controller on. so I'm just turning the Xbox controller on now.

85
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.900
and as soon as it comes alive. which it has now. I can push

86
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.900
Y and there you go I swap! Now this other camera. there's something wrong with it. and that

87
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.900
is because the camera we are starting with. and well done if you

88
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.900
worked this out. this 1st Person camera is starting as active

89
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.900
and we don't want it to be active in the beginning. OK.

90
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.900
We want it to be inactive. in the beginning. so that the 3rd Person camera is active. in the

91
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.900
beginning. and the 1st Person camera is inactive. The problem with the 1st Person camera

92
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.900
being active is. we're just getting some arbitrary default camera view that we're switching

93
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.900
to. which is of the root transform of the tank in the middle. if both cameras start as active.

94
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.900
The whole point of this toggle here is that we're toggling the activity.

95
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.900
You see Toggle Active. so you need to start 3rd Person

96
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.900
active and 1st Person inactive. OK. so let's try that!

97
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.900
If I hit Y now. ah hah. and actually that's not far off.

98
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.900
that view. I'm going to stick with that and now I've got a 1st Person view! So there you go.

99
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.900
that has been done! So well done and I will see you later!

100
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.933

Hey guys and welcome to bonus video 1, Switching Cameras!

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video I'm going to show you how to switch from first to third

Face Button Top, which is the

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Y button on an Xbox controller, triangle, I think, on a PS4

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,900
controller. Or use a key, no problem! So you've got a new Action Mapping,

54
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,900
so that gives you a Swap Cam thing there! Now I don't like these cameras being named the same, that's

55
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,900
really named meaninglessly. That is confusing, so I'm just going to say

56
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,900
3rd Person and then I'm going to say 1st Person on this guy. F2,

57
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,900
by the way, is a shortcut to rename. Oops, not F1!

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,900
F2, 1st Person. There we

59
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,900
go! Let's just Compile and Save that blueprint and go

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,900
into the Event Graph! Now, in the Event Graph, you will now have, if you right-click, a

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,900
Swap Cam event, of course. Now what I want

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,900
you to do is to see if you can make this camera swapping work. If you search for toggle,

63
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,900
come off the depressed and search for "toggle", you're going to find

64
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,900
some Toggle Active, Activation methods, which pretty much do

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,900
it for you. So look, why don't you just finish it off for the satisfaction of it. Search for

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,900
"toggle" node. See if you can make it work, [Laughs] it's as simple as that,

67
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,900
and you'll be surprised how easy it is. Of course, you're going to need to toggle both cameras, so go ahead,

68
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,900
pause the video, see if you can make Camera Swapping work then!

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,900
Awesome welcome back!

70
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,900
So let's see how this works! So if I push the Camera Swap button,

71
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,900
then I want to Toggle Active the (1st Person) camera,

72
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,900
and it automatically drags in a reference to it. You see that? And then, immediately after that,

73
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,900
it doesn't matter which order because it's going to happen so quickly we're never even going to

74
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,900
realize we Toggle active the (3rd Person).

75
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,900
And that's it! Now if we want to comment that block, we can just say Camera

76
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,900
Swapping, and that should

77
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,900
pretty much be it. Now, arguably Camera Swapping is a...

78
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,900
I'll just put that note back, sorry. Edit, Undo Delete selection.

79
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,900
What I want to do is take this Camera Swapping stuff, cut it, and put it in

80
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Input Setup, because really it is just Input Binding isn't it? Why have it over

81
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,900
in the Event Graph, when it could be in Input? And that's the thing, these are all just Event Graphs and

82
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,900
you can move them around. That makes more sense to me. OK, Compile and Save and

83
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,900
let's see if it works, it may need a minor adjustment but let's see! So there I am, I...

84
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,900
Oh, I need the controller on, so I'm just turning the Xbox controller on now,

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,900
and as soon as it comes alive, which it has now, I can push

86
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Y and there you go I swap! Now this other camera, there's something wrong with it, and that

87
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,900
is because the camera we are starting with, and well done if you

88
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,900
worked this out, this 1st Person camera is starting as active

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,900
and we don't want it to be active in the beginning, OK.

90
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,900
We want it to be inactive, in the beginning, so that the 3rd Person camera is active, in the

91
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,900
beginning, and the 1st Person camera is inactive. The problem with the 1st Person camera

92
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,900
being active is, we're just getting some arbitrary default camera view that we're switching

93
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,900
to, which is of the root transform of the tank in the middle, if both cameras start as active.

94
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,900
The whole point of this toggle here is that we're toggling the activity.

95
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,900
You see Toggle Active, so you need to start 3rd Person

96
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,900
active and 1st Person inactive. OK, so let's try that!

97
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,900
If I hit Y now, ah hah, and actually that's not far off,

98
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,900
that view. I'm going to stick with that and now I've got a 1st Person view! So there you go,

99
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,900
that has been done! So well done and I will see you later!

100
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,933
