00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So hi

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and welcome to Aiming Without the Tank! By the end of the video we will have refactored all our

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
aiming code. so that aiming still works. and we will have broken a bunch of dependencies. Our

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
diagram will be looking like this. by the end. Notice that the Tank is almost

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
extracted from the equation. and we've lost at least a couple of dependencies. We've lost the

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.166
lines from the AI Controller and the Player Controller into the Tank. which is good news. So see you in there!

7
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.166
So we are good to go on this aiming refactor.

8
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:34.166
So just before I start and set you into a challenge. I want to get rid of this annoying log

9
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:38.166
entry. If you'll remember. in the Tank blueprint. we've got a couple of logs

10
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.166
that we'd put in to do with the construction order. I'm going to get rid of that on the Tank Blueprint

11
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:46.166
Construction Script and this Print String in the Event Graph

12
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:50.166
and just recompile. and just make sure that if we clear the logs now and move and

13
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:54.166
hover over these things or play the game that we only get what we want.

14
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:58.166
which is just this one error here about the Barrel. which is to do with firing

15
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:02.166
and we are going to ignore for now. OK let's get to it! In fact.

16
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:06.166
I'm going to challenge you to to ahead and aim without the tank. Move just the aiming

17
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:10.166
code from the tank. Remember that we were going to keep a copy of the LaunchSpeed in the tank.

18
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:14.166
so that all the inbound calls and all the

19
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:18.166
code in the tank still compiles. The firing doesn't work. but the code needs to compile.

20
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:22.166
Move any forward declarations and includes that you need to. and just check that all

21
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:26.166
tanks can now aim. even though we're not doing the aiming via the tank

22
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:30.166
anymore. So go ahead. pause the video. see if you can make that part of the refactor now.

23
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:34.166
OK

24
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.166
welcome back! So I'm going to use. actually. my raw slide here. just as a way of

25
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:42.166
keeping track of what dependencies we've broken as we go through. So

26
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:46.166
where do we start then? We need to. as I said. get

27
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:50.166
rid of aiming on the Tank. So let's start at the top of the Tank.h. Does it

28
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:54.166
need a TankAimingComponent? Well it shouldn't need a TankAimingComponent.

29
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:58.166
Let's just see where we use that. in the current document.

30
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:02.166
We use it here. we keep a pointer to the AimingComponent. so that can all go.

31
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:06.166
The protected section of the tank. with this AimingComponent pointer can go.

32
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:10.166
Do we use this anywhere else? Nope. so now the forward declaration

33
00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:14.166
of UTankAimingComponent can go in the Tank.

34
00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:18.166
Let's talk about the same thing. the TankAimingComponent. Let's do a Find.

35
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:22.166
without case sensitivity and see what we need to get rid of.

36
00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:26.166
Do we need to be finding the TankAimingComponent? No not anymore. that was just to get

37
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:30.166
this to green. We're going to get rid of the AimAt method alltogether.

38
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:34.166
and that is the only reference to TankAimingComponent. So we can

39
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:38.166
remove the #include for TankAimingComponent altogether. from the

40
00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:42.166
Tank.cpp. So what have we just done in terms of dependencies? We have just

41
00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:46.166
got rid of this dependency. The Tank no longer depends on the Tank Aiming

42
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:50.166
Component. That is cool news! So let's just take

43
00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:54.166
a look at what code changes I've made. because I appreciate that a refactor video like this can

44
00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:58.166
be a little bit hard to follow. So what I need to do is just save all in Visual

45
00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:02.166
Studio. pop into the code tracking tool.

46
00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:06.166
SourceTree here. and just show you that in the Tank.h. Let's

47
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:10.166
start there. these are the changes that I've made on the screen. on the right-hand side there. I deleted those

48
00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:14.166
lines and in the Tank.cpp I've deleted those lines.

49
00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:18.166
OK fantastic! Let's carry on with this refactor. because we have definitely more work

50
00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:22.166
to do. We need to get to compilation as quickly as possible. In the tank header

51
00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:26.166
file. we had an AimAt() method. That is the thing that we are

52
00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:30.166
wanting to move into the TankAimingComponent. So let's cut the AimAt

53
00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:34.166
and make sure that it already is in the TankAimingComponent.

54
00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:38.166
Now it is but look. the signature is different. And the reason the signature

55
00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:42.166
is different is because the AimingComponent used to need to know the LaunchSpeed that was stored on the tank.

56
00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:46.166
but now we're going to have a copy of the launch speed

57
00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:50.166
right here on the AimingComponent. So. let's go get that. Here's our

58
00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:54.166
TankAimingComponent. sorry our Tank. and here is our LaunchSpeed.

59
00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:58.166
Let's put that in the AimingComponent. We don't need to the TODO to say remove it.

60
00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:02.166
because this is going to be the only place it ends up. Now what happens is.

61
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:06.166
when we call AimAt. we don't actually need a launch speed. That's going to affect

62
00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:10.166
things upstream right. that's going to affect the AI Controller and the Player Controller.

63
00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:14.166
but we'll fix that in a second. Yeah. it will affect them a

64
00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:18.166
little bit. It won't affect the signature. because they never did call into Tank with the LaunchSpeed.

65
00:04:18.166 --> 00:04:22.166
but they do need to get the AimingComponent. we'll see that in a minute. The basic point

66
00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:26.166
is. we're moving the AimAt over into here. and then. let's take a look at the Tank

67
00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:30.166
AimingComponent and it's AimAt() method. We just need to change its signature.

68
00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:34.166
OK so there's a start! Now. at this

69
00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:38.166
point I would say let's compile. let's see what's not going to work. I can anticipate what's not

70
00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:42.166
going to work! For example. the AI Controller and the Player Controller

71
00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:46.166
are going to have problems trying to call into the Tank. right now. I think.

72
00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:50.166
because there's not AimAt method in it. but let's use the Compiler to help us find what's

73
00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:54.166
wrong and we can just start going through its issues. So AimAt is no longer a member

74
00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:58.166
of Tank. There you go. in the TankPlayerController! Let's go sort that out!

75
00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:02.166
Now. to sort that out. I'm going to do the PlayerController. you're going to do the AIController.

76
00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:06.166
Well I say that. if you haven't already done this challenge. I'm giving you a second chance.

77
00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:10.166
which is I'm going to help you by doing this with the PlayerController. and then. you can pause the video as a

78
00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:14.166
second chance at the challenge. if you need it. and you can do the AI. So

79
00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:18.166
what's happening in this TankPlayerController?

80
00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:22.166
It goes and gets the ControlledTank. Now what does GetControlledTank do. firstly?

81
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:26.166
I think it's a really thin method that does almost nothing. Yeah.

82
00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:30.166
it just returns the Pawn. and it actually doesn't need to cast this Pawn to a

83
00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:34.166
Tank. because a Tank is a Pawn. So we can remove the cast

84
00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:38.166
and. in fact. while we're at it. let's look for ATank in this document.

85
00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:42.166
Where else do we use ATank? It's the only place

86
00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:46.166
we actually use the ATank type. So because I've removed the cast.

87
00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:50.166
I can actually get rid of the #include Tank.h in the TankPlayerController.

88
00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:54.166
What does that do for our dependencies? It gets rid of this line here.

89
00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:58.166
Progress! OK that's cool! So let's go look at

90
00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:02.166
the TankPlayerController.cpp. Do we also have ATank.

91
00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:06.166
sorry. the TankPlayerController header file? I'm just going back to the header

92
00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:10.166
file. because I was just in the .cpp. We have a ATank. yeah where are we using that? Let's find

93
00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:14.166
it. in this GetControlledTank. Let's

94
00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:18.166
ditch GetControlledTank! I'm ditching the method altogether and the forward declaration!

95
00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:22.166
Again. that is because we've broken this PlayerController to Tank link. This is good. this

96
00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:26.166
is progress in the right direction! So we don't

97
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:30.166
even need a GetControlledTank method. We can just GetPawn(). when we're supposed to be getting

98
00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:34.166
ControlledTank. so let's get rid of this method altogether.

99
00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:38.166
and in the header field. which we've already just done I think. Yeah.

100
00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:42.166
Now let's go search for GetControlledTank.

101
00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:46.166
like so. And then say. well where do we

102
00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:50.166
use it? Well we use it up here. we go and get an AimingComponent up here in BeginPlay().

103
00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:54.166
and then we go and find it. and then we ensure we have it. and then we

104
00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:58.166
report that we found it. We do that at BeginPlay(). We want to do exactly the same

105
00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:02.166
thing every time we aim. and the reason we need do it every time is because we may have depossessed

106
00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:06.166
the Tank. we may have died and depossessed the Tank. So we want to do something

107
00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:10.166
very similar to this. So instead of GetControlledTank it's just GetPawn now.

108
00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:14.166
in this instance. and that should fix that bit. And then. down here

109
00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:18.166
we want to do a very very similar thing. In fact. I'm just going to use this

110
00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:22.166
code here and put it straight in here.

111
00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:26.166
We find the AimingComponent. the same way. inside the AimTowardsCrosshair.

112
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:30.166
If we don't have it we . otherwise we

113
00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:34.166
don't need to get the ControlledTank AimAt. we just need to say Aiming

114
00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:38.166
Component AimAt.

115
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:42.166
So hopefully that makes sense. let's reuse the compiler

116
00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:46.166
to help us with where we are. and once it compiles. I will show you

117
00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:50.166
the source control changes again. so you can catch up. By the way. if you're having

118
00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:54.166
trouble following what I'm doing. in a big refactor video like this. remember that you can always go

119
00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:58.166
to github.com/UnrealCourse. click on BattleTank. click on the

120
00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:02.166
Commits here. or go to this URL which I will paste in the lecture

121
00:08:02.166 --> 00:08:06.166
resources for you. and then. you will see the next

122
00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:10.166
video. BT76. But let's imagine it's already there. you can see all the changes by

123
00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:14.166
clicking on it. OK so that's that! Now let's go back to Unreal.

124
00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:18.166
see how far we've got. Where's Unreal? There it is! Compile Failed! Let's find

125
00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:22.166
out why! So this area is an interesting one. In the TankPlayerController 21

126
00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:26.166
it's talking about missing a pointer type. Let's go look at it! It's actually a

127
00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:30.166
bogus error. It's got a problem at line 21 because. when I deleted

128
00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:34.166
whatever I deleted here... What did I delete there? Let's look at the source control.

129
00:08:34.166 --> 00:08:38.166
in the TankPlayerController.h I deleted something.

130
00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:42.166
Yeah the GetControlledTank. I forgot to take the UFUNCTION annotation

131
00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:46.166
with it. so that's what's confusing it. Let's get rid of that!

132
00:08:46.166 --> 00:08:50.166
Perfect! Now let's try the compile again! So that's a strange sort of error.

133
00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:54.166
You see the error's telling you it's expecting a pointer type. whereas it's actually just reading a UFUNCTION

134
00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:58.166
and then expecting something below that it's not seeing you know. so it's a bogus error.

135
00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:02.166
I get a lot of these bogus errors! Let's try compiling now. see how well we've done with

136
00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:06.166
our code changes! We have another compile failure.

137
00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:10.166
so " 'AimAt': is not a member of 'ATank' in the TankAIController. So here

138
00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:14.166
is your second mini challenge. We seem to have done it OK for the PlayerController. it's at

139
00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:18.166
least compiling. Let's see if we can get the AIController. if you can get the

140
00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:22.166
AIController to do exactly the same pattern as we just followed with the playercontroller. Go ahead pause

141
00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:26.166
the video and see if you can get that working!

142
00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:30.166
OK welcome back! So the TankAIController.

143
00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:34.166
well firstly. it includes a Tank.h. we don't want that. Remember over here.

144
00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:38.166
we don't want the AIController including the Tank. so I remove the #include.

145
00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:42.166
I'm also going to go to the header file and say. do I really want the

146
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:46.166
Tank in there. It's not in there. so we're good. so we can focus

147
00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:50.166
in the C++ file of the AIController. We remember. don't need

148
00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:54.166
these casts. In fact. we can't even have these casts now that we've removed the #include.

149
00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:58.166
So ATank is a Pawn. so we don't need to change the type. we can do all

150
00:09:58.166 --> 00:10:02.166
these operations on a Pawn perfectly well. So we ensure...

151
00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:06.166
Well let's actually. let's use our normal pattern. If

152
00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:10.166
not (!ensure(PlayerTank)) && Controlled

153
00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:14.166
Tank))

154
00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:18.166
in return. And what this means

155
00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:21.166
is. all of this code now doesn't need to be in braces. doesn't

156
00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:26.166
need to be indented. Shift. Tab to take them back. much simpler. OK so we move to the Actor and

157
00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:30.166
then we say ControlledTank AimAt the (Player. Well it's

158
00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:34.166
not the ControlledTank that we do that with is it? It is the

159
00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:38.166
AimingComponent of the ControlledTank.

160
00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:42.166
So we're just going to say auto AimingComponent

161
00:10:42.166 --> 00:10:46.166
=

162
00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:50.166
ControlledTank

163
00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:54.166
FindComponentByClass

164
00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:58.166
UTank AimingComponent. Now we actually need to create

165
00:10:58.166 --> 00:11:02.166
a dependency here. because we want the AIController to depend on the Aiming

166
00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:06.166
Component. So we're going to do a #include that we didn't have before.

167
00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:10.166


168
00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:14.166
It's one of the green lines on our graph.

169
00:11:14.166 --> 00:11:18.166
That's pretty cool! So now it will recognize UTankAimingComponent. when it

170
00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:22.166
catches up with us. So we

171
00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:26.166
go get the AimingComponent. and then. as the AimingComponent...

172
00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:30.166


173
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:34.166
...AimAt that we do. Now. ControlledTankFire. Fire wasn't working

174
00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:38.166
before. we don't expect it to work now. but it should be

175
00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:42.166
OK. Fire should be still a method... No it's not! It's not a

176
00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:46.166
method on a Pawn anymore. because remember we removed the Tank include. We

177
00:11:46.166 --> 00:11:50.166
were casting from Pawn to Tank. Pawns don't

178
00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:54.166
have a Fire() method on it. We're not trying to fix firing. firing doesn't work anyway. We

179
00:11:54.166 --> 00:11:58.166
comment it out and we put a TODO which is

180
00:11:58.166 --> 00:12:02.166
"fix firing". OK we're focusing on aiming. let's

181
00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:06.166
recompile! Keeping the scope of these things down is really important.

182
00:12:06.166 --> 00:12:10.166
Notice how long these videos would be. if I wasn't breaking it

183
00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:14.166
into stages for you. And each of these videos represents you sitting down between a couple of cups of coffee.

184
00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:18.166
your green tea [Laughs] or whatever you drink. and we want to keep these small. So aiming

185
00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:22.166
is working! Aiming is working! Awesome! Let's see if we've got any new

186
00:12:22.166 --> 00:12:26.166
errors on our console! We actually haven't even got any errors

187
00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:30.166
on our console now. because we're not trying to fire. because I just commented out that

188
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:34.166
Fire line in the AIController. We have Aiming

189
00:12:34.166 --> 00:12:38.166
working. under the new architecture. which is fantastic news. If you look

190
00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:42.166
over on our diagram. look how good a job we've done. we've nearly decoupled the Tank.

191
00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:46.166
We're still working. we've still got these two things talking to the Projectile. Great news.

192
00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:50.166
this is a perfect time to just go into your project. Save

193
00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:54.166
All. close it down...

194
00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:58.166
What have we got here? "Graph is linked to a private object(s) in an external package."

195
00:12:58.166 --> 00:13:02.166
"Try to find the chain references". "(may take some time)?"

196
00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:06.166
The Tank Blueprint failed to save. This happens sometimes.

197
00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:10.166
It's OK. that's not the end of the world. there isn't anything too valuable in the Tank Blueprint. What I would

198
00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:14.166
be tempted to do is save what you can here. not the Tank Blueprint.

199
00:13:14.166 --> 00:13:18.166
Close down your VisualStudio.

200
00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:22.166
Oops. I've just reopened it! And then. reopen your Tank. but just

201
00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:26.166
before you commit. if you get an error just before you commit like this. then open it up again. Oh I know why!

202
00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:30.166
You know why? I had two copies of the Unreal Editor open. that's what the problem

203
00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:34.166
was. You can actually get that in Windows. you see them here? So only have

204
00:13:34.166 --> 00:13:38.166
one of these open. Let's just make sure that our aiming works.

205
00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:42.166
It does! If you want to be super sure you compile. to make sure you're compiling on the latest code.

206
00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:46.166
You can see that it is! The Tank Blueprint. it's saying that it's got a problem. Let's compile

207
00:13:46.166 --> 00:13:50.166
it and now we really are happy. Save All. Another useful bit of value there.

208
00:13:50.166 --> 00:13:54.166
two editors open could lead to weird errors. And let's Commit our work. because we've done a

209
00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:57.632
great job! See you in the next video!
