00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey, you're welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Setting Up a GitHub Repo, which is short for repository. In this video, we're going to be creating a

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
online repository for your project. GitHub provides

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
free public hosting for you. We'll use a default

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
UnrealEngine .gitignore file, rather than writing it ourselves from scratche now.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We'll then clone what we made on the web, down to our local machine,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and, as I said, I will show you how to make a readme.md

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
file with something called markdown. Now, that is a simple language

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that's like an HTML simplification, and there's a link there you could

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
follow to find out more about markdown. So, by the end of the video what we will have is, we will have an

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
online repository like this that will be part of

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in my case, a series which is one per section, and we'll have some

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
commits online, which will match what we have locally here. So, we basically have an

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
online backup of our repository, and this allows us to share our code with other students.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.600
So, let's dive in and see how this is done!

16
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.600
So, hopefully by now you've been using SourceTree or similar, to good effect.

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600
But we've only so far talked about this in terms of the local storage,

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.600
which is fine but at some point we want to backup, we want to share our work with other people,

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.600
etc. So, this is where the public GitHub page comes in! Here's my

20
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.600
page! Do follow me on GitHub, then you can see all the stuff I produce!

21
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.600
So, what you're going to want to do on GitHub, to get yourself a remote repository, is consider

22
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.600
firstly whether you're just going to post as yourself or whether you are

23
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.600
going to setup an organization. So, I've got it organized into

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.600
an organization per course. You may want to do the same thing. You may want to setup

25
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.600
a Unreal course organization or something like that, for yourself. That just

26
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.600
allows you to group a bunch of repositories together, so if

27
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600
I look at my Unreal course organization, it has one

28
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.600
repository for each section, and then,

29
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600
the repository, like Building Escape, when we go into it has the source code

30
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.600
and some description, which we'll talk about in a minute, but it also has all forty-six

31
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.600
commits which relate to the lectures that I produced.

32
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.600
OK, so you might want to do something very similar. It's up to you exactly when you commit,

33
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.600
but I'm suggesting you do it after each video, just to get in the habit.

34
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600
So, if you're already used to SourceControl and Git and you know how this website

35
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.600
works, you probably just want to skip straight onto the next video. All I'm going to be

36
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.600
doing is creating a repo here on GitHub. I'm going to use the

37
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
default .gitignore that GitHub provides for Unreal, and I'm going to write a brief

38
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.600
readme.md file in markdown. So, that's just to let you know

39
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.600
what I'll be doing. So, firstly we need to make sure we're actually signed

40
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.600
in. So, at this point, I'm not signed in at the top-right. I've got the option to sign

41
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.600
in. There we go! Done! And then, I'm going to create myself

42
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.600
a new repository, either against my user or in my case against

43
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.600
an organization called Unreal Course. Note the naming

44
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.600
convention. I'm going to use a very consistent naming, 04_

45
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.600
BAttleTank. OK

46
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600
great! So, we're going to say a brief description. "An open-world

47
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.600
head-to-head tank fight

48
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.600
with simple AI, terrain,

49
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.600
and advanced control

50
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.600
system

51
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.600
in Unreal 4. OK great! It's going to be public! You can't

52
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.600
make it private without paying. OK, now I am going to initialize

53
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.600
the project with a readme file, and it's a readme.md which is markdown.

54
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.600
In the first slide of this video, there is a link to

55
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.600
the markdown cheat sheet, or to be honest, just do a Google search for markdown

56
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.600
cheat sheet or syntax.

57
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.600
And even if you don't spell it right, you'll get something like this daring fire ball

58
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.600
one, and it'll tell you how markdown works. It's actually very simple. It's a way of writing

59
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.600
HTML without writing HTML, basically. This was written by a blogger.

60
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.600
It's a very cool idea! So, we're going to initialize with a readme. It lets other people know what your repository

61
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.600
is about, when they get to the webpage. And we're also going to use now, this time, now that you've seen how

62
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.600
a .gitIgnore is built up, why give ourselves the pain of building it

63
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600
up from scratch? Why don't we just type Unreal in here,

64
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600
and realize that people have already made one and it's going to be good enough.

65
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600
License, it's up to you if you put a license in. I'm going to leave no license here.

66
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.600
And let's click Create Repository!

67
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.600
Great! So, there we go, we have Battle Tank now! "An open-world head-to-head tank fight"

68
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.600
game, a simple AI. So, this is the beginning of my readme.md, but it's a bit

69
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.600
rubbish. So, one of the first things I'm going to want to do here is

70
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600
to edit this readme. You can click on it and you can click the little Edit  This File.

71
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.600
Then, you can go in and you can see what it's doing. Hash is

72
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.600
the level 1 heading. OK, so BattleTank. Now, rather than me building

73
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.600
this from scratch, what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up a

74
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.600
previous repository, I'm going to go into its readme file,

75
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.600
edit this, and this is the markdown code

76
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.600
for it. I'm going to take all of this stuff here, including the first

77
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.600
lecture, and right

78
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.600
up to the third lecture, because most of that's going to be reused. Note, some of the things

79
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.600
in here. You've got links that are done like this in square brackets, then in circular

80
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.600
brackets the link. It's all in the cheat sheets. Stars, do a bullet

81
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.600
list, double hashes level two heading, single hashes level one heading

82
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.600
OK. So, let's just paste that in

83
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.600
and make sure all of this works OK.

84
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.600
OK, so Intro Notes and Section Assets is

85
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.600
BE01. And it's not BE anymore, I'm using a code which

86
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.600
is BT, Battle Tank. Hey, there are my initials, BT!

87
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.600
And the second one was Game Design Document, and I'll literate the rest later.

88
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.600
So, by editing this game design document, I'm actually

89
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.600
making a commit here. So, what I'm actually going to do first is

90
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.600
commit the first video I made, which is that one there, and I'm just going to call it...

91
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.600
What I do for my commits is, I actually call them the name of the lecture,

92
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.600
and normally I put in the description something about it, but I'm just going to do this

93
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.600
for now. So, by editing your readme you're making a commit,

94
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.600
alright. Now, look how that's formatted! The stars became this

95
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600
line, the links all work, etc.

96
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.600
Alright, so have a play with markdown, write yourself a little primer

97
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.600
for your repository. Now, if I go back and look at Battle Tank now,

98
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.600
I can see I've got two commits, an initial commit, and I've got BTO1 Intro,

99
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.600
Notes & aection Assets. Alright, so the second

100
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.600
video that I made was called something else. It was the

101
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600
GD one. So, I could edit the markdown file again and recommit. This

102
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.600
is how I commit files where there's actually been no code

103
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.600
changes. So, let me just do that really

104
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.600
quickly. 04_Battle Tank, README.md,

105
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.600
edit it, put in the other video which is star,

106
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.600
after a bullet point, BT02 for Battle Tank video 2, Game

107
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.600
Design Document

108
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.600
(GDD). OK, and then let's just

109
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600
commit this as exactly that name. And the reason is, I want

110
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.600
to give you a bit of a repository to pull down to your local machine, alright.

111
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.600
So now, we've got two commits, two edits to this. The page is updated,

112
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.600
this thing at the bottom appears, that we've just put in, but if we were to look at our

113
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.600
Battle Tank 3 Commits, you can see it's

114
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600
starting to come together. Cool, so we have a remote repository now! This is the point,

115
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.600
this is where we've got to. So, how do we get this into our SourceTree? We go to

116
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.600
the File, and then New, and then clone stroke new. That's where we want to

117
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.600
go, and we're going to clone. Now, I have already

118
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.600
connected my SourceTree, as you already have, to your GitHub, so when you click on the little world

119
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.600
icon here, Browse Hosted Projects, you'll get a list come up. Now, I could

120
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.600
search for "battle", and of all my things, I should get Battle Tank.

121
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.600
Cool! And I can literally just say Clone now!

122
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.600
As simple as that! And what that's going to do is, it's going to pull down the contents of that very small repo

123
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.600
that only contains that readme file and the .gitignore, and it's

124
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.600
going to pop it over here. I've got a bookmark. If I look at the master branch,

125
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.600
which I can see that I've got a readme file, and I can see the historical

126
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.600
changes there. I've got a .gitignore that's got a lot more in it than before, which we've taken from

127
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600
the GitHub website

128
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.600
and that's it! We're pretty much ready to go! In fact, I'm at a stage now where I'm ready to commit

129
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.600
the next video. I could edit the readme file locally, of course,

130
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.600
by just double-clicking it. I could commit this video, which is BT03

131
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.600
Setting Up a GitHub

132
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.600
"Repo". And that's all I've done in this

133
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.600
video, I haven't really made any code changes. So, if I save that readme file,

134
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.600
then of course, I'll see some uncommitted changes here

135
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.600
saying that I've done this. And then, I can commit that

136
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
and we're back to our familiar workflow, which works the other way around,

137
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.600
of course, which is that we go from our local to

138
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.600
the web, but you haven't see me do that yet. So, what we've done previously

139
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.600
is, we've given a commit a name and we've committed like this, and it

140
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.600
arrives here right. Now, you have a checkbox, Show Remote Branches. In the Mac it's

141
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.600
the dropdown. You can see that the master, which we're on

142
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.600
locally, is here, but the origin master and by default the GitHub repository

143
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.600
is called origin, is one behind, and that's why the push has

144
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.600
one symbol. It's saying that what you have locally is one behind what is

145
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.600
on the web. So, you can click Push, push the local

146
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.600
master to the remote master, and OK. And what that's

147
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.600
going to do is just transmit that very simple change, that I'm only doing for

148
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.600
demonstration purposes, up to the web. If we now go back to the GitHub website and refresh,

149
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.600
you can see that we will, in a moment, have BT03. You see!

150
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.600
So that's it, it's now on the web! This link here,

151
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.600
04_BattleTank is the URL that you could share with somebody, and they can get

152
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.600
hold of all our source and they can look up different branches if you set them up

153
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.600
and they can look at all your commits and get to your project at any point in

154
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.600
history. So, that's what I want your challenge to be. I want you to setup your own remote repo

155
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.600
on GitHub or BitBucket. Write your first readme.md.

156
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.600
Why not include your GDD in there, for example?

157
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.600
And then, share the repo link with us, so that we can all have a look at your project as

158
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.600
it progresses. Once you've shared that link once, it'll stay up to date as you push to the web.

159
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.600
Pretty cool, hey! And I've already done that, so this is just your challenge

160
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.600
to get it done for yourself, and I look forward to seeing you in the next video!

161
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.500
