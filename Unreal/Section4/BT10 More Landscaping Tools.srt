1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
More Landscaping Tools! In this video. we're going to be showing you how to make flat

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
shading optional inside your landscape material properties. Importing and exporting

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
landscape heightmaps. which are an image file that represents the landscape layout.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Reducing the resolution of the landscape. There's one very simple way of doing this.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in a few clicks. If you want to go from high to low poly. with some limitations.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And importantly. using a texture in a landscape material. rather than

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
just having completely flat shading. So. by the end of it. I'll have

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a finalized low poly landscape like this. which will actually have some material still

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
flat shading but actually have a material that has some texture to it like this.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and it will be an inescapable terrain where all the

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
sides are too steep for the tank to leave. So. that's important and we

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.233
have our battle arena. So. see you in there!

14
00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:54.233
So. let's start with how to add a texture to our terrain. This

15
00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:58.233
technique will apply to high and low poly terrains. In fact. I'm going to leave the

16
00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:02.233
landscape material. so that you can either make it flat shaded or not flat shaded

17
00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:06.233
very easily. So. let's go find a texture first! One easy way to do that is to go

18
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.233
to the Content tab. Add New. and then. Add Feature or Content

19
00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:14.233
Pack. and this is a way of getting our starter content in after the events.

20
00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:18.233
So. no point in starting the Starter Content. if you don't need it. but if we want it now we can just go to

21
00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:22.233
Content Packs. Starter Content. and add it to the project.

22
00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:26.233
Now. in that Starter Content under Materials. notice a couple of things. We've got

23
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:30.233
a couple of useful things in here. One is M_Ground

24
00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:34.233
_Grass. So that's the grass material. If we look at it. we'll

25
00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:38.233
see that under the Usage section. it does have use with landscape ticked.

26
00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:42.233
so it is designed to be used as a landscape. And we'll find the same with the gravel. M_

27
00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:46.233
Ground_Gravel. So the question is. how do we use these actual textures

28
00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:50.233
rather than these flat colors? We want the flat shading still.

29
00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:54.233
potentially. We want to be able to choose flat shading. on or off. Solid colors like. we might want

30
00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:58.233
a solid color for snow. but we're also going to want some textures. so let me show you that.

31
00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:02.233
What we do is. we go ahead and find our material. so

32
00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:06.233
that's in Content. and then let's work on the FlatLand

33
00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:10.233
one for now. And what we're going to do is replace these flat colors

34
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:14.233
here with actual textures. So what you do is you do a search for texture.

35
00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:18.233
and you'll find Texture Sample. That's the one we want.

36
00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:22.233
OK. so I'm going to get myself a couple of texture samples. Just

37
00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:26.233
Duplicate and we're going to take the output of the

38
00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:30.233
Texture Samples into the layers. So. that's the same as

39
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:34.233
using flat colors. The only difference is they're going to want some UV maps.

40
00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:38.233
and that's going to tell these textures where on the landscape they're going to be. So. we look

41
00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:42.233
for the Landscape section. Then. we're looking for

42
00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:46.233
LandscapeLayerCoordinates. That's what we want! And you plumb that into both

43
00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:50.233
of your texture samples. for both the grass and the dirt. And then.

44
00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:54.233
all you need to do is. for the grass. you go and find the grass. So. you go over to

45
00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:58.233
the Details tab. under the Material Expression Texture Base.

46
00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:02.233
and then. Texture. use the dropdown. type grass.

47
00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:06.233
and choose that. And then. the same for the

48
00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:10.233
gravel. Now you've got two on the gravel. You've got a normal map and

49
00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:14.233
a detail map. We're going to use just the detail. for the moment. that's just the color the albedo the

50
00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:18.233
base color. The normal map would allow you to set some roughness.

51
00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:22.233
Now talking about roughness. we have this absolute world position here.

52
00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:26.233
We are not going to use that now. the flat shading. or we want the option to be able to use

53
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:30.233
it. so in a moment we're going to kind of find a way of commenting this out in Blueprint. But for now. let's just

54
00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:34.233
check the effect of changing to Texture Samples. instead of flat

55
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:38.233
colors. So. I'm just going to save this up.

56
00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:42.233
minimize. and then. when this recompiles.

57
00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:46.233
we'll see the effect. I quite like the effect of having flat shaded low poly

58
00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:50.233
but with a texture. The game The Witness. that fantastic puzzle game that came out in

59
00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:54.233
2016. that has this type of effect. low poly but with

60
00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:58.233
textures on it. And now you can see the effect. OK. We have

61
00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:02.233
exactly the same painting as we had before. but now. we

62
00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:06.233
can. with a sufficiently small brush. we can come in and paint

63
00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:10.233
dirt where we want it. grass where we want it. and get quite an interesting looking effect.

64
00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:14.233
I think. Fantastic. so that is how you use textures. You can use that on a high

65
00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:18.233
or a low poly landscape. The other thing I want to show you is. how to make flat shading

66
00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:22.233
optional. So. one very simple way of doing that is if you come in and hit

67
00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:26.233
C for Comment. you can then put a Comment block. It's better. actually. if

68
00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.233
you just. before you hit C for Comment. if you select the blocks that you want to comment

69
00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:34.233
about. then hit C. and it'll put a Comment block around this. And you can

70
00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:38.233
say. Wire to... Oops. if I can type correctly. Wire to

71
00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:42.233
Normal for flat shading.

72
00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:46.233
OK. Wire to Normal for flat shading. and then.

73
00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:50.233
that gives you a group that you can move around. And if we just break the link. by right clicking.

74
00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:54.233
and then save. we've got some nodes here that are ready to use if we want to enable

75
00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:58.233
Flat Shading. So. that's pretty cool! Let's just save that up and see what that looks like.

76
00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:02.233
and what's going to happen now is. we won't have the flat shading anymore. So.

77
00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:06.233
on a high poly landscape this is what you would want. You'd want to turn off the Flat Shading like that.

78
00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:10.233
and have smooth shading and this will look absolutely fine. There you go!

79
00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:14.233
So. this is ready to go for a high poly style. alright.

80
00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:18.233
You may get some repetition of your textures. it looks a bit odd on a large landscape.

81
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:22.233
and isotropic filtering on your graphics card will help with that.

82
00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:26.233
But at the moment. we're just trying to make the first iteration of this landscape. alright.

83
00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:30.233
So. I'm actually going to stick with low poly. so I'm going to delete my landscape material.

84
00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:34.233
I don't need that. I'm going to leave FlatLand. I'm going to rewire it to Normal. like that.

85
00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:38.233
I want to stick with low poly because I want to get off landscapes now. I want to move

86
00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:42.233
onto the tank and moving and controlling the tank. The least fun thing about this game.

87
00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:46.233
right now. is not the landscapes. it's the fact it hasn't even got a tank in it. right. But I want

88
00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:50.233
to show you a couple of other landscape tools. just before we leave this. So. the first thing I want to show you

89
00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:54.233
is the concept of exporting your own height map. So. you come to Landscape

90
00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:58.233
tab to sculpt and then down to the target layers. You right-click. it's a bit

91
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:02.233
hidden on the height map. and you can say Export to File. So. I'm just going to do that quickly.

92
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:06.233
I'm just going to call it test. and if I go look at this

93
00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:10.233
test. let's go look at the .png. you can see it's a small .png.

94
00:06:10.233 --> 00:06:14.233
I need this one. because my landscape is relatively low res. You can see the

95
00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:18.233
tiny bit of landscape I've built up on the right-hand side here. just a slightly lighter

96
00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:22.233
coloring. Alright. so that's what a height map is. it's a top-down view. Now. luckily one of

97
00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:26.233
our students. Chris. has provided us with a much more detailed height map. You're welcome to import

98
00:06:26.233 --> 00:06:30.233
that. There it is! So. that is a height map that

99
00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:34.233
has got a lot more detail. and it's created with something called TerraGen. Let me just show you how you would

100
00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:38.233
import that. if you wanted to. What you could do is. you could add a...

101
00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:42.233
Well. actually one of the easiest things to do here is just to create yourself

102
00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:46.233
a new scene altogether. So. just make a new level. a new

103
00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:50.233
empty level. saving what we've got. and then. work on another level if you want to

104
00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:54.233
experiment high versus low. if you're not decided yet. So. in this new level.

105
00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:58.233
we can then come to Landscapes. Manage. Import from File.

106
00:06:58.233 --> 00:07:02.233
go grab the file that's attached to this very lecture. There it is!

107
00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:06.233
Now. notice this is a 5 by 5 kilometer landscape. but we're just going to go with that.

108
00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:10.233
for the moment. just so I can demonstrate what this would look like.

109
00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:14.233
Now. what we need is a landscape material here. so let's go

110
00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:18.233
and find the World Outliner. find the landscape.

111
00:07:18.233 --> 00:07:22.233
Go assign a material to it. which I'm going to use Flat

112
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:26.233
Land here. Now. the other problem. if you look. is why

113
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:30.233
is this rendering so poorly in this new scene. Well. if you go compare it to the

114
00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:34.233
other scene that we've got. which is the BattleGround. so I better save this scene

115
00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:38.233
as BattleGround_High.

116
00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:42.233
Let's just go look at the other scene and see what's missing.

117
00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:46.233
right. So. if you look in this scene in the World Outliner. we've got Atmospheric Fog a Directional

118
00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:50.233
Light. a Light Source. a Lightmassimportance volume. a Player Start.

119
00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:54.233
Sky Sphere. We've got all this stuff that we don't have over here

120
00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:58.233
in this new BattleGround_Hight. because it was empty when we created it.

121
00:07:58.233 --> 00:08:02.233
So. one thing you can do is just paste all that in.

122
00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:06.233
I just copied those from the other scene or level

123
00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:10.233
and pasted them in here. Now. you can see the beauty of what TerraGen has created. This landscape

124
00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:14.233
really does look like it's been crafted with water basically

125
00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:18.233
or something like that. It looks very natural. The problem with this landscape. as it stands. is that you

126
00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:22.233
could easily drive a tank. say up this valley here. over the top. and then.

127
00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:26.233
down the back. and you could end up discovering the end of the world. And we don't want to be discovering

128
00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:30.233
the end of the world. So. I just wanted to show you how you could do this type of import. I'm actually not going to use

129
00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:34.233
this landscape right now. It's setting the bar too high. It's too beautiful. I'd have to do too much

130
00:08:34.233 --> 00:08:38.233
work with materials and textures. and this could turn into a whole course on landscaping. which it

131
00:08:38.233 --> 00:08:42.233
isn't. So. I'm going to pop back to my BattleGround. my low poly

132
00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:46.233
battleground here. having showed you that. Oh hang on. one more thing!

133
00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:50.233
There is one other thing I want to show you. which is you may want to convert a high poly landscape to a low poly landscape.

134
00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:54.233
Let me show you a really quick way of doing that! You can go into the Landscaping tool of modes.

135
00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:58.233
you can go into Manage. and then. down to Change

136
00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:02.233
Component Size. and you can go from 255 quads. say down to 15

137
00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:06.233
and select Resample. So. you would reduce your selection size and

138
00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:10.233
then Resample. If you apply that. let's just see what that looks like.

139
00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:14.233
There you go! So. now we've got a TerraGen generated low poly

140
00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:18.233
style landscape. which is quite interesting. but the resampling can

141
00:09:18.233 --> 00:09:22.233
lead to some really inconsistent polygon sizes. So. it is a possibility

142
00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:26.233
for you changing size but it's not recommended. I would rather you just built low poly

143
00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:30.233
landscapes from scratch. because you could get some really weird artifacts that you're seeing here.

144
00:09:30.233 --> 00:09:34.233
But you may be interested in that. so I wanted to put it in for you. Let's go back to my

145
00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:38.233
low poly landscape here. I'm going to stick with this style

146
00:09:38.233 --> 00:09:42.233
for now. and I'm just going to really quickly make it what I'm looking for. which is

147
00:09:42.233 --> 00:09:46.233
just a really simple mountainous area around the outside. that

148
00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:50.233
prevents us from leaving. So. I'm just going to go ahead and sculpt

149
00:09:50.233 --> 00:09:54.233
with a large brush and a strong

150
00:09:54.233 --> 00:09:58.233
a strong large brush. and just get it all sculpted up.

151
00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:02.233
And it's surprising

152
00:10:02.233 --> 00:10:06.233
how well just going around and roughly destroying around the edges of the landscape can

153
00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:10.233
actually work. and if you do low poly landscapes like this. then you

154
00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:14.233
get to see your geometry and you get a more consistent set of polygon

155
00:10:14.233 --> 00:10:18.233
sizes. OK. now Unreal is really good with high poly stuff and you can make

156
00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:22.233
beautiful interesting looking high poly landscapes and

157
00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:26.233
we'll cover some more of the things like post processing effects and the lights later. But to

158
00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:30.233
keep my time down and the amount of time you need to watch me just

159
00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:34.233
sculpting landscapes. I'm going to stick with this low poly stuff. but all of the techniques

160
00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:38.233
I just showed you apply to high poly as well.

161
00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:42.233


162
00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:43.266


163
00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:47.266


164
00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:51.266


165
00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:55.266
So. a little hint for you. if you're having trouble seeing things

166
00:10:55.266 --> 00:10:59.266
in shadows. is you can switch from lit to unlit mode. and that will allow you to really

167
00:10:59.266 --> 00:11:03.266
quickly just see the landscape without worrying about where the shadows are.

168
00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:07.266
Then. you can paint your gravel on the shaded or sloped sides of the

169
00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:11.266
mountains. really quite easily. It really only matters what it looks like from the middle of

170
00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:15.266
the arena. because that's the only place that the tanks are going to be judging it

171
00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:19.266
from. It's quite usual for things that you can't see to not be looking right.

172
00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:23.266
that just saves time in the production.

173
00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:27.266
So. I'm just going to quickly pop these gravel kind of colors down here.

174
00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:31.266
on the sides. making sure that it's good enough for now bearing in mind that

175
00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:35.266
you can change everything. and iterate and want to be changing and iterating regularly.

176
00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:39.266
And then. we are done. we have an arena! You've seen high poly. you've seen low poly.

177
00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:43.266
you've seen flat shaded. you've seen smooth shaded.

178
00:11:43.266 --> 00:11:47.266
you've seen using materials that use either textures or just

179
00:11:47.266 --> 00:11:51.266
flat colors. and basically you have everything you need to create simple

180
00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:55.266
landscapes. or even go and get yourself a trial of TerraGen or the like and make something

181
00:11:55.266 --> 00:11:59.266
really really fantastic looking. So. if I go back to Lit now. then we have

182
00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:03.266
a pretty cool looking low poly layout. It's fine

183
00:12:03.266 --> 00:12:07.266
for me. it's a great arena. and I'll see you in the next video where we'll

184
00:12:07.266 --> 00:12:09.032
start actually making the tanks work!

=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, welcome to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
More Landscaping Tools! In this video, we're going to be showing you how to make flat

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
shading optional inside your landscape material properties. Importing and exporting

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
landscape heightmaps, which are an image file that represents the landscape layout.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Reducing the resolution of the landscape. There's one very simple way of doing this,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
in a few clicks. If you want to go from high to low poly, with some limitations.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And importantly, using a texture in a landscape material, rather than

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
just having completely flat shading. So, by the end of it, I'll have

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a finalized low poly landscape like this, which will actually have some material still

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
flat shading but actually have a material that has some texture to it like this,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and it will be an inescapable terrain where all the

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
sides are too steep for the tank to leave. So, that's important and we

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,233
have our battle arena. So, see you in there!

14
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:54,233
So, let's start with how to add a texture to our terrain. This

15
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:58,233
technique will apply to high and low poly terrains. In fact, I'm going to leave the

16
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:02,233
landscape material, so that you can either make it flat shaded or not flat shaded

17
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:06,233
very easily. So, let's go find a texture first! One easy way to do that is to go

18
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,233
to the Content tab, Add New, and then, Add Feature or Content

19
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:14,233
Pack, and this is a way of getting our starter content in after the events.

20
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:18,233
So, no point in starting the Starter Content, if you don't need it, but if we want it now we can just go to

21
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:22,233
Content Packs, Starter Content, and add it to the project.

22
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:26,233
Now, in that Starter Content under Materials, notice a couple of things. We've got

23
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:30,233
a couple of useful things in here. One is M_Ground

24
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:34,233
_Grass. So that's the grass material. If we look at it, we'll

25
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:38,233
see that under the Usage section, it does have use with landscape ticked,

26
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:42,233
so it is designed to be used as a landscape. And we'll find the same with the gravel. M_

27
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:46,233
Ground_Gravel. So the question is, how do we use these actual textures

28
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:50,233
rather than these flat colors? We want the flat shading still,

29
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:54,233
potentially. We want to be able to choose flat shading, on or off. Solid colors like, we might want

30
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:58,233
a solid color for snow, but we're also going to want some textures, so let me show you that.

31
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:02,233
What we do is, we go ahead and find our material, so

32
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:06,233
that's in Content, and then let's work on the FlatLand

33
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:10,233
one for now. And what we're going to do is replace these flat colors

34
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:14,233
here with actual textures. So what you do is you do a search for texture,

35
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:18,233
and you'll find Texture Sample. That's the one we want.

36
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:22,233
OK, so I'm going to get myself a couple of texture samples. Just

37
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:26,233
Duplicate and we're going to take the output of the

38
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:30,233
Texture Samples into the layers. So, that's the same as

39
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,233
using flat colors. The only difference is they're going to want some UV maps,

40
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:38,233
and that's going to tell these textures where on the landscape they're going to be. So, we look

41
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:42,233
for the Landscape section. Then, we're looking for

42
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:46,233
LandscapeLayerCoordinates. That's what we want! And you plumb that into both

43
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,233
of your texture samples, for both the grass and the dirt. And then,

44
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:54,233
all you need to do is, for the grass, you go and find the grass. So, you go over to

45
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:58,233
the Details tab, under the Material Expression Texture Base,

46
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:02,233
and then, Texture, use the dropdown, type grass,

47
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:06,233
and choose that. And then, the same for the

48
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:10,233
gravel. Now you've got two on the gravel. You've got a normal map and

49
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:14,233
a detail map. We're going to use just the detail, for the moment, that's just the color the albedo the

50
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:18,233
base color. The normal map would allow you to set some roughness.

51
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:22,233
Now talking about roughness, we have this absolute world position here.

52
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:26,233
We are not going to use that now, the flat shading, or we want the option to be able to use

53
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:30,233
it, so in a moment we're going to kind of find a way of commenting this out in Blueprint. But for now, let's just

54
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:34,233
check the effect of changing to Texture Samples, instead of flat

55
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:38,233
colors. So, I'm just going to save this up,

56
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:42,233
minimize, and then, when this recompiles,

57
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:46,233
we'll see the effect. I quite like the effect of having flat shaded low poly

58
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:50,233
but with a texture. The game The Witness, that fantastic puzzle game that came out in

59
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:54,233
2016, that has this type of effect, low poly but with

60
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:58,233
textures on it. And now you can see the effect, OK. We have

61
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:02,233
exactly the same painting as we had before, but now, we

62
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:06,233
can, with a sufficiently small brush, we can come in and paint

63
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:10,233
dirt where we want it, grass where we want it, and get quite an interesting looking effect,

64
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:14,233
I think. Fantastic, so that is how you use textures. You can use that on a high

65
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:18,233
or a low poly landscape. The other thing I want to show you is, how to make flat shading

66
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:22,233
optional. So, one very simple way of doing that is if you come in and hit

67
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:26,233
C for Comment, you can then put a Comment block. It's better, actually, if

68
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:30,233
you just, before you hit C for Comment, if you select the blocks that you want to comment

69
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:34,233
about, then hit C, and it'll put a Comment block around this. And you can

70
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:38,233
say, Wire to... Oops, if I can type correctly. Wire to

71
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:42,233
Normal for flat shading.

72
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:46,233
OK, Wire to Normal for flat shading, and then,

73
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:50,233
that gives you a group that you can move around. And if we just break the link, by right clicking,

74
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:54,233
and then save, we've got some nodes here that are ready to use if we want to enable

75
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:58,233
Flat Shading. So, that's pretty cool! Let's just save that up and see what that looks like,

76
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:02,233
and what's going to happen now is, we won't have the flat shading anymore. So,

77
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:06,233
on a high poly landscape this is what you would want. You'd want to turn off the Flat Shading like that,

78
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:10,233
and have smooth shading and this will look absolutely fine. There you go!

79
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:14,233
So, this is ready to go for a high poly style, alright.

80
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:18,233
You may get some repetition of your textures, it looks a bit odd on a large landscape,

81
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:22,233
and isotropic filtering on your graphics card will help with that,

82
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:26,233
But at the moment, we're just trying to make the first iteration of this landscape, alright.

83
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:30,233
So, I'm actually going to stick with low poly, so I'm going to delete my landscape material.

84
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:34,233
I don't need that. I'm going to leave FlatLand, I'm going to rewire it to Normal, like that.

85
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,233
I want to stick with low poly because I want to get off landscapes now. I want to move

86
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:42,233
onto the tank and moving and controlling the tank. The least fun thing about this game,

87
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:46,233
right now, is not the landscapes, it's the fact it hasn't even got a tank in it, right. But I want

88
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:50,233
to show you a couple of other landscape tools, just before we leave this. So, the first thing I want to show you

89
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:54,233
is the concept of exporting your own height map. So, you come to Landscape

90
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:58,233
tab to sculpt and then down to the target layers. You right-click, it's a bit

91
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,233
hidden on the height map, and you can say Export to File. So, I'm just going to do that quickly.

92
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:06,233
I'm just going to call it test, and if I go look at this

93
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:10,233
test, let's go look at the .png, you can see it's a small .png.

94
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:14,233
I need this one, because my landscape is relatively low res. You can see the

95
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:18,233
tiny bit of landscape I've built up on the right-hand side here, just a slightly lighter

96
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:22,233
coloring. Alright, so that's what a height map is, it's a top-down view. Now, luckily one of

97
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:26,233
our students, Chris, has provided us with a much more detailed height map. You're welcome to import

98
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:30,233
that. There it is! So, that is a height map that

99
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:34,233
has got a lot more detail, and it's created with something called TerraGen. Let me just show you how you would

100
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:38,233
import that, if you wanted to. What you could do is, you could add a...

101
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:42,233
Well, actually one of the easiest things to do here is just to create yourself

102
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:46,233
a new scene altogether. So, just make a new level, a new

103
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:50,233
empty level, saving what we've got, and then, work on another level if you want to

104
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:54,233
experiment high versus low, if you're not decided yet. So, in this new level,

105
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:58,233
we can then come to Landscapes, Manage, Import from File,

106
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:02,233
go grab the file that's attached to this very lecture. There it is!

107
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:06,233
Now, notice this is a 5 by 5 kilometer landscape, but we're just going to go with that,

108
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:10,233
for the moment, just so I can demonstrate what this would look like.

109
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:14,233
Now, what we need is a landscape material here, so let's go

110
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:18,233
and find the World Outliner, find the landscape.

111
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:22,233
Go assign a material to it, which I'm going to use Flat

112
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,233
Land here. Now, the other problem, if you look, is why

113
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:30,233
is this rendering so poorly in this new scene. Well, if you go compare it to the

114
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:34,233
other scene that we've got, which is the BattleGround, so I better save this scene

115
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:38,233
as BattleGround_High.

116
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:42,233
Let's just go look at the other scene and see what's missing,

117
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:46,233
right. So, if you look in this scene in the World Outliner, we've got Atmospheric Fog a Directional

118
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:50,233
Light, a Light Source, a Lightmassimportance volume, a Player Start,

119
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:54,233
Sky Sphere. We've got all this stuff that we don't have over here

120
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:58,233
in this new BattleGround_Hight, because it was empty when we created it.

121
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:02,233
So, one thing you can do is just paste all that in.

122
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:06,233
I just copied those from the other scene or level

123
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:10,233
and pasted them in here. Now, you can see the beauty of what TerraGen has created. This landscape

124
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:14,233
really does look like it's been crafted with water basically

125
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:18,233
or something like that. It looks very natural. The problem with this landscape, as it stands, is that you

126
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:22,233
could easily drive a tank, say up this valley here, over the top, and then,

127
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:26,233
down the back, and you could end up discovering the end of the world. And we don't want to be discovering

128
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:30,233
the end of the world. So, I just wanted to show you how you could do this type of import. I'm actually not going to use

129
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:34,233
this landscape right now. It's setting the bar too high. It's too beautiful, I'd have to do too much

130
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:38,233
work with materials and textures, and this could turn into a whole course on landscaping, which it

131
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:42,233
isn't. So, I'm going to pop back to my BattleGround, my low poly

132
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:46,233
battleground here, having showed you that. Oh hang on, one more thing!

133
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:50,233
There is one other thing I want to show you, which is you may want to convert a high poly landscape to a low poly landscape.

134
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:54,233
Let me show you a really quick way of doing that! You can go into the Landscaping tool of modes,

135
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:58,233
you can go into Manage, and then, down to Change

136
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:02,233
Component Size, and you can go from 255 quads, say down to 15

137
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:06,233
and select Resample. So, you would reduce your selection size and

138
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:10,233
then Resample. If you apply that, let's just see what that looks like.

139
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:14,233
There you go! So, now we've got a TerraGen generated low poly

140
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:18,233
style landscape, which is quite interesting, but the resampling can

141
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:22,233
lead to some really inconsistent polygon sizes. So, it is a possibility

142
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:26,233
for you changing size but it's not recommended. I would rather you just built low poly

143
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:30,233
landscapes from scratch, because you could get some really weird artifacts that you're seeing here.

144
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:34,233
But you may be interested in that, so I wanted to put it in for you. Let's go back to my

145
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:38,233
low poly landscape here. I'm going to stick with this style

146
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:42,233
for now, and I'm just going to really quickly make it what I'm looking for, which is

147
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:46,233
just a really simple mountainous area around the outside, that

148
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:50,233
prevents us from leaving. So, I'm just going to go ahead and sculpt

149
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:54,233
with a large brush and a strong

150
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:58,233
a strong large brush, and just get it all sculpted up.

151
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:02,233
And it's surprising

152
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:06,233
how well just going around and roughly destroying around the edges of the landscape can

153
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:10,233
actually work, and if you do low poly landscapes like this, then you

154
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:14,233
get to see your geometry and you get a more consistent set of polygon

155
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,233
sizes. OK, now Unreal is really good with high poly stuff and you can make

156
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:22,233
beautiful interesting looking high poly landscapes and

157
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:26,233
we'll cover some more of the things like post processing effects and the lights later. But to

158
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:30,233
keep my time down and the amount of time you need to watch me just

159
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:34,233
sculpting landscapes, I'm going to stick with this low poly stuff, but all of the techniques

160
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:38,233
I just showed you apply to high poly as well.

161
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:42,233


162
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,266


163
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:47,266


164
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:51,266


165
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:55,266
So, a little hint for you, if you're having trouble seeing things

166
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:59,266
in shadows, is you can switch from lit to unlit mode, and that will allow you to really

167
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:03,266
quickly just see the landscape without worrying about where the shadows are.

168
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:07,266
Then, you can paint your gravel on the shaded or sloped sides of the

169
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:11,266
mountains, really quite easily. It really only matters what it looks like from the middle of

170
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:15,266
the arena, because that's the only place that the tanks are going to be judging it

171
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:19,266
from. It's quite usual for things that you can't see to not be looking right,

172
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:23,266
that just saves time in the production.

173
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,266
So, I'm just going to quickly pop these gravel kind of colors down here,

174
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:31,266
on the sides, making sure that it's good enough for now bearing in mind that

175
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:35,266
you can change everything, and iterate and want to be changing and iterating regularly.

176
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:39,266
And then, we are done, we have an arena! You've seen high poly, you've seen low poly,

177
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:43,266
you've seen flat shaded, you've seen smooth shaded,

178
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:47,266
you've seen using materials that use either textures or just

179
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:51,266
flat colors, and basically you have everything you need to create simple

180
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:55,266
landscapes, or even go and get yourself a trial of TerraGen or the like and make something

181
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:59,266
really really fantastic looking. So, if I go back to Lit now, then we have

182
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:03,266
a pretty cool looking low poly layout. It's fine

183
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:07,266
for me, it's a great arena, and I'll see you in the next video where we'll

184
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:09,032
start actually making the tanks work!
