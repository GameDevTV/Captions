00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, welcome to Using

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Landscape Layers. By the end of this video, you will have a very simple

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
visual metaphor of a landscape, with some very unrealistic grass and dirt, but

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
you'll have learned how to actually setup landscape materials,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which are multi-layered. I'll just show you the end result. We're going to create a blueprint that looks

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
something like that. This is a two layered material. And then, we're going to learn how to paint

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,866
it onto the landscape. So, let's dive in and see that work!

8
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:30,866
OK, let's get this landscape painting done! You can either follow me

9
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:34,866
through, or you can wait until the challenge, about midway through where I will recap, on

10
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:38,866
the challenge slide, the six major steps. So, it's up to you which way you do things. Do let me know in

11
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:42,866
the Q & A, by the way, whether you prefer to follow me through or just to watch me and

12
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:46,866
then to have enough details on the challenge slide to complete the challenge without

13
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:50,866
needing to be doing it as you go along in the video. Just let me know which you prefer. So

14
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,866
let's go! What we do in the Content tab is make ourselves a new material, because

15
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:58,866
the landscape is going to need a material. We're going to simply call it Landscape.

16
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:02,866
we're going to go into the material, and then, the next thing we need is, it must

17
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:06,866
be a layered material. So, we go into

18
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,866
Landscape, as a category, and we want Landscape

19
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:14,866
LayerBlend. OK, it adds a LayerBlend node to the Landscape.

20
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,866
What that allows us to do is have multiple different things feeding into the base color

21
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:22,866
of the landscape. In our case, we're just going to have green for grass and

22
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:26,866
just a brownie color for dirt, but you could have snow colors, you could have

23
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:30,866
all sorts of things. You could have textures, any complex materials could be blended in

24
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:34,866
here. We're just going to start with plain colors for now

25
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:38,866
OK. So, that's the Layer Blend Node. Also, if you

26
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:42,866
click on the Landscape Node, there's going to be an item for you to set, which is

27
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:46,866
under usage you've got Used with Landscape.

28
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:50,866
Again, they're both of the challenge slide. So that sets it as a Landscape Material, which means

29
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:54,866
that it doesn't accept more than one indirect balance of light for optimization,

30
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,866
and it also make various other behind the scenes changes, which make it suitable for landscapes.

31
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:02,866
OK, so we've set the Landscape Node as a Used as

32
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:06,866
Landscape, and then, the Layer Blend Node, we need to start creating layers on, because at the moment we

33
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:10,866
have no inputs to this node. So, I'm going to create a layer called Grass,

34
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:14,866
and then another layer in the Details tab, in the layers where it says

35
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:18,866
0 or 1 elements, you add another element. And we're just going to call that

36
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:22,866
dirt. Fantastic! So, how do we set the colors of these? Well, they're

37
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:26,866
accepting an input. What do we want to put in there? Well, we want a color

38
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:30,866
and the way to do that is to look for something called a VectorParameter.

39
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:34,866
And that's one way to do it, VectorParameter. It adds a VectorParameter node.

40
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:38,866
Again, that's on the challenge slide. You take the white overalll

41
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:42,866
parameters, it's a four element parameter R, G, B, and Alpha, which is the

42
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:46,866
transparency. That's all combined into that white node. You pop that into the grass,

43
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,866
and then, go ahead and set the grass as

44
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,866
a greeny color. Now, I'm

45
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:58,866
just going to exit Steam, because I don't want to be hearing about other people

46
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:02,866
playing games, and then, add another node. So, a way of adding a node is...

47
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:06,866
Another way of adding this VectorParameter node is to hold down V, and then, to click

48
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:10,866
in the map. So, that gets you a VectorParameter node, holding down V and

49
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:14,866
just clicking. Wire that one up to dirt and then go and set its color,

50
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:18,866
and there we go. So, what that

51
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,866
is now is, it's made the Landscape Material a two layered

52
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:26,866
material, and the landscape itself is set for use as

53
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:30,866
a landscape type. So, that's all we've done so far. Let's go ahead and save the material.

54
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:34,866
So, it's created a material, set the

55
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:38,866
usage, added a landscape layer blend mode, and added a couple of Vector

56
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:42,866
Parameters. Now, we're going to actually add the layer

57
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:46,866
information. Let me show you what that means. If we go into the Modes tab, back to the Landscape,

58
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:50,866
and then, where we want to go into Paint,

59
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:54,866
it's saying Target Layers here. And we don't actually have currently

60
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:58,866
any Target Layers to paint on. Well, that's because we haven't actually assigned this

61
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:02,866
material to the landscape yet. So, you go to the World Outliner, find

62
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:06,866
Landscape. Then, where it's asking for the Landscape

63
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:10,866
Material, let's give it the material we just created. So, now the landscape has the

64
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:14,866
material we just made. Back in the Paint option of the

65
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:18,866
Modes tab, where it says Target Layers, look there are our layers! Now, we're nearly there! We

66
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:22,866
can 't quite paint with them yet. Why not? Well, let's try! "The layer

67
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:26,866
has no layer info. You must create or assign a layer info".  A layer info is

68
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,866
both basically a map of where this paint is going to go. So, you click

69
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:34,866
a little plus here.

70
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:38,866
Sometimes it's a little bit buggie actually, in this 4.11 version,

71
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:42,866
so let me just see if I can get it to behave off back into

72
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,866
Paint, and then, it's the plus sign you want to click there. Create Layer Info.

73
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:50,866
Weight Blended, we want blended layers. We're not going to go with Non-Weight Blended, that's

74
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:54,866
more advanced. Let it just give, it's going to create a folder, and let's just let it use the

75
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:58,866
default name, Grass_Layer Info, nice and clear. Let's go back

76
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:02,866
and make another layer info for the dirt.

77
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:06,866
So those two assets it's just created, if we look in the Content,

78
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:10,866
are in a folder called BattleGround_sharedassets, and they're basically

79
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:14,866
maps of where this stuff is going to end up. Cool, so with all of those

80
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:18,866
steps in place, we're not able to come along and say right. Let's zoom out a little

81
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:22,866
bit. I'm just going to unlock my Mouse Wheel. There you go!

82
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:26,866
OK cool! Zoom out, pick yourself a brush size,

83
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:30,866
it's quite large in my case, and then, just start painting it in.

84
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,866
OK, so that's how you would paint the grass.

85
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:38,866
Now, remember you can roll the Mouse Wheel up to move faster. And then, the other thing

86
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:42,866
that we need to be painting, of course, is the dirt, which I'm going to be doing with a much smaller brush.

87
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:46,866
Now, if you get this type of

88
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:50,866
artifact, just wait for the lighting to recompile. There you go!

89
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:54,866
So, back down to Dirt.

90
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:58,866
So, if you're having any trouble painting like this, then you need to think

91
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:02,866
about A your brush size, B the brush falloff. So, if there's no

92
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:06,866
falloff, then we are painting purely with the new color.

93
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,866
And then, if there's maximum falloff, then we have a blend between the two colors, but

94
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:14,866
the reason we're having trouble here is because our tool strength is so low. If we're painting

95
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:18,866
with dirt and we want dirt to override everything, we need our tool strength to be very high.

96
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:22,866
So, with a 0 brush falloff and a maximum tool strength, look what happens. Everywhere

97
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:26,866
it touches, it puts pure dirt. You see!

98
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:30,866
And if we turn the target strength down, then

99
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:34,866
what happens is we end up with the green potentially showing through, depending

100
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:38,866
on where it has cashed into it. It's slightly messy the

101
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:42,866
way that it arrives. So, you want a pretty strong brush, all the time here, certainly for

102
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:46,866
this pass. I mean there's a whole lot to painting landscapes right, and all we want to do for the moment

103
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:50,866
is show you that this is a multilayered texture and that you can paint it on.

104
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:54,866
So, I'm going to finish this off after the challenge. I want you to paint your landscape. Create

105
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:58,866
a material for your landscape, if you haven't done it already. Set the usage used with landscape

106
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:02,866
on the Materials Node. Set

107
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:06,866
the Landscape Layer, well add in a LandscapeLayerBlend node, and use

108
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:10,866
Vector Parameters to set at least a couple of colors. As I said, add at least two layers

109
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:14,866
and create their layer infos. Remember when you come back out and go into the Modes tab, we're

110
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:18,866
going to need to create layer infos, so it knows what layer goes where on the map.

111
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:22,866
Then, paint the landscape from the Modes tab, and screenshot and share with us.

112
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:26,866
So, go ahead, pause the video, and get your landscape working now!

113
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:30,866
Welcome back! So, I'm just going to very rough and ready

114
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,866
get this landscape going. By the way, one problem that you may have is in the lee of these

115
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:38,866
hills, there's not enough light. So, the way that I'm going to combat that, very quickly,

116
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:42,866
is to come to Modes and then across to Lights. I'm going to add a

117
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:46,866
Directional Light. Now, it turns out it doesn't matter where in scene a Directional Light sits,

118
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,866
all that matters is its rotation. So, rotate it around till it fills

119
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:54,866
in the shadows a little bit for you, and then, you can

120
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:58,866
turn its intensity all the way down, till it's a subtle fill in effect.

121
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:02,866
And then, I'm going to move the light out of the way, so that it's not annoying me.

122
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:06,866
So, let's just move that right out, say underneath the world,

123
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,866
or if that's irritating to you, you can move it right up in the air. OK,

124
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,866
so that's a way of just being able to see what's going on in these hills. Now, it's just a

125
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:18,866
question of probably first painting the hills with a brown. And as

126
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:22,866
I say, you could go ahead and make a third material in here and make a white for snow if you wanted

127
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:26,866
to, but I'm going to do a really rough landscape to start with, so that we can iterate rapidly

128
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:30,866
around our circle and get on with the tank and then come back and

129
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:34,866
revisit the landscape and repeat. I'm making sure I have a strong tool but

130
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:38,866
also no Brush Falloff, so that I can just put this on the

131
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:42,866
mountains. I can go ahead and paint. Now, there are ways that you can do this, based on height

132
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:46,866
of terrain, which is possible and fine as well, but for now, I just want to go ahead

133
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:50,866
and do a really simple painting just of the hills just to differentiate them,

134
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:54,866
assuming the grass isn't growing on the hills. I'm going to do the hills first, and only

135
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:58,866
what matters from the ground level. If it's not visible from the ground level, it doesn't really matter, which is why I'm

136
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:02,866
doing it from down here right. And going to paint them. Now, this also landscape

137
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:06,866
could be a nice low poly landscape, which we could achieve by turning our number of

138
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:10,866
quads all the way down. It's a little harder to work with low poly, in a way, because the

139
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:14,866
tooling isn't completely default setup for it, so I'm not going to cover low poly

140
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:18,866
right now. But if you're really keen to know, well look. I want to make a simple landscape here

141
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:22,866
and not go for anything too real, and I want to know how to do a low poly, then let me know

142
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:26,866
and I will look to

143
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,866
potentially introduce that a little bit later.  But for now, I'm trying to give you the more general landscape

144
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:34,866
tools, which is that you can work with any landscape. And this stuff can be a little bit laborious,

145
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,866
you just paint it on. There's a lot more we can do with different layer modes, with different

146
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:42,866
brush types, etc. etc. We can tag things by height

147
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:46,866
yada yada, but the idea is that you just need to get the feel for painting

148
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:50,866
landscape, from where you're standing. Obviously,

149
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:54,866
this landscape is too glossy, we can sort that out later. It's reflecting too much sun, it doesn't look like

150
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:58,866
the grass at all because there's no image material in it. We can add

151
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:02,866
images in. It's not a problem, you need to add another node inside the Blueprint Editor,

152
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:06,866
and we'll iterate on the landscape as we go, as I say.

153
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:10,866
The purpose, for now, is just to get something really simple down

154
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:14,866
so that we have a landscape that is a visual metaphor,

155
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:18,866
for the type of landscape that we ultimately are going to want. Now, that may

156
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:22,866
be a photo real landscape, or it may be a really simple landscape,

157
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:26,866
like this one. That's entirely up to you. Now, I think from ground level the tank is not

158
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:30,866
going to be able to see that, so I'm going to come down a bit, using my W, S, A,

159
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,866
and D and just only paint

160
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:38,866
what we're going to be able to see. Now, I'm bound to have left some bits, but that's

161
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:42,866
absolutely fine for now. I'm just going to roll out. I've got one

162
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:46,866
of these mouse wheels. You can click a button, it's a Logitech and you can free the mouse wheel,

163
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:50,866
which is pretty handy. And then, I'm very roughly now with some

164
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:54,866
brush falloff going to just paint the

165
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:58,866
edges of the grass now. Now,

166
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,866
the potential problem with the Brush Falloff is, on the inside of that brush, we're going to get a little bit

167
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:06,866
of dirt color painted, but we can then come along with the

168
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,866
brush with no falloff and then we can sort that out later on.

169
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:14,866
Also, when we're painting with actual textured materials, we're

170
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:18,866
going to have a different type of node in the blueprint, which is going to control something called a

171
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:22,866
UV Map, which you haven't seen yet. And then, that will allow us to be a lot more

172
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:26,866
controlled with this, but for now, this works absolutely fine. So

173
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:30,866
now, I'm going to go to a high tool strength, but no Brush Falloff and a very very large

174
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:34,866
tool and just fill the grass in in the middle, taking out any of those

175
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:38,866
little problems we had with the green. And really, for now,

176
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:42,866
I just want a flat... If you make a mistake, Control Z, by the way. Make a really flat

177
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:46,866
messer, if you like, a table landscape area, so that we can get our

178
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:50,866
tank movement working on a piece of flat ground, without worrying about getting

179
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:54,866
stuck on things, etc. That's good, so were done! Go down to the ground level, have a

180
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:58,866
quick look around. Of course, we're moving relatively slowly because  it is a big terrain, and this has

181
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:02,866
given us a simple visual metaphor of a terrain and that's all we're looking for.

182
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,332
