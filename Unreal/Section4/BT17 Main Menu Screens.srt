1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this video we're going to talk

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
about Main Menu Screens, a really important part of your games, of course!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And by the end of it, you'll have a very rough and ready Main Menu, just an image but that's enough

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,633
for the first one. There's plenty to learn and I'll see you in there!

5
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:19,633
So, it's with some excitement I introduce you to how to make a start menu

6
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:23,633
for your game, because, after all, all games start here! I actually advocate

7
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:27,633
making your start menu pretty early on in the process. So, lots

8
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:31,633
of ways you can do menus in Unreal. In

9
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:35,633
our BattleGround scene, attached to our player controller, we have now

10
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:39,633
got a tiny piece of UI right, that little white dot, and later we'll have the

11
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,633
ammo, etc. And if you wanted a pause screen, then the pause screen

12
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:47,633
would pop up in this window, and it would do that typically

13
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:51,633
by unhiding a piece of UI that was always

14
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,633
there in the first place. So, what I mean by that is, if we look at

15
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:59,633
the PlayerUI, what we might do for a pause screen, for example...

16
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:03,633
Don't do this, I'm just going to give you a bit of an overview. What we might do for a

17
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:07,633
pause screen is have an image, perhaps like this, with maybe a transparent background,

18
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:11,633
and it may say some stuff on it and give us some options. And then, we might

19
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:15,633
hide that element, most of the time, so that the game just shows through,

20
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:19,633
and when we hit pause, we might unhide the element. Alright, so that's a

21
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:23,633
valid way of building up a UI. Now, we could have a single UI across the entire

22
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:27,633
game for the start menu, for the in game, and just hide elements and show

23
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:31,633
elements, but it gets really confusing in the hierarchy of the UI,

24
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,633
amongst other things. So, there are several reasons why it's just

25
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,633
simpler and easier, if we have a separate level for our

26
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,633
start menu. So, that's what we're going to do. We're going to setup a completely

27
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:47,633
independent level. So, let's do that now! File, New Level. I'm going to make it

28
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:51,633
completely empty, so an empty level, and I'm just going to call it

29
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:55,633
Main Menu. Now of course, the way you do that is you try and save it, and it goes well

30
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:59,600
I don't have a name. So, we give it a name, MainMenu.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,633
Perfect! So now, in our _Levels folder, we have a MainMenu.

32
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:07,633
If it wasn't in your levels, of course, you can drag it there very easily. And while we're dragging

33
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:11,633
things, let's drag the TankPlayerController into the Tank folder, moving

34
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:15,633
not copying, and we'll leave the PlayerUI right where it is, just for now.

35
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:19,633
So, we have a main menu. I'm just going to save some changes, and it's completely blank.

36
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:23,633
So, what I want you to do is to actually setup

37
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:27,633
this UI. Don't try and make an entire main menu, I'm going to go through

38
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:31,633
that with you, but I'm going to ask you to just get it showing something. But

39
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:35,633
before you do that, we need to decide which blueprint is going to be responsible for setting this up.

40
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,633
In the case of the tank in the game, it's the PlayerController, because

41
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:43,633
that makes sense right? If your tank dies, you may want to de-possess the tank,

42
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:47,633
come into a spectator view, and still be able to see like your health or your

43
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:51,633
ammo or something. So, it's the PlayerController that seems

44
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,633
to make sense there. Now, in this level, we have nothing but a main menu,

45
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,633
so the logical place for me to put the code that is going to setup

46
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:03,633
the UI is in the level blueprint. So, under the Main

47
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:07,633
Menu, with that selected; make sure you are in MainMenu. Go to Blueprints

48
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:11,633
and Open Level Blueprint. There's already a level

49
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:15,633
blueprint there, we just can't see it. So, this level blueprint is

50
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,633
where we're going to set this up. We're going to get rid of the tick, and in BeginPlay

51
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,633
we're going to do exactly the same magic as we did over on the previous piece of UI,

52
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:27,633
for the aiming reticle. There's a cool name, reticle! And we're just going

53
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:31,633
to show something, just like an image or a button or something. So, that is your challenge actually.

54
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:35,633
So, really revising UI, add a widget from the level blueprint.

55
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,633
Open the MainMenu level blueprint, as I just did. Create a

56
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,633
blueprint to add the widget to the screen. So, make a widget, you haven't even

57
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:47,633
got a UI widget yet. Make a widget blueprint class, just like we did for the player,

58
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:51,600
and then, create some blueprint code to add that to the screen, same

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,566
as we just did. And test it works, by the way, with a button, an image,

60
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:59,566
or just some UI element so you can see that it's working. So, this is going to

61
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:03,566
be a great revision of a UI for you, make sure you understood what we did in the previous video.

62
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:07,566
So, pause the video. Please don't just watch my solution, please take the opportunity

63
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:11,566
to challenge yourself, that's where all the learning happens, and I'll see you in a moment!

64
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:15,566


65
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:19,566
OK, welcome back! Let's make this happen! Arguably the most sensible

66
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:23,533
thing to do first is to actually create ourselves a new piece

67
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:27,533
of UI. So, we have a PlayerUI. What we're going to want now maybe is a

68
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,533
folder called UI. That seems to start to make sense. Put the PlayerUI

69
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:35,566
in it, go into it, and I'm going to

70
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,533
make myself a new User Interface

71
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:43,566
widget blueprint, and I'm going to call it Menu... Ooh, can't

72
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:47,600
type. ...BP. And actually, while we're here, this PlayerUI, it is actually a blueprint,

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,633
so why not rename it. The great thing about anything that's blueprint related is, we

74
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,633
can actually rename without trouble. Of course, C++ classes aren't so

75
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:59,633
forgiving. Just to prove that, let's pop back to the battleground

76
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,633
and play. Make sure

77
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,633
that it still works. It does, good! Alright, so we're at the point now

78
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,633
where we want to actually make ourselves a UI main menu.

79
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:15,633
And we have two tabs, the Designer tab, which is where we're going to put the things down and the Event

80
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,633
Graph. We don't need anything in the graph yet, but we do need to put

81
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:23,633
something down just to prove that this is working. So ultimately, we're going to have a background image

82
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:27,633
here. So, I will take the background image,

83
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:31,633
and pop it on the background like that. That'll do, just a big white blob is pretty

84
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:35,633
obvious, and just compile that. So,

85
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:39,633
now I have a blueprint class, we need to tell something which is the

86
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:43,633
LevelBlueprint here,

87
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:47,633
to the main menu, we need to tell it to construct this widget. So,

88
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:51,633
remember what we do. We create a widget, we choose the class.

89
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:55,633
It's Main Menu blueprint. That's all you need to do there. That spits out a

90
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:59,633
reference to the actual instance of the

91
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,633
Widget class. The widget, you know the User Interface. Now, we

92
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:07,633
Add to Viewport. Why is it up automatically for us? And that should be it.

93
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,633
Let's compile it, play. Ah hah, we have the

94
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:15,633
essence of a main menu! Fantastic!

95
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:19,633
So, now let's start actually configuring up the main menu and have it do something,

96
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:23,633
like have a background image might be a start right.

97
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,633
Well, we're going to get you an image that you can use for the background. Now, the

98
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:31,633
way I found the image that I supply in the course I think is, I just went to

99
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:35,633
I can't remember tank firing or something?

100
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:39,633
There's Google search, I go to Search Tools, I look for...

101
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:43,633
Where did I do this? Images,

102
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:47,633
Search Tools, Usage Rights, "Labeled for reuse with modifications",

103
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:51,633
just to be fairly safe, and here's the tank image itself. So, you could just

104
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:55,633
go and get it from Wikipedia, or you can download it from against this lecture.

105
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:59,633
So, I'm going to download

106
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:03,633
this image. View Image, oops.

107
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:07,633
Just to show you. And you can go and choose any image you like, but obviously, if you're making a commercial game, just be a little

108
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:11,633
bit careful about what you do with that image. There it is! There's the image!

109
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:15,633
And let's pop into the main menu,

110
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:19,633
and let's specify this image. Now, you can't just,

111
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:23,633
by the way, pull the image directly in, because it's not yet imported into

112
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:27,633
Unreal, so it's only going to see assets that are imported. So, to import that

113
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:31,633
image we simply Import to /Game/UI. So, I'm going to

114
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:35,633
my Content Browser, in my UI folder, and you right-click in there and say

115
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:39,633
Import to Game. Then, we can go and find the relevant

116
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:43,633
image, like that, and there it is, we have the

117
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:47,633
image! Great! So now, back in the main menu

118
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,633
blueprint, that image I put on the background, we can then go and

119
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:55,633
specify what the actual image that we're going to be using here is.

120
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:59,633
So, I'm going to call it Background Image, for a start.

121
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:03,633
We'll worry about the anchors and stuff in just a moment. Let's just get the image in to make sure

122
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:07,633
that it is behaving itself. So, can you see in this menu system

123
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:11,633
where we set the image? It's not completely obvious, it's actually under the

124
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:15,633
Brush. We're brushing this box with the image, so you open up the Brush,

125
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:19,633
and now you can go ahead and choose, with that dropdown, the image we imported.

126
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:23,633
Great! There it is! And it's got the Image Size, etc. So, what we need to do now

127
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:27,633
is just get the properties of this image, so that it's behaving itself. We want

128
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:31,633
to think about this image staying in the screen, even if the screen is slightly

129
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:35,633
different in size. We want the image to be nicely centered

130
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,700
in the screen and nicely anchored.

131
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,700
We also need to add some buttons and to also make the mouse

132
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,700
available, when we're in the game, without this hackie Shift F1

133
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,700
that they talk about. You would find that if you actually build this game for Mac

134
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,700
or PC right now that the mouse won't be available. So, there's lots of other things we need

135
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,700
to do. Scaling the image, buttons, mouse, and others. So, let's

136
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,700
make those the subject of future videos, because this one is plenty long enough.

137
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,400
