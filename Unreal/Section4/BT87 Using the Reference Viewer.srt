
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800


2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,800
So hey and welcome to Using the Reference Viewer! The purpose of this video actually is

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,800
to delete our starter content from our project altogether

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,800
and to bring the Starter Content folder out of the .gitignore,

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,800
so that we have all of our starter content type material

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
tracked by source control, when we do choose to use it. So we simply won't have start content at all

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
at the end, and everything in our content will be properly tracked by source control,

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
paving the way for us to use projectiles properly, being sure that we're

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,600
starting from the actual starter content without any modifications. So I'll see you in there!

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,600
So our mission here is to get rid of the Starter Content folder, because it's

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
not currently tracked under source control. Remember in our .gitignore we were

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
ingoring it, and therefore, any changes we make to it are not being tracked and that's dangerous.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,600
I, in particular, have caused a problem, if I just show you. If

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,600
we look in the Starter Content and then we go to particles, this

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
P_Explosion that comes in the starter content, don't worry about how it works

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
for now. But I have edited it offline between videos, and I have

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
added an extra Smoke emitter and that's going to cause problems.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,600
So that's symptomatic of an overall issue that we're not tracking changes in starter

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,600
content. Now we've chosen not to because starter content is large. If you have a

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
look at StarterContent's properties, you'll see that it's 600 megabytes.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
We don't want to put all that under source control, especially as I if I use TreeSize.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,600
You'll see that most of it is textures and most of these we never use. So the skill

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,600
I want to show you is using the Reference Viewer and using Unreal's Reference Checking

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
to work out how we can delete stuff and move stuff, without losing any

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,600
references, anything important. So let's see the process for

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,600
doing that. If we just try and... Firstly, let's backup this

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,600
StarterContent, before we do anything else. So I'd suggest you close Unreal, go to your

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,600
file system, go find your BattleTank folder, and go into

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Content, StarterContent, right-click it, send it to a .zip file,

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
and pop it on your Desktop. I've already done that to save time. And just

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,600
take it completely out of the folder OK, and that way you've got a backup of your StarterContent, because

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,600
remember it's not being tracked under source control. That should make you a little bit nervous.

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm going to close VisualStudio, because it's nothing to do with this video, and let's go back

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
into Unreal, which is somewhere around here.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Here we go! Perfect! So what I'm going to do is get you going on this, show you the

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,600
ideas, a couple of tips and tricks, and then, I'm going to leave it to you to go and manage, to delete your starter content

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,600
folder. So now that we have a backup, we can just try and delete it. Right-click on StarterContent,

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,600
in the Content browser, and Delete. It's not just going to delete it. I know that the

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
ceiling of the sky uses a cube and that the grass is painted on the

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
landscape and there's dirt on the hills, and you may have used other starter content stuff as

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
well, but this system will now go ahead and check for references and dependencies

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
and it'll warn us before it deletes anything, which is quite cool! There you go! So if

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
we start with this, Metal_Rust. I happen to know that that's used by this

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Mortar. So this is the asset that's using the referenced assets,

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,600
and then, the referenced asset, in this case, is the rust. The flat land is going to be

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
using grass and gravel, and then, we've got glass on the ceiling

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
and we have a cube as well on that ceiling.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
And then, I'm not seeing much else in the list. No I think that's it! Well we can get rid of the glass

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
and the cube very easily, because that is all about this sky

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
glass here. We don't need that. If I just delete that from the scene completely,

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
then we should have solved at least those reference issues. Let's go ahead and

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,600
rerun the delete. Before you rerun the delete, you want to be saving everything, just

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
to make sure that it's caught up with you. So go ahead and rerun the delete, and this time it

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
should find less things that are dependent on the StarterContent

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
folder, that's what it's looking for. It's ignoring self references within the Starter

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Content Folder. For instance, if a particle system requires a texture

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,600
and they're both in the StarterContent. That won't be reported here, that's a good thing, that keeps it simple

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
for us. OK, so what do we have now? We have

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Rust, Grass, and Gravel, it seems like they're the only things. Yeah!

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
And between them, they're used on the Mortar, the FlatLand, and the BattleGround.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Let's start with the Mortar, and I'll leave you to do the landscape texture

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
or the landscape or roughness thing and then the BattleGround itself. The general

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
principle is this, let's look at the Rust, for a start!

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's find "rust" within the StarterContent. M_Metal_Rust, there it is! If you

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
right-click it and say Reference Viewer, it will show you

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
not only what depends on rust, so the Mortar and the Starter map, don't

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
care about the Starter map, but the Mortar depends on Rust. And then Rust, what does that

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
depend on? All these things on the right here, there's up to 15 it's rendering, you can choose that here.

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
So the Rust itself depends on all

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
these things. Some of these are in the starter content. These three, the MacroVariation,

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
which makes the rust look different over a larger scale, the color of the rust itself, and then, the normal

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
map, which gives it bumpiness, are all in the StarterContent. So

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
if you want to get all of these out, as well as the asset itself, you right-click and say Find

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,600
in Content Browser. And you go back to your Content Browser and it will have highlighted

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
these textures that Rust depends on. Now you can move those

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
into the Mortar folder. We'd also better move Rust

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
itself. Where is Rust itself? It seems not to be here, but that's probably because I'm looking in the

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,600
wrong folder. There you go, Rust is in the Materials folder. Let's move over to the

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Mortar, too. Great! Now if we go back to the

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Starter Content and look for Rust, it seems to have all gone, which is good news! It's all inside

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,600
the Mortar folder, along with all the other bits. OK, so if we do a Save

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
All, and then, we go ahead and

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,600
try and delete the StarterContent, we should be working through the list now and

84
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
getting rid of things that depend on starter content. Ultimately, as I said, what we'll do once we've

85
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
managed to get rid of starter content is remove it from source control and live a happy life, with

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
everything in our project properly tracked, apart from all the derived files, of course.

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,600
So let's just let this search finish, and then I'll throw you into a challenge!

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
So what have we got? We've just got Grass and Gravel

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,600
now. The Mortar still seems to be dependent upon something.

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Could it be this reference further down the list? Let's have a look! Metal_Rust!

91
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,600
OK, let's just deal with these object redirectors. So there is

92
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,600
one more thing left. Let me show you what happened. When we

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,600
moved the Rust material, from the StarterContent's

94
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Materials folder into the Mortar, this guy here, look what it did. You can't

95
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,600
see it unless you go to Filters, Other Filters,

96
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
and then show Redirectors,

97
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,600
they're like aliases. If you do that you'll find, through a search maybe

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,600
use this, that we have a Rust Redirector in the Materials folder.

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,600
And that was just Unreal's way of making sure that there's a bridge, over to the Rust's

100
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
new location, in case it's needed, but we're trying to get rid of the StarterContent

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
folder. So we can get rid of that redirector like this, right-click the Materials folder and Fix

102
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Up Redirectors. It says that it "Finds references to all redirectors in the selected

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,600
folders and resaves them if possible", and "deletes any redirectors

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
that had all their references fixed." Perfect, so we do that! Now,

105
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
there are not redirectors, which means that if we now try and delete

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,600
starter content... This is a pretty common gotcha, that there redirectors

107
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
can confuse you, and you may not be able to see the redirectors, but remember you turn on the Filters,

108
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Other, Show Redirectors, and then, you get to see those aliases.

109
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Now we're going to do a search again, and we should

110
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,600
only have two assets that depend on anything in there, those two. And it's the Grass and

111
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Gravel and anything that the Grass and Gravel require that we need to

112
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
move out now. And guess what, who's going to do that? You are! So make sure

113
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,600
you've backed up your folder as a .zip file, try deleting your starter content, move all referenced

114
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,600
assets out or delete relevant objects, and then eventually delete the Starter

115
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Content folder, close and reopen the Editor, and test everything works,

116
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
and then, when you've done that, share your nice new tidy folder structure, as an image

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,600
or some other how, in our discussions over on the community site and I'll see you in a minute.

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,600


119
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,600
OK welcome back! So I am going to just observe this. I think it's Grass and Gravel

120
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,600
are the only things left, so I'm going to go and find Grass and Gravel

121
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,600
inside the StarterContent. Let's start with the Grass! M

122
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,600
_Ground_Grass. There are actually three things. Now the

123
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Ground_Grass is the thing in question, I think, or was it the texture?

124
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Hmm, good question, I will just go back and have a look. I don't remember

125
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,600
which type of grass it was. If these searches take a long time, you could

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,600
always use something like SnagIt, a screen capture tool, to grab

127
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,600
the result of the search, and then, go in one big pass through, deal with everything

128
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600
and then only run the search infrequently, because it's quite a slow dependency search.

129
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
So I could come here with SnagIt, I have a keyboard shortcut for that.

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
And have I got SnagIt open somewhere? I should have.

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,600
And I can come and snapshot that, and then I can see exactly that it's T_Ground

132
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
_Gras and T_Ground_Gravel, it's the textures. So we start

133
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,600
from T_Ground_Grass. We look at the Reference Viewer for that and we see

134
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,600
what it depends on. Well ostensibly it doesn't depend on anything. That's interesting!

135
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,600
So I should...

136
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,600
T_Ground_Grass_D, I'm not trusting that entirely. What are the references

137
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
for the others? Grass, yeah Grass depends on all

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,600
this stuff, you see, in the StarterContent. If you're going to use

139
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Grass, which we have been doing as a material on our

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,600
landscape we're going to need to take all this stuff with it, the Perlin_Noise, the MacroVariation, and all that.

141
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,600
So again, we can find it in the Content Browser, move all this stuff into the BattleGround

142
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,600
folder, and then, I'm going to go back to my

143
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
screenshot, if I can find it in here, and see what else we had. We also had

144
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
the Gravel, so I'm going to look for Gravel.

145
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
T_Ground_Gravel, I'm going to look at its references.

146
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Let's try the other one.

147
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Yeah, I think most of them have gone across, so I just

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
need to move both bits that relate to the Gravel into

149
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,600
the BattleGround folder. And that should be

150
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
pretty much it! Let's go ahead and save everything, rerun the deletion

151
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
script, and see if we've got all

152
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
our dependencies out of the StarterContent folder. It'll be a big sigh of relief when we have, we can

153
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,600
finally finally get rid of it, close Unreal, remove it from source control,

154
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
and we'll be happy happy bunnies in the safety of no more mess-ups, due to changes

155
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,600
in starter content. So we still have some things,

156
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
both on the FlatLand asset. What have we got? T_Ground_Gravel_D. OK, it's just object

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,600
redirectors. All of these problems now are redirectors, so we can right-

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
click, fix up redirectors in folder. I think that will do it recursively,

159
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,600
through the subfolders, I think I saw it do it just then. So now, if I delete the

160
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
starter content, finally with the redirectors gone, we should be in a

161
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
position where we have not starter content and all of our stuff is nicely

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,600
put away with the assets that need them, like the Rust with the Mortar,

163
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
etc. Now you may want to separate your assets out differently, as your project gets bigger,

164
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,600
but this is a great start! Yeah, this is the thing we want to get to, Pending Deleted

165
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Assets. So let's delete all that! So I'm loading

166
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,600
everything, deleting it, and no more folder that's

167
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
talking about starter content. Great! I'm going to get rid of this filter. I'm going

168
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
to do what I suggested you do, which is close and then reopen the Editor.

169
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Then, I've got a tiny bit of source control work to do and then we are done!

170
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,600
So I reopen the Editor. Now has starter content come back? It has!

171
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,600
So what i'm going to do is, just close the Editor, go to Content, and delete off the disk

172
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,600
the StarterContent folder, and then, reload Unreal.

173
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,600
You need to do that with Unreal closed,

174
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
and there, it is no longer there. It's all very well it no longer being there. Don't

175
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,600
celebrate yet, make sure that your game runs. [Laughs] I deleted a folder! Oh, I broke my game!

176
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Not so clever. So everything appears to be OK, and we've done it quite

177
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
carefully. That's good news! So close Unreal, close VisualStudio.

178
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Let's open up our .gitignore file. Now there are two .gitignore files in my project,

179
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,600
anyway one's at the root here of the project, and that has in it

180
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,600
a couple of things, it has BattleTank.VC.VC.opendb and

181
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
the .vs folder, so let's keep that on the left. And if I go

182
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
into BattleTank, I've got another .gitignore, which is the one we're going to keep, which has all this stuff in it.

183
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
But it doesn't have the BattleTank.VC.VC.opendb, so I'm going to move that

184
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,600
into there, and I'm going to move the .vs/, so we ignore

185
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,600
everything in the hidden .vs folder, like that. I'm going to save this

186
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,600
.gitignore on the right, so I've just added those things. I'm also going to get rid of the

187
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,600
StarterContent removal at the bottom. So what we're doing in our main

188
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
.gitignore is, we're consolidating two .gitignore files together, and we are

189
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,600
making it start tracking starter content and we're putting these things in,

190
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
so that we can delete this other .gitignore. Let's just

191
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,600
save it all, and I'll show you the changes, because .gitignores themselves, of course, are subject

192
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,600
to version control. Let's have a look at what the changes are, after I stage all this.

193
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,600
The following things are 10

194
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,600
megabytes or larger. That's OK I'm going to live with that, I don't think they're too huge.

195
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm going to stage the .gitignore, and then, you can see the changes I made to the

196
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,600
.gitignore. The one in

197
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,600
the BattleTank folder has just had these two things added to it

198
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,600
and the StarterContent taken out, and the .gitignore, that's in the top level here, I'm going to

199
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,600
delete because I don't need it. I only want one .gitignore. Some instances you

200
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,600
want more than one, in this case I don't. So when this catch's up, it should notice that I

201
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,600
deleted the other .gitignore. There it is! Stage that deletion and we're good to

202
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,600
go! So we've deleted a .gitignore, moved a bunch of assets. They look like pluses

203
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
in here, because they've come under folders that are now tracked by source control.

204
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,600
We've modified that main .gitignore and we are in a good

205
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,600
position here. So let's go ahead, commit our work, and carry on with

206
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,600
starter content properly tracked under source control!

207
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:44,933
