00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. let's talk

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
about the Tank Control System! In this video. we're going to have a bit of an overview of what's

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
going on. We're going to talk about how we're going to support keyboard. mouse. and the gamepad

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
controller. We'll be talking about mapping player intentions. to control

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
inputs. Mapping control inputs to actor actuators. Actuators

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is a bold sounding thing. Really we're just rotating actors or moving actors.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And we'll be introducing the content of "fly by wire". so let's just start talking

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
through it. Basically. as part of this iterative cycle. we've had a go on the World. there's a huge amount

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
more we could do a landscape. but we're done enough for now. So next. we're going to do.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
look at these three steps kind of all in one. the Tank. the Controls. and Player 2.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We need to come up with a control paradigm that obviously

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
moves the tank. and we need to think about the different components of the tank. We then

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
need to come up with some controls that make sense. and then. we need to.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
at the same time. think about how Player 2 whether that Player 2 is a human

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or an AI would actually control the tank. So. that's what we're going to look at now. Later. we'll

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
go back through User Interface and then back round to the World. This cycle is not a particularly

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
set in stone cycle. it's just something that we're just following for this particular section.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So. control inputs! Keyboard and mouse. as I said. and Xbox controller is what we're going

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to be using for this section. You don't need to have one. If you've got one. great! An Xbox 360

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
controller should plug directly into the USB port of your PC and work without any troubles.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You can also use other types of controllers. if you wish. We are

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
going to be assuming. for this section. that we have a couple of analog triggers on the controller.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but as I said. it's not essential. you can still use and test this game without it. So. let's

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
look at the major tank components. There are three major components to consider in a tank. and

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
they all can move somewhat independently. You've got the white base. which is the tank body. Of course.

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
there's two tracks on that. it can move forward and backwards and rotate. Of course. it

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
can't strafe. Then. we've got the blue. The blue is the turret

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and that is going to contain people's head and

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
hold onto the barrel. and then. of course the barrel there in red. which can elevate up and

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
down. So the turret. the blue can rotate. the tank can translate and rotate. but it

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
can't strafe sideways. and then the turret's up and down. So. pretty obvious stuff.

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but just want to be clear on there. they're the major components we're dealing with. So. what I want to

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
do is start talking about the control system. Now. I'm sorry that I can't animate this table how

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I would like to. on Google Slides. but I'm just going to take it from the top-left onwards.

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Firstly. let's get the layout of the table. We're talking about the control intentions. the intention

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of the Player or the AI or the 2nd Player. Then. we're going to talk about what

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
would happen in a Manual Control Paradigm. then fly by wire.

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now. fly by wire. what that means will kind of come clear at the bottom of the table. In

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
simple terms. its Manual Control is where you directly actuate something.

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
like you move a track forward or back. where fly by wire is you set an intention like

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I want to rotate the tank. and then. maybe one track goes forward and the other goes back or whatever.

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So. that's basically what fly by wire means. And then. we'll also be clear on what

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the actuators are. the things that are actually going to be moved. So. starting with the first

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
movement forward. If we want to go forward. we're symmetric on the triggers. I'm assuming that the two triggers

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
of your controller here are... And by triggers. by the way. I mean back

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
here. the two little things sticking out of the top of that diagram. the actual left and

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
right trigger and they're analog. So. if we were symmetric with our triggers.

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
then we would be sending both tracks forward at the same speed. I'm assuming that the left

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
trigger drives the left track and the right trigger drives the right track. and the degree to which

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
you pull the trigger determines how fast the tracks move. because I think this is going to be quite a fun

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
direct control system for the tank. So. one option would be. you pull the triggers in symmetrically and

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
then you go straight forward. If one triggers in more than the other. of course. you'll be turning to one side.

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But the fly by wire control could be the left stick

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
going forward. to indicate I just want to move forward. or you could use the

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
W key on the keyboard and then you would move forward at a constant speed. In the case of the left

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
stick. of course. it would be an analog stick so it's an analog speed.

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So. let's think about backwards! Backwards again. we could use the bumpers. and what are the bumpers? Well. on the controller

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
they are these things just above. So the triggers are the little guys sticking out here. the bumpers are the ones

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
slightly closer to us in the foreground. They're actually digital. they are on or off. So.

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
what we could do with the bumpers is we could say that the bumpers put the breaks on if we're moving forward.

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and then. immediately send us into a fixed speed reverse once we've stopped. That would be good

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
enough. So. symmetric bumpers would make us break or go backwards.

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and also. we could use the left stick or the S key. so I'm going for a standard W. S. A.

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
D. as indicated on this picture of the keyboard over here.

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
OK. so that's an indication of the sort of controls. What I would like

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you to do. as a challenge. is to really think through these controls. because it's a very valuable exercise

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
before we go diving in and actually making this happen. we want to know what control

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
paradigm we're ending up with. So I want you to complete the control

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
table. I'll flip back to the slide in a minute. but let me just brief you on it. I want you to finish

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
the control intention table. There is no wrong way or right way of doing this. the purpose is for you to think

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
through this. We want fly by wire controls

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.033
only on the keyboard and mouse. so think about how we could use the keyboard

73
00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:52.800
and mouse in a less direct way. because we really don't have enough analog axes on the keyboard and mouse.

74
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.633
So. maybe play a tank game. World of Tanks or War Thunder or something like that.

75
00:04:56.633 --> 00:05:00.633
and maybe follow the control system in those. And then. with

76
00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:04.633
the controller. we want manual control and potentially fly by

77
00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:08.633
wire. so we just want more of a manual control element as an option on the control.

78
00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:12.633
as I started to show you. So look. really there's no right answer here. as I

79
00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:16.633
said. I want you to sit down and think about how control inputs would relate

80
00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:20.633
to outputs. So. we go back to this table. and I want you to just finish it

81
00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:24.633
off. Add another three. four. five rows to this table. as many as you see fit.

82
00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:28.633
and spend about 15 to 20 minutes researching another tank game and really just get into the

83
00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:32.633
mindset of thinking about how controls might work and the consistency of it

84
00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:36.633
and how it all kind of fits together. So go ahead. pause the video. and do that now.

85
00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:40.633


86
00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:44.633
So welcome back! Here's the challenge slide! Now. there's going to be a face full of new lines in this table

87
00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:48.633
here. so we're going to work through it one at a time. and I'll use my mouse cursor to try and help you see

88
00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:52.633
through this. So. boom loads of stuff! Let's go down to Strafe.

89
00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:56.633
Strafe is the next thing. Well that's moving sideways. it's just not applicable to a tank. I don't know if you've

90
00:05:56.633 --> 00:06:00.633
seen the new A Team Film with B. A. Baracus. when he says "You can't fly a tank fool!"?

91
00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:04.633
[Laughs] Well. you can't strafe a tank fool either. so it's not going to happen. We're not going

92
00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:08.633
sideways in a tank. so we can forget that. But rotating the body. how would you do that? Well. you'd use

93
00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:12.633
asymmetric triggers or bumpers on the manual controller. or you'd simply use the left stick

94
00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:16.633
left or right. if we're going for fly by wire control on the controller or the A

95
00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:20.633
or D keys would be another way of doing that. and that would rotate

96
00:06:20.633 --> 00:06:24.633
tracks. different speeds. So. that's the actuator! What we're saying here is

97
00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:28.633
that the actuator is the tracks. and in order to cause a rotation. they just need to move at

98
00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:32.633
different speeds. Any different speeds and it will rotate. how different the speed is determines how fast it rotates.

99
00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:36.633
So let's move down to rotating the turret! Well. I'm thinking

100
00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:40.633
we'll deal with these two together. rotating the turret and elevating the barrel. so

101
00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:44.600
aiming is a shortcut for those two. I'm thinking we don't bother giving manual control

102
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.066
in the controller for that. It's too much hassle really. while you're trying to think about driving a tank as well. So we'll go for pure fly by wire

103
00:06:50.066 --> 00:06:52.633
just like the controls in War Thunder. but what you do

104
00:06:52.633 --> 00:06:56.633
is you look into a particular direction. the camera goes immediately

105
00:06:56.633 --> 00:07:00.633
to the direction with right stick or the mouse. and then shortly afterwards the barrel

106
00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:04.633
follows to that position. so both the elevation and the rotation

107
00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:08.633
move to that position after some time. they're limited in their speed. And

108
00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:12.633
the things you're actuating are the Turret Rotator and the Barrel Elevator. so it's

109
00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:16.633
pretty simple. So hopefully that gives you an overview of what we're trying to achieve with the tank

110
00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:20.633
controls here. it's pretty much as simple as that. What we're going to do next is dive in and start actually

111
00:07:20.633 --> 00:07:24.633
putting a very basic block-work tank together. and then. we'll start thinking about

112
00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:28.633
how we control this thing both in C++ and with a little bit of Blueprint where it makes

113
00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:32.233
our life easier. So. see you there!
