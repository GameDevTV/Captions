00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000


2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So welcome to Using Clamp() to Limit Values! In this we're going to learn how to make

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
our barrel actually move up and down. and furthermore. make it only move up and down

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.800
as much as we want it to. as a pass through the tank or point bolt upright. So see you in there!

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.800
OK guys. we can finally get this barrel on the move. So

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.800
firstly. this magic number here about the Elevation. I'm going to keep a magic number. but

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.800
I'm going to start off with it being 1. i.e. 100% of its speed. Then.

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.800
we're going to make sure that it actually does move at about

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.800
20 degrees per second. That's too fast isn't it? Let's go for

10
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.800
a little bit of a lower speed. I'll do that in the tank blueprint.

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.800
because 20 degrees per second is only going to take 2 seconds. we're not going to be able to see what's

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800
going on. So. let's go down to say 5 degrees per second for testing. Now. I'm

13
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.800
doing this in the blueprint because I want to override the C++ value. I think that

14
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
20 degrees per second is perfectly reasonable as a default. but I think that 5 for testing

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.800
here makes more sense. OK. so we're going to call this method

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.800
with a value of 1 in the TankAiming

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.800
component there. which means 100% of your maximum speed. It's

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.800
still a magic number. it still needs to be tied through to what's coming out of here. but for now. let's just

19
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.800
use it for testing. So. let's go ahead and actually get this tank barrel elevating

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.800
and making sure that if we pass in a relative speed more or than one or less than -1

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.800
that it still only goes at the maximum speed. So. how are we

22
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.800
going to do that? Well. let's just get on with it! I'm going to talk about there being an Elevation

23
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.800
Change. in this particular

24
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.800
frame. And that's going to be how much? Well it's going to be the RelativeSpeed

25
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.800
times the MaxDegreesPerSecond. So at

26
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.800
this point. we've got a number in degrees per second. but of course. if we have something

27
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.800
per second and this is an ElevationChange at this frame. that's too long a

28
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.800
variable name for me to use. but you get the idea. Everything's this frame in the game. basically.

29
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.800
Then. we need to go get the world. And then. do you remember the method?

30
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.800
What am I looking for for the world? What am I doing here. rather than just watching

31
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800
me? Have a think about it? How am I going to correct this to make sure that it's framerate

32
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.800
independent? Well. it's DeltaTime

33
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.800
Seconds. and that is a property. so no prackity things.

34
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
OK. so that's the elevation change that we need in this frame. hopefully that makes sense

35
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.800
to you. It's RelativeSpeed was 0. we'd get 0 out here. If it's 1 we'll get Max

36
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.800
DegreesPerSecond and everything in between. Alright.

37
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.800
so the next thing is. we need to think about what the unclamped

38
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.800
new elevation would be. so we can call it. Or Raw if you like.

39
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.800
RawNewElevation. And this is saying. well if we weren't

40
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800
concerned about the fact that there's a maximum and a minimum possible elevation.

41
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.800
then the calculation would be really simple. It would be simply the Relative

42
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.800
Rotation of the barrel. dot Pitch...

43
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.800
Ooh. if I can spell properly! Now. RelativeRotation

44
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.800
is a property here of this scene component.

45
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.800
dot Pitch. and if we were just to take that

46
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.800
and add the Elevation change that we just calculated. whether it be

47
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.800
positive or negative. then we would have some new elevation. But imagine

48
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.800
that the current pitch of the barrel is 20 degrees and that this Elevation

49
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
Change works out more than that. and...

50
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.800
Well actually. let's use some real figures. say the. What have we got? MaxElevation of 40.

51
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.800
Alright. so imagine that the current barrel is just under 40. but this Elevation

52
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800
Change would take it above 40. What's going to happen? Well. the barrel's going to exceed its Maximum

53
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.600
Elevation right. so we need to clamp to make sure that can't happen.

54
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.600
Now. before we go on to talk about how to clamp this Elevation. let's show the problem.

55
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.600
So. let's go ahead and Set the Relative

56
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.600
Rotation() of the barrel. and we're going to give

57
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.600
it a new (FRotator) and we're going to construct that with the

58
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.600
Elevation or the (RawNewElevation)) for now.

59
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.600
And 0 and 0 for yaw and roll.

60
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.600
OK. and close as many brackets as we opened. Cool!

61
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.600
So. hopefully this makes sense. We work out what the ElevationChange is. We work out what the New

62
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600
Elevation would be. given the current Elevation plus the ElevationChange. You could

63
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600
put this in an intermediate variable but I'd think that's a bit much. and then. you pass it

64
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600
straight to the barrel. Let's see if this works! Let's go ahead and compile

65
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.600
our code. and then. let's see

66
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.600
what happens. Hopefully if the tank... Make sure your tank is saved. by the way.

67
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.600
and that you've got a MaxDegreesPerSecond in the Barrel of say 5. so that it moves at a

68
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.600
testable speed. Let's have a look! Oh cool. look at this! Now. watch the barrel. let's

69
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600
notice when it stops! 6. 7.

70
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.600
8. 9. [Laughs]... OK. so

71
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.600
this is why we need to clamp the barrel elevation right. So. it should have stopped after 8

72
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.600
seconds. I think. because we had 40 degrees MaxElevation. and

73
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.600
it's gone all the way to vertical. It doesn't go past vertical. and that's

74
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.600
because we've hit the maximum possible rotator pitch

75
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.600
value. You can. in principle. pitch further. but this rotator won't pitch any

76
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.600
further. That's fine for the barrel. it's got plenty of range for the barrel. we don't want to even go that

77
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.600
high. If you look at the Barrel and you look at the parameters.

78
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.600
we set a Max Elevation of 40 and a Min of 0. so therefore. it

79
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.600
had 40 degrees to travel through. 5 degrees per second. It should have taken 8 seconds. it should have stopped

80
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.600
at 40 degrees and it didn't. so that is what we need to sort out next.

81
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.600
But you've done plenty of watching me write code and not very much writing

82
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.600
code without my help. so guess what's coming. It's challenge

83
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.600
time! I want you to clamp the elevation! You're going to use a method called

84
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.600
FMath::Clamp(). Now why is it colon colon? A couple of videos ago I

85
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.600
did something with a colon colon. that's a static method. Static methods

86
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.600
basically are things that are completely functional. it means that this method is going to

87
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.600
spit out a return value and not mutate or change anything. so it's pretty

88
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.600
easy to use. The IDE will tell you what it takes in and what it returns.

89
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.600
and you can also have a look online to see different

90
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.600
signatures and different ways of using this. There is a generics format

91
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.600
with chevrons. you know the angle brackets. But. take a look

92
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.600
online or use the IDE to work out how FMath::Clamp() works. and then. test that

93
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.600
you have indeed restricted your elevation in between the two parameters we set in the

94
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600
header file. the Max and Min Elevation. OK. see you in a moment!

95
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.600


96
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.600
OK. so let's clamp this puppy! So auto...

97
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.600
I'm just going to call it Elevation. rather than anything more

98
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.600
complicated. I'm going to take Elevation off here. because we're going to be passing it through.

99
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.600
We're going to go FMath::Clamp() and it's going to

100
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600
take a few things. Now look at this signature carefully! It's got a

101
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.600
generic template here. which means that you can tell it to work on a particular type.

102
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.600
So that's what's happening in the angle brackets there. We could tell it

103
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.600
the type of thing we want to clamp. Why don't we do that just for fun!

104
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.600
I'm going to say let's operate on <float> very explicitly. Then. the first

105
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.600
parameter is going to be the thing that you want to clamp. which is the (Raw

106
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.600
NewElevation). The next parameter is the Minimum. which is the

107
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.600
MinElevationDegrees and the other one is the Max

108
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600
ElevationDegrees.

109
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.600
Where's that going? Let's take a look! MaxElevation

110
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.600
Degrees. well it's there so I'm going to ignore IntelliSense. because it

111
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.600
hasn't caught up. bless it. And I am just going to assume that this is going

112
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.600
to work. because I think I've used that method properly. Ah you don't have to put the float there. but in doing

113
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600
so. I'm telling it to explicitly work on floats.

114
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.600
Alright. let's have a go!

115
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.600
If you don't do that. you may get some implicit type conversions. where something is converted from an int to

116
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.600
a float or whatever. and I prefer to be specific about what we're trying to do. Let's have a go!

117
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.600
So now. when we look at it from the side. I'm hoping that in the console. if you keep your eye on that. when that hits

118
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.600
8 seconds the barrel will stop moving. I'm also hoping that if we.

119
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.600
ah nice. that if we depossess the tank with F8 now and then have a look

120
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.600
at this tank. and then. if we were to inspect it.

121
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.600
which we could do through the World Outliner. we may be able to get

122
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.600
to the actual barrel inside that tank. We're going to need a bit of messing around.

123
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.600
over here in the Details tab and let's click on Barrel. And here you go. Rotation

124
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.600
39.999 near as...

125
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.600
40 degrees. So it's worked! On the up side. it's very likely to

126
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600
work on the down side. but why don't we just try it anyway?

127
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.600
One way you could do that would be to go to your Tank Viewport. to go ahead

128
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.600
and rotate your tank Barrel's default position up to. it doesn't matter. say

129
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.600
30. and then. in your calling method. instead of Tank

130
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.600
AimingComponent saying Elevate. it could say depress. i.e. -1.

131
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.600
OK. so we're going to go from 30 degrees downwards to 0. Let's see if that works!

132
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.600
Then. all we've got to do is remove our magic number. and we are

133
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.600
golden. we'll have an Elevation working! So

134
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.600
there it goes! Down down down! I think I said 30 degrees. didn't I?

135
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
So it should take 6 seconds there and it stops at 0. Perfect!

136
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.600
Clamped barrel movement. that's what we like! So. I'm just going to put my barrel back.

137
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.600
I think a default of 0 looks good. I think that 5 degrees per second

138
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.600
actually is probably not far off now. So. I'm

139
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.600
going to push that default back to the code in the TankBarrle.h.

140
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.600
because actually 20 was a bad guess. And it's fine to make a bad

141
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.600
guess. but once you get better evidence. then come back and fix that default. A Max of 40

142
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.600
and a Min of 0. I think that's perfectly reasonable. I think it would be nice to get our turret to

143
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.600
say 45 degrees. Let's check that visually. make sure that doesn't look crazy.

144
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.600
Yeah. I think it will look crazy actually. so I'm going to stick with the 40.

145
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.600
And now. I'm going to make sure this barrel actually has

146
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.600
0 pitch. in the beginning. That's cool! And I actually think that a bit of negative pitch should

147
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.600
be possible. but the question is. is that possible on the back of the tank? And I

148
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.600
think it isn't. I think that if this turret was facing the other way.

149
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.600
we wouldn't be able to go any lower. I've already moved these barrels down a little bit on the model.

150
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.600
No. so it's going to have to be a range of something like 0 to 40 or it just

151
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.600
ain't going to make any sense. it ain't going to work. OK fantastic! So there's

152
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.600
the settings. after all that discussion. 5 degrees per second. 40. and 0. It's going to compile up

153
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.600
that blueprint. The final thing we need to do here is say. well this is all very

154
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.600
well. how about two more things? How about if I was to call Elevate with a value.

155
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.600
instead of 1 I say that 5 that we had before. Let's just

156
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.600
try that! What should happen is that the 5 will come in as a

157
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.600
RelativeSpeed. The Tank barrel will go RelativeSpeed 5. That's fine!

158
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.600
It'll come in here and actually it'll go wrong. at the moment.

159
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.600
because what's going to happen is the RelativeSpeed is going to multiply

160
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.600
up these DegreesPerSecond and it's going to move 5 times too fast. Let's see it doing that!

161
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.600
There you go. far too fast. OK. and if I called that with a... Do you want to

162
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.600
just see it again to prove it? It should take 8 seconds. it's taking just 2. under

163
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.600
2 seconds. So what we need to do is we need to clamp that Relative

164
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.600
Speed here. Now. we can just mutate RelativeSpeed. in this case.

165
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.600
if we want. which means you just change it.

166
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.600
So. why don't you go ahead and do that. As a little micro challenge. why don't you clamp a Relative

167
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.600
Speed to between -1 and +1.

168
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.600
Well. go on then. I'm not going to do it till you've tried. OK. so

169
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.600
RelativeSpeed = FMath::Clamp

170
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.600
I'm going to tell it that I want to work on a >float>

171
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.600
and that it's the (RelativeSpeed)

172
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.600
...-1

173
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.600
+1. OK. very explicit. Now. I said that FMath::

174
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.600
Clamp doesn't mutate anything. That's true. it spits out an answer without changing the state of

175
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.600
anything but then. if we assign RelativeSpeed back over the top of itself.

176
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.600
like this. so the result of this function called. assigned over the top of RelativeSpeed. then

177
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.600
RelativeSpeed here on line 12 is different to what it was when it came into the method.

178
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.600
That's cool! I think that we can leave the comments. I think they're not

179
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.600
doing any harm. We need to just check now that this works. with a

180
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.600
relative speed call of 5 in the

181
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.600
parameters. It should not move any faster than it originally did. Now

182
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.600
it should take 8 seconds to fully erect to 40 degrees. Here it goes. looks

183
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.600
good! And we've clamped that RelativeSpeed! That is fantastic!

184
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.600
Alright. so the final thing we need to do to get this Elevation working is. of course. tie it

185
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:24.200
up in the TankAimingComponent. We don't want this magic number in here. We just want to know

186
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.200
how much to move this Barrel by. and that amount is this DeltaRotator that we worked

187
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.200
out a few videos ago. which is the change in

188
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.200
Elevation that we need this frame. according to the TankAimingComponent. dot

189
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.200
Pitch. And we don't really care if that value is above or below 1. because it's

190
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.200
going to be clamped inside the TankBarrel

191
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.966
method. so. or class rather. So. let's go ahead and run this now.

192
00:12:48.966 --> 00:12:52.966
What I'm hoping is that just pitch will just work.

193
00:12:52.966 --> 00:12:57.000
Lots of justs in there. Now. we're going to have to look at it carefully to see if it is working.

194
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
if it compiles. It does! Let me go F11 so we can get full screen.

195
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Alright. so what's happening here? If I point. say there. is that a reasonable

196
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
pitch? Forget the yaw. it's not going to work. so I'll aim just in front to save confusion.

197
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.966
So. it's feasible that it's pointing in the right direction. and then. you get to a

198
00:13:12.966 --> 00:13:16.933
certain distance and the projectile is not going fast enough to get there. so it doesn't even

199
00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:20.966
bother calculating. So. you could try this with a different

200
00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:24.933
projectile launch velocity. just to convince yourself that it's probably

201
00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:28.900
working OK. So. you can come into the Tank...

202
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.900
Where do we set this launch speed? If I get a launch speed of 8.000.

203
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.933
should be able to hit those far mountains now. So. if I now aim up...

204
00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:40.933
You see it aiming up? I'll F11 it so you can see a bit better.

205
00:13:40.933 --> 00:13:44.933
There you go. it's now aiming up into the distance. It's going to hit that hill. and then. you aim

206
00:13:44.933 --> 00:13:48.933
above the hill. it no longer gets a solution. it resets to neutral. How about this right-

207
00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:52.933
hand hill here? You can see it being very sensitive now to the height

208
00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:56.900
up the hill. So I think it's working! Off the top of the hill. it doesn't solve and returns to

209
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.900
neutral. So. I think that Elevation is probably working. We'll know for sure when we start doing

210
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.933
rotation. and then. we start actually spitting out some projectiles and seeing their

211
00:14:04.933 --> 00:14:08.933
path and everything will be much clearer. So. hopefully that made sense as to what we've

212
00:14:08.933 --> 00:14:12.900
done there. We've sent the Pitch in. and then. we've processed it in here.

213
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.933
And yeah. I'll see you in the next video!

214
00:14:16.933 --> 00:14:18.266
