
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this video we're going to be

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
getting the Player Controller using C++. By the end of it

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we'll have the simple but important result that, when we play the game we have say three AI

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
tanks in the world, and if we look at the logs, we'll see that all three of them are finding us

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
as a PlayerController. And we'll understand that from the context of this

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
diagram which I will build up for you, which explains how Levels, World Actors

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
PlayerController instances, Game Modes, and stuff all relate together. [Laughs]

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,733
So, I will see you in the video!

9
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:34,733
So guys, what we want to do now is to implement this bit, on

10
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:38,733
the left. We have both the Tank AI Controller

11
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:42,733
and the Tank Player Controller, finding the Tank and reporting that their

12
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:46,733
possessing the relevant tank. Now we want to get to the bit where we can actually send a message

13
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:50,733
through to the tank to aim at the player. So, let's take a look

14
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:54,733
at what that involves. Firstly, we need to understand how we're going to find the PlayerController,

15
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:58,733
that is the Tank on this diagram on the

16
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:02,733
left at the top, needs an AI tank, so it needs to find

17
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:06,733
the Player Tank. In this case, there's only one Player Tank, but there could be more than one, so

18
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,733
let's work it through. A World or Level, which aren't exactly the same thing, but for now,

19
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:14,733
let's consider them to be the same thing, has one or more Actors in it like that.

20
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:18,733
And those Actors may be tanks, they may be, I don't know,

21
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:22,733
lights anything. They could be anything inside the

22
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:26,733
world, a barrel, it could be a chest, it could be anything.

23
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:30,733
Alright, but some of those Actors are actually a PlayerControllers

24
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:34,733
as well, are also Actors, and of course, the tanks are Actors.

25
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:38,733
So what we've got is, this world that's got a lot of Actors in it, for now that's

26
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:42,733
just three tanks, all of which are Pawns, all of which are specialized

27
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:46,733
to be tanks, and we have one PlayerController instance. We

28
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:50,733
could have many, which is why I've drawn it like that with a stack, though it's at the moment , we only

29
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:54,733
have one PlayerController. It's not a multiplayer game, it's a single human player multi

30
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:58,733
AI player game. OK, so there are going to be

31
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:02,733
multiple AI Controllers but only one PlayerController. So that's

32
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:06,733
the instance we're in, we have one PlayerController, which is possessing one of the

33
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:10,733
Actors, tanks, and then, the other tanks are possessed by something else which we're not concerned

34
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:14,733
about here, which is the AI Controller. So, how do they end up? How do these PlayerControllers

35
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:18,733
end up in the World? What happens, on construction, is that the

36
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:22,733
World or Level specifies a Game Mode, which we've done, I think we've done it in

37
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:26,733
Blueprint, and then that Game Mode specifies either a PlayerController C++

38
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:30,733
class or a PlayerController blueprint class. And in our case, we

39
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,733
will end up with both, one parented on the other, which in turn

40
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:38,733
instantiates the PlayerController instances as necessary. So it's important to

41
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:42,733
remember that's the kind of sequence of events that goes on, so that we know how to find

42
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:46,733
our PlayerController. And if we couldn't find our PlayerController, for some reason, you'd know to come back to this

43
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,733
slide and look at and work it through methodically to work out why.

44
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:54,733
Alright cool! So, now we've got this far, let's go ahead and open our

45
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:58,733
TankAIController C++ class, and we're going to write another

46
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:02,733
method, which is GetPlayerTank(). So

47
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:06,733
we got GetControlledTank() and BeginPlay(). By the way, by default these things are private.

48
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:10,733
Despite what I said in a previous video, they're private: by default, and

49
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:14,733
so we may as well explicitly say that. And let's write a new method which is ATank* pointer

50
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:18,733
GetPlayerTank();

51
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:22,733


52
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:26,733
And it's going to return its constant, because it's not going to change anything. It's going to return a

53
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:30,733
pointer to the player tank. So that's what we want to go and implement! Let's go ahead and

54
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:34,733
write the implementation of that now! So,

55
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:38,733
use basically the same signature with, of course, the class name.

56
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:42,733


57
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:46,733
Perfect! OK, so how are we going to get the player

58
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:50,733
tank? Well, there's a couple of different methods you can actually use for this,

59
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:54,733
and I want you to have a look on the web and see if you can work out how to do it.

60
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:58,733
I'm going to suggest that there'll be two things you'll find. You'll see a game play statics,

61
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:02,733
when you do a Google Search; you'll also see this method here, so if you haven't got an Internet connection or you don't

62
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:06,733
want to look it up yourself that's the method we need. Once you've got the First Player Controller

63
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:10,733
like that, I want you to protect your pointer because maybe it'll fail, and then, maybe cast it

64
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:14,733
to a Tank and then log out on BeginPlay() to check it worked.

65
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:18,733
So, you actually can replace the code that currently says, I'm possessing

66
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:22,733
a tank, and you could say, instead of that, using the same if structure in the BeginPlay()

67
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:26,733
we could say either I have or I haven't found a Player Tank.

68
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,733
So, rather than this AI Controller reporting what tank it's possessing, it's going to report

69
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:34,733
something very different, which is which is the Player Tank, Player 0 as a hint for you,

70
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,733
which is Player 0 in the game, the first Player Controller. Alright, so

71
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:42,733
good luck and I'll see you in a minute! See if you can get that done.

72
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,733
If you're struggling, as a recap

73
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:50,733
we're just trying to get the AI Tanks to find and report

74
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:54,733
which tank is the Player Tank.

75
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:58,733
OK cool, so welcome back! How are we going to get this Player Tank then? So, well

76
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,733
let's start off with auto PlayerTank = and

77
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:06,733
we'll go for this GetWorld() method, and then it's a pointer

78
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:10,733
so we need to use the arrow operator -> GetFirstPlayer

79
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:14,733
Controller(); Now, inteli-sense has not caught up with me yet but that should

80
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:18,733
be fine. So that gets us the PlayerController, and from the Player

81
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:22,733
Controller we want to get the Pawn,

82
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:26,733
i.e. we know that we are Player 0, we are controlling that tank that's in the foreground,

83
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:30,733
we want to get the Pawn of that. Now, if not

84
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:34,733
(PlayerPawn). We should call it (PlayerPawn), not PlayerTank, because that's what it is.

85
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:38,733
Then, what do we want to do? We want

86
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:42,733
to get out of here, before we try and cast it.

87
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:46,733
We get out of here by returning null pointer, because this method that we're in returns a pointer,

88
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:50,733
it expects a pointer coming back to a tank, but if it succeeds we'll get

89
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:54,733
this far. Then we'll return a Cast, if you remember that, to a type of

90
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:58,733
<ATank> and it's the (PlayerPawn)

91
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,733
that we are casting. OK, so that should,

92
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:06,733
if we have properly declared this. Why TankAIController?

93
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,733
ATankAIController, that's the problem! It should all fall into place now! Great!

94
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,733
Then, what I'm saying up here, instead of getting controlled tank, we're going to get

95
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:18,733
PlayerTank. So, PlayerTank

96
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:22,733
and then we'll just replace this stuff GetPlayerTank(); if

97
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:26,733
not player tank, report ( "AIController

98
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:30,733
can't find player tank")); AI controller can't find player tank

99
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:34,733
But if we do manage to find the player tank, then we say the

100
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:38,733
player tank is ("AIController

101
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:42,733
found player: %s") that'll do, and instead of

102
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:46,733
ControlledTank it's PlayerTank name. You see what we're doing there? So, we're going and getting the PlayerTank

103
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,733
and then reporting out what's going on. Let's try this! Before we do, before we

104
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:54,733
even try and run it, let's check all this is setup right! So, is the World or Level

105
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:58,733
has it got the right Game Mode set? So, you go to Blueprints,

106
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:02,733
BattleTankGameMode blueprint for this world,

107
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:06,733
and what does it specify as a PlayerController? The PlayerController blueprint great.

108
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:10,733
So from our diagram, that's this specifying a blueprint class

109
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:14,733
which actually is in itself, if we look at the class...

110
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:18,733
Do we have a blueprint? Let me have a look. Yeah, the blueprint class

111
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:22,733
is based on our TankPlayerController C++ class, which is flashing away over here.

112
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,733
So, we've got exactly this situation, it's that that should be spawning the PlayerController instance.

113
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:32,766
So hopefully this'll work! Let's play the game and see if we get what we're looking for!

114
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:36,766
So, we seem to have the AIController, can't find the

115
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:40,766
PlayerTank. Well why not? I don't know if you're getting this problem,

116
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:44,766
you may not be. I'm not sure why I'm getting it, so let's follow the logic through. Let's

117
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:48,766
go look at our code and see what may or may not be happening over there.

118
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:55,400
So, ("AIController can't find player tank"). We're getting to here, which means that we're seeing a not PlayerTank. So, if

119
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,933
ah look! I've missed the exclamation mark in front of (PlayerPawn). I was not saying if not PlayerTank, I was just

120
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:05,966
I was just saying if PlayerTank returned null pointer, so this was succeeding, and then, we're

121
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:09,966
returning a null pointer which was coming up here and dropping through to here.

122
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:14,000
I think that's what's happened. Let's see if that's what's happened![Laughs] What a pain!

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,033
Let's just take a look. So, those semicolons are subtle and they're small, but

124
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:22,033
they can totally invert the behavior of your game. Ah, cool! Look!

125
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:26,000
The AIControllers, both of the AIControllers for the AITanks found player

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,966
BP_C_38. Let's just de-possess the tank, go to the

127
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:34,000
World Outliner, and check that that is indeed this tank. It is! Success! So

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,033
The tanks can actually find the player now, and that's great news!

129
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:42,000
And if we were to drop a third tank into the world, just for laughs,

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and play, then we would have three of them all finding the same player! So that's pretty

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
cool! Congratulations on getting that far! I'm just going to leave you with this diagram

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,966
to remind you of the architecture. Take a little look at that, make sure it makes sense and that you know where the

133
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,966
checkboxes and buttons are inside the engine, and remember to commit your work,

134
00:08:57,966 --> 00:09:01,966
over in the source control, as I have been for every single video. And

135
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,999
I will see you soon!
