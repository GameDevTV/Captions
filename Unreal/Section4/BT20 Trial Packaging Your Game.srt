Hi and welcome to Trial

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Packaging Your Game! What we're going to be doing this video is actually making a Windows executable

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
here. which is going to run independent of the Editor altogether. and you'll have an

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
actual app here that you can rescale and move around. And crucially you'll

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
be able to start it. this was me hitting on the control pad. move the camera around.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then. quit. all just from the control pad. which is

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.700
great! Or keyboard and mouse if you want. but the point is. there's a complete game loop available. Let's dive in and see how that works!

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.700
OK. so the first place to start is to make sure that in our Settings and

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.700
Project Settings. that we actually under Maps and Modes. have the

10
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.700
Game Default Map set correctly to the main menu. because that's where we want to start.

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.700
I think I'm going to set my Editor Startup Map to the

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.700
BattleGround. actually. just to show the difference. So. the

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.700
Editor Default Map is the following. If I close Unreal altogether and then

14
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.700
reopen it. then what's going to happen is. because I set the Editor Default Map

15
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.700
to the BattleGround that's where we're going to end up. which is fine for building this game. Most of the action happens

16
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.700
here. When we play. we'll also be playing straight from the battleground. but

17
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.700
when we build the game. and that's what I'm going to want you to do in this video. you can either do

18
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.700
it with me or you can wait until the challenge in a minute and do it for yourself. What we're doing to do is.

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.700
we're going to package the project rather for. in this case. a Windows

20
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.700
for me. a 64-bit Windows. and I'm going to pop it in my Downloads

21
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.700
folder and just let Unreal go ahead and package this. So. we're actually going to be making

22
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.700
a stand alone game here that we can run. so almost a shippable

23
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.700
game. not quite. Quit a lot more to do. So. if we just watch in Downloads

24
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.700
what comes in. let's see what actually happens because it's quite interesting

25
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.700
to see what it actually produces. It's not currently

26
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.700
appearing in Downloads. for some reason. Maybe it hasn't refreshed? Here you go! So. you'll find

27
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.700
yourself a folder called a WindowsNoEditor. It's still building but there's a folder called WindowsNoEditor.

28
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.700
And what have you go in there? Well. let's look at the size of these things. Actually. let's use

29
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.700
TreeSize. a useful little utility I have installed. TreeSize Free.

30
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.700
there we go! So. most of it goes in this BattleTank folder 655

31
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.700
megabytes. In the Content and then in a Pak. it makes this Content Pak.

32
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.700
which contains all the assets basically. There are the Binaries

33
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.700
as well. which there has an .exe in it. and then. you've also got

34
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.700
an Engine folder which includes the parts of the engine that you need for this game

35
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.700
to run. So. all in all you end up with this lot. and what

36
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.700
you want to run is this top-level BattleTank.exe. And

37
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.700
with any luck it'll go to the start menu. or the main menu as we call it.

38
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.700
because that is where we decided to go. If you check the scaling. then this is all

39
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.700
working. Then. we start the game. Now. the scaling. by the way. in the game we haven't

40
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.700
really thought about. but so far it's working fine because it's just rendering a 3D scene.

41
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.700
so the scaling will work. And that's it. so you can close the app

42
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.700
by either hitting the Escape key...

43
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.700
Is that working? Let me try again. let me run it.

44
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.700
start. and then. I'm going to try the Escape key. No. the back key on the

45
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.700
gamepad is also not working. OK. so we need to sort that out. because I did

46
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.700
want a way of getting out of the game. Let me make sure. before I go and sort that out. that we can get into

47
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.700
the game. so I'm going to push A on the gamepad now. Yeah. so A is working

48
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.700
but the back button isn't. So. let's go see what's wrong. There's something simple

49
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.700
in the Project Settings. Let's start at the beginning. Input. Quit.

50
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.700
It's either the Escape key or the Gamepad Special Left. Great! So.

51
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.700
now what we need to do is make sure that in the level blueprint for this.

52
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.700
we actually have an InputAction on

53
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.700
Quit. Yeah. InputAction Quit. we Quit the Game.

54
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.700
Yeah. the Quit Preference is Quit. so that should be working. Let's

55
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.700
try it from here. from the preview. I'm going to hit Escape and it does stop.

56
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.700
I'm also going to hit the back button on the controller and it does stop. so I'm not sure

57
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.700
now why it's not stopping when we packaged for the

58
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.700
windows. Let's just try repackaging. Sometimes it can be

59
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.700
a little bit quirky like this. We just want to make sure that we have a fully

60
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.700
playable standalone game for this video. that's the purpose. I just want you

61
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.700
to get used to packaging really early for testing. because even though the Editor is supposed

62
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.700
to preview precisely what the game would be like. when it's running on the target machine. you

63
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.700
can't be sure that it's doing that perfectly all the time. It's a very good practice to

64
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.700
regularly package and check. and this just seems like a good time to do it. especially

65
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.700
because we're dealing with esoteric things like. you know. bindings

66
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.700
of these controls and exit conditions. So. let's try running again!

67
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.700
I'm picking up my gamepad. I'm pushing the A button. we're going into the game.

68
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.700
I'm going to push the back button now. and it's still not quitting.

69
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.266
Nope OK. so we still need to do some work!

70
00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:43.266
Now. this is a slightly strange error. and I believe the reason for it is as

71
00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:47.266
follows. Let's try! If we start in the MainMenu here

72
00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:51.266
and we run the game and I hit A and then

73
00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:55.266
I check that I can move. Ah you see I can't control the tank. whereas

74
00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:59.266
if I start playing directly from the battleground. then I can control

75
00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:03.266
the tank. and that's because the input mode has defaulted to game only.

76
00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:07.266
The problem is this. in the MainMenu blueprint when

77
00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:11.266
we setup. in the beginning once the widget is ready. we set the Input Mode to UI only.

78
00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:15.266
but when we hit the start menu and go ahead and open BattleGround. we

79
00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:19.266
still have the Input Mode in UI only. so it's persisting through.

80
00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:23.266
So there's lots of places we could change this. but I think here is a good place to do it. because it's right

81
00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:27.266
next to where we set it. So. if you go to your Main Menu blueprint.

82
00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:31.266
in the Event Graph. and there's a Set Input Mode

83
00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:35.266
to Game Only node. Let's set that. So. what we're

84
00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:39.266
saying is. if we hit the start button.

85
00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:43.266
then what we want to do is we want to open the BattleGround level. and then set the

86
00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:47.266
Input Mode to Game Only. for the Player Controller. It's a bit ugly

87
00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:51.266
this but it's fine. In fact. if we move things around a little bit. we can prevent

88
00:05:51.266 --> 00:05:55.266
crossing. which always makes things a little bit clearer. OK. so we're saying that

89
00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:59.266
once we've opened the BattleGround level. set the Input Mode to Game Only. Let's see what

90
00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:03.266
that does. It'll only take effect if you start the game from the main menu.

91
00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:07.266
Play the game. we hit A on the controller. we test that we have

92
00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:11.266
control. which we do. We may want to give the player an inverted Y axis later option later. but

93
00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:15.266
for now. that's fine. and then. I hit the back button on the controller and the game quits. That's

94
00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:19.266
great! So the final check is to make sure this actually works in a Windows 64

95
00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:23.266
build. so I'll just go ahead and just do the build. And that's

96
00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:27.266
that! So the problem was that the Input Mode propagated from the menu outwards.

97
00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:31.266
so we fixed that right at the source by saying. well as soon as you leave go ahead and change

98
00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:35.266
the Input Mode back. Alright. so let's just wait for the package to finish.

99
00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:39.266
test it out. and then we'll be taking it from there. So. let's go ahead

100
00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:43.233
and run and have a final test. Start.

101
00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:47.266
control works. back button works. and that's all without

102
00:06:47.266 --> 00:06:51.266
touching the keyboard or mouse! Fantastic! So. if you haven't done it already. I want you to

103
00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:55.266
package for your operating system. set the Editor and Game startup maps. build for your

104
00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:59.266
platform. and test that it runs well. Try rescaling the menu. try the gamepad

105
00:06:59.266 --> 00:07:03.266
only. see if you can get in and out of the game with just the gamepad. Of course. you'll have to double-

106
00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:07.266
click it to launch it in the first place. and I'll see you in the next video.

107
00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:07.999

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi and welcome to Trial

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Packaging Your Game! What we're going to be doing this video is actually making a Windows executable

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
be able to start it, this was me hitting on the control pad, move the camera around,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then, quit, all just from the control pad, which is

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,700
great! Or keyboard and mouse if you want, but the point is, there's a complete game loop available. Let's dive in and see how that works!

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,700
OK, so the first place to start is to make sure that in our Settings and

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,700
Project Settings, that we actually under Maps and Modes. have the

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,700
Game Default Map set correctly to the main menu, because that's where we want to start.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,700
I think I'm going to set my Editor Startup Map to the

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,700
BattleGround, actually, just to show the difference. So, the

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,700
Editor Default Map is the following. If I close Unreal altogether and then

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,700
reopen it, then what's going to happen is, because I set the Editor Default Map

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,700
to the BattleGround that's where we're going to end up, which is fine for building this game. Most of the action happens

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,700
here. When we play, we'll also be playing straight from the battleground, but

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,700
when we build the game, and that's what I'm going to want you to do in this video, you can either do

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,700
it with me or you can wait until the challenge in a minute and do it for yourself. What we're doing to do is,

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,700
we're going to package the project rather for, in this case, a Windows

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,700
for me, a 64-bit Windows, and I'm going to pop it in my Downloads

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,700
folder and just let Unreal go ahead and package this. So, we're actually going to be making

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,700
a stand alone game here that we can run, so almost a shippable

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,700
game, not quite. Quit a lot more to do. So, if we just watch in Downloads

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,700
what comes in, let's see what actually happens because it's quite interesting

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,700
to see what it actually produces. It's not currently

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,700
appearing in Downloads, for some reason. Maybe it hasn't refreshed? Here you go! So, you'll find

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,700
yourself a folder called a WindowsNoEditor. It's still building but there's a folder called WindowsNoEditor.

28
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,700
And what have you go in there? Well, let's look at the size of these things. Actually, let's use

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,700
TreeSize, a useful little utility I have installed. TreeSize Free,

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,700
there we go! So, most of it goes in this BattleTank folder 655

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,700
megabytes. In the Content and then in a Pak, it makes this Content Pak,

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,700
which contains all the assets basically. There are the Binaries

33
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,700
as well, which there has an .exe in it, and then, you've also got

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,700
an Engine folder which includes the parts of the engine that you need for this game

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,700
to run. So, all in all you end up with this lot, and what

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,700
you want to run is this top-level BattleTank.exe. And

37
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,700
with any luck it'll go to the start menu, or the main menu as we call it,

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,700
because that is where we decided to go. If you check the scaling, then this is all

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,700
working. Then, we start the game. Now, the scaling, by the way, in the game we haven't

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,700
really thought about, but so far it's working fine because it's just rendering a 3D scene,

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,700
so the scaling will work. And that's it, so you can close the app

42
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,700
by either hitting the Escape key...

43
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Is that working? Let me try again, let me run it,

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,700
start, and then, I'm going to try the Escape key. No, the back key on the

45
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,700
gamepad is also not working. OK, so we need to sort that out, because I did

46
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,700
want a way of getting out of the game. Let me make sure, before I go and sort that out, that we can get into

47
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,700
the game, so I'm going to push A on the gamepad now. Yeah, so A is working

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,700
but the back button isn't. So, let's go see what's wrong. There's something simple

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,700
in the Project Settings. Let's start at the beginning, Input, Quit.

50
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,700
It's either the Escape key or the Gamepad Special Left. Great! So,

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,700
now what we need to do is make sure that in the level blueprint for this,

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,700
we actually have an InputAction on

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Quit. Yeah, InputAction Quit, we Quit the Game.

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Yeah, the Quit Preference is Quit, so that should be working. Let's

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,700
try it from here, from the preview. I'm going to hit Escape and it does stop.

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,700
I'm also going to hit the back button on the controller and it does stop, so I'm not sure

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,700
now why it's not stopping when we packaged for the

58
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,700
windows. Let's just try repackaging. Sometimes it can be

59
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,700
a little bit quirky like this. We just want to make sure that we have a fully

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,700
playable standalone game for this video, that's the purpose. I just want you

61
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,700
to get used to packaging really early for testing, because even though the Editor is supposed

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,700
to preview precisely what the game would be like, when it's running on the target machine, you

63
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,700
can't be sure that it's doing that perfectly all the time. It's a very good practice to

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,700
regularly package and check, and this just seems like a good time to do it, especially

65
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,700
because we're dealing with esoteric things like, you know, bindings

66
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,700
of these controls and exit conditions. So, let's try running again!

67
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I'm picking up my gamepad, I'm pushing the A button, we're going into the game,

68
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,700
I'm going to push the back button now, and it's still not quitting.

69
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,266
Nope OK, so we still need to do some work!

70
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:43,266
Now, this is a slightly strange error, and I believe the reason for it is as

71
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:47,266
follows. Let's try! If we start in the MainMenu here

72
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:51,266
and we run the game and I hit A and then

73
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:55,266
I check that I can move. Ah you see I can't control the tank, whereas

74
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:59,266
if I start playing directly from the battleground, then I can control

75
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:03,266
the tank, and that's because the input mode has defaulted to game only.

76
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:07,266
The problem is this, in the MainMenu blueprint when

77
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:11,266
we setup, in the beginning once the widget is ready, we set the Input Mode to UI only,

78
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:15,266
but when we hit the start menu and go ahead and open BattleGround, we

79
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:19,266
still have the Input Mode in UI only, so it's persisting through.

80
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:23,266
So there's lots of places we could change this, but I think here is a good place to do it, because it's right

81
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:27,266
next to where we set it. So, if you go to your Main Menu blueprint,

82
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:31,266
in the Event Graph, and there's a Set Input Mode

83
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:35,266
to Game Only node. Let's set that. So, what we're

84
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:39,266
saying is, if we hit the start button,

85
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:43,266
then what we want to do is we want to open the BattleGround level, and then set the

86
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:47,266
Input Mode to Game Only, for the Player Controller. It's a bit ugly

87
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:51,266
this but it's fine. In fact, if we move things around a little bit, we can prevent

88
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:55,266
crossing, which always makes things a little bit clearer. OK, so we're saying that

89
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:59,266
once we've opened the BattleGround level, set the Input Mode to Game Only. Let's see what

90
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:03,266
that does. It'll only take effect if you start the game from the main menu.

91
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:07,266
Play the game, we hit A on the controller, we test that we have

92
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:11,266
control, which we do. We may want to give the player an inverted Y axis later option later, but

93
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:15,266
for now, that's fine, and then, I hit the back button on the controller and the game quits. That's

94
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:19,266
great! So the final check is to make sure this actually works in a Windows 64

95
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:23,266
build, so I'll just go ahead and just do the build. And that's

96
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:27,266
that! So the problem was that the Input Mode propagated from the menu outwards,

97
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:31,266
so we fixed that right at the source by saying, well as soon as you leave go ahead and change

98
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,266
the Input Mode back. Alright, so let's just wait for the package to finish,

99
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:39,266
test it out, and then we'll be taking it from there. So, let's go ahead

100
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:43,233
and run and have a final test. Start,

101
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:47,266
control works, back button works, and that's all without

102
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:51,266
touching the keyboard or mouse! Fantastic! So, if you haven't done it already, I want you to

103
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:55,266
package for your operating system, set the Editor and Game startup maps, build for your

104
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:59,266
platform, and test that it runs well. Try rescaling the menu, try the gamepad

105
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:03,266
only, see if you can get in and out of the game with just the gamepad. Of course, you'll have to double-

106
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:07,266
click it to launch it in the first place, and I'll see you in the next video.

107
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:07,999
