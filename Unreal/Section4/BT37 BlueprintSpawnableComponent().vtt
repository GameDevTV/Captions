00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
BlueprintSpawnableComponent()! In this video we're going to find out how to make our

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
barrel class actually available as a custom component.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You'll find that right now it isn't, but TankBarrel will become available, using a new annotation.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then, on that TankBarrel we are going to set some parameters, Max

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Degrees Per Second, how fast it can move, and how high and how low it can move,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.533
so that the barrel doesn't collide with the tank as we move it up and down. So see you in there!

8
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:33.533
So I know there seems to be a lot of hurdles to getting this

9
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.533
tank barrel working but they're wonderfully informative hurdles. We've got another big one for you

10
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:41.533
in this video. So, we want to just add a private property here,

11
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.533
and that is an (EditAnywhere) so that

12
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.533
we can edit some properties of the barrel. Let's just make the variable, that's just going to be called float, the

13
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:53.533
first one for the moment. MaxDegrees per

14
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:57.533
second. Putting a sensible default in, = 20; and I'll just

15
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:01.533
label that as a "// Sensible default", as

16
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:05.533
that's what it is. OK, so anyway, we have

17
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:09.533
made ourselves a UPROPERTY. We would like to be able to set a default degrees per second, when a designer

18
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:13.533
puts a new barrel in the game. They can obviously modify that, but where are they going to edit it?

19
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:17.533
Well, let's compile our code, and then, have a think about where you'd see

20
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:21.533
it. It's not going to be on the tank barrel fbx, because that is a static mesh.

21
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.533
Where it's going to be is inside the Tank blueprint. We

22
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:29.533
have a barrel, but this barrel is not the one. In fact, our very blueprint's not

23
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:33.533
compiling right. Now look, we get a warning, and the warning, if we try and compile

24
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:37.533
is it's having the same problem with tank barrels and static references,

25
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:41.533
meshes rather. This SetBarrelReference method

26
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:45.533
now wants an actual tank barrel, whereas what we've got here

27
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:49.533
is a static mesh. We got it from over here and it's a static

28
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:53.533
mesh component. So the question comes, how do we swap this

29
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:57.533
guy out from being a (Static Mesh Component) Barrel

30
00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:01.533
to being an actual class based thing? Well,

31
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:05.533
that's interesting question. If we try and add a component, look let's go down to the

32
00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:09.533
custom section. What have we got? The only thing we've got at the moment that we've

33
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:13.533
created is Tank Aiming; we have not got our tank barrel. So if we

34
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.533
look at our classes, over in the Content Outliner, the C++

35
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.533
BattleTank, we have TankAimingComponent there!

36
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:25.533
Is available because it's a component, but TankBarrel is also

37
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.533
a component, it's a StaticMeshComponent rather than an actor

38
00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:33.533
component but it is not by default available to this blueprint. We

39
00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:37.533
can't add it. So our mission here is to make sure that TankBarrel appears

40
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:41.533
in the Custom section, here near TankAiming. So how do we do that?

41
00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:45.533
Well, let's go look at the TankAimingComponent!

42
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:49.533
And you see it, by the way, you notice how Unreal in the list under

43
00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:53.533
Custom here in the blueprint, it's taken away the word component which is pretty cool,

44
00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:57.533
and it's also

45
00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:01.533
picked up this forward declaration comment. So, let's go look at the

46
00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:05.533
code for the TankAimingComponent. It's picked up forward declaration here,

47
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:09.533
because it's the first thing before the class. So, what I'm going to do is must move forward

48
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:13.533
declaration here, and I can make use of the fact I know that it's  now

49
00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:17.533
going to read this comment here, just to introduce the class. So, we can say,

50
00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:21.533
"// Holds parameters

51
00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:25.533
for barrel's"...

52
00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:29.533
Well, holds barrel's properties, basically.

53
00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:33.533


54
00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:37.533
..."and Elevate method". Maybe that's

55
00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:41.533
too specific because this'll go out of date, but what I want to show you is, if we compile that,

56
00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:45.533
that the comment will come across...

57
00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:49.533
...

58
00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:53.533
here when we get to Custom and our

59
00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.533
TankAiming. It says HOTRELOADED, so

60
00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:01.533
maybe  that's just saying that you need to reload it down again.

61
00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:05.533
"Holds barrel's properties and

62
00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:09.533
Elevate method". OK, so you've learned a couple of things there as an aside, which is that you want to put

63
00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:13.533
your annotation, that's going to come in the

64
00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:17.533
hover-over, right here. But look, what we're really interested in is that the TankAimingComponent

65
00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:21.533
has this annotation in front of it. Let's compare that to TankBarrel.

66
00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:25.533
It has UCLASS() nothing. This guy has UCLASS, and then, ClassGroup=

67
00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:29.533
(Custom), meta=(BlueprintSpawnable

68
00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:33.533
Component) ). Ah, now that's interesting! So, let's take that stuff and

69
00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:37.533
stick it in the front of the TankBarrel. In fact, let's get rid of the (ClassGroup=

70
00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:41.533
(Custom), for the moment, and see if it works with just UCLASS (Blueprint

71
00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:45.533
SpawnableComponent)). What I'm hoping is going to happen, when we compile this, is

72
00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:49.533
it's thing going to allow us to actually add a TankBarrel type here

73
00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:53.533
under our Custom components. It may pop into this list,

74
00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:57.533
when the compile finishes. It may moan about HOTRELOAD. Let's see when this

75
00:04:57.533 --> 00:05:01.533
list is populated. Here you go!

76
00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:05.533
Tank Barrel, we now have a Tank Barrel available. Let's add it!

77
00:05:05.533 --> 00:05:09.533
Put it where the other barrel is, name it...

78
00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:13.533
Well actually, I'll leave it for the moment but misspelled is fine as long

79
00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:17.533
as I can differentiate the two. Let's go pick a static mesh.

80
00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:21.533
Compare it to the other barrel for a minute, just flick back and

81
00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:25.533
forth. OK, that's cool! And the only thing that's different, look is Tank Barrel,

82
00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:29.533
Max Degrees Per Second. So, rather than Tank

83
00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:33.533
Barrel being the category, we probably want that to be something like setup.

84
00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:37.533


85
00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:41.533
And what's happened is that this annotation has allowed us to add it to the blueprint, so let's delete

86
00:05:41.533 --> 00:05:45.533
the old Barrel now. Just remove the component.

87
00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:49.533
Get this one named properly.

88
00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:53.533
Fantastic! Now, that's named right! Now we can

89
00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:57.533
bring in a reference to what is now, if we hover over it, a

90
00:05:57.533 --> 00:06:01.533
actual tank Barrel type. Bring that into Barrel to set

91
00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:05.533
and compile and we should be getting on much better. Let me just

92
00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:09.533
recompile all the code, because that way our Barrel, when we

93
00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:13.533
go into it, will have instead of it saying

94
00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:17.533
Tank Barrel it's section down here, by adding in the code this category called

95
00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:21.533
setup, this will move into a Setup section,

96
00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:25.533
which is now here. Setup Max Degrees Per Second there, with that sensible

97
00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:29.533
default. Isn't that cool?! So, that is where we're going to be able to put our

98
00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:33.533
details. Now, you might ask yourself, do you want a designer to be able to

99
00:06:33.533 --> 00:06:37.533
actually change things like Physics Properties and Collision Properties on this?

100
00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:41.533
Well, you can hide these properties, if you want to, on

101
00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:45.533
the Barrel. So for example, say we want to hide Collision properties,

102
00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:49.533
this is how you do it. Right up here where we said (meta = (Blueprint

103
00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:53.533
SpawnableComponent)) we can say another keyword that I'm going to show you, which is hide

104
00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:57.533
categories =

105
00:06:57.533 --> 00:07:01.533
and then you give that end brackets. So we need two closed brackets,

106
00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:05.533
a string which is ("Collision")) there

107
00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:09.533
which is the name of this category. Now, let's try recompiling

108
00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:13.533
and see what happens to the Collision category! So, what we're going to do here

109
00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:17.533
is strip down anything that having available in the blueprint

110
00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:21.533
could make the designer break the interaction. So, I'm just using Collision as an example

111
00:07:21.533 --> 00:07:25.533
for now, and you see that now we still have,

112
00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:29.533
under Barrel, Setup, but we don't have Collision anymore.

113
00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:33.533
That's pretty cool right! So you can customize, like that, by hiding

114
00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:37.533
categories. So there's loads of details there about how (BlueprintSpawnableComponent) works!

115
00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:41.533
What I want to do, to finish this video, is to just get the rest of these UPROPERTIES laid

116
00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:45.533
out, and I want you to do that, it's going to be a really simple challenge for you.

117
00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:49.533
So, I want you to add the remaining properties. Add a maximum and a minimum

118
00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:53.533
elevation in degrees, as well as the Maximum Degrees Per Second that we've

119
00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:57.533
already got sitting there. Give sensible defaults in C++. Check

120
00:07:57.533 --> 00:08:01.533
and see how high and low the barrel can go, especially when facing backwards, without hitting the tank,

121
00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:05.533
and then, as I said, prevent self collision and make sure that all those

122
00:08:05.533 --> 00:08:09.533
properties also come through to the blueprint. So go ahead, add the remaining properties we're going to need for the

123
00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:13.533
barrel now, and I'll see you in a moment.

124
00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:17.533
OK welcome back! So let's just

125
00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:21.533
copy this guy. I'm going to get rid of the word "// Sensible default", it was just a suggestion for you guys.

126
00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:25.533
OK, I'm going to get a couple of these down now. So, we need

127
00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:29.533
a MaxElevation

128
00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:33.533
Degrees, is what I'm going to call mine, and I don't know how

129
00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:37.533
many that needs to be yet, so I shall say 0

130
00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:41.533
and 0. I'll find out in Blueprint

131
00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:45.533
and then I'll come and set it over here in the C++. So, I'm

132
00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:49.533
going to set these sensible defaults, and then, we have Min

133
00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:53.533
ElevationDegrees here as well. I don't really know what

134
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:57.533
those Max and Min are going to be. In fact, I'll probably find out,

135
00:08:57.533 --> 00:09:01.533
pretty easily, by just going to the Tank, Viewport. So, the reason

136
00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:05.533
the Barrel is on the floor is, the Parent Socket needs to be set to be set to the Barrel Socket on the Turret, and

137
00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:09.533
the location of the Barrel needs to be reset. Great! So now the Barrel is in the

138
00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:13.533
right place again. Let's have a look at some sensible defaults. I'm going to rotate

139
00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:17.533
it around 180 degrees and, or 170. 180 is better!

140
00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:21.533
Oh no, not that! Not the Barrel rotated 180 degrees, of course,

141
00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:25.533
but the Turret. How silly of me. So how low can

142
00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:29.533
you go, Mr. Barrel? Well, you can go to 0!

143
00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:33.533
You're not going to be able to go any lower than 0, you're going to hit the back of the tank, and if you are facing forward...

144
00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:37.533
Again I'm rotating the wrong thing, make sure you rotate

145
00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:41.533
the Turret here in the Viewport of the blueprint. Grab the barrel, now

146
00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:45.533
let's see how high it can go without looking stupid.

147
00:09:45.533 --> 00:09:49.533
Maybe 40 degrees in a real push. So, I'm going to say between 0

148
00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:53.533
and 40 degrees, as my sensible default. Now, the designer can tweak those further,

149
00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:57.533
but that's what I'm just going to start with. So, let's go put that in the C++!

150
00:09:57.533 --> 00:10:01.533
MaxElevation 40, MinElevation 0,

151
00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:05.533
and get rid of those // TODOs! You say, why do I bother with the TODOs? Just because I was going to move away from the code,

152
00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:09.533
I want to make sure I don't forget to do that. If you ever think I musn't forget too,

153
00:10:09.533 --> 00:10:13.533
do something about it right there and then. Put a TODO in, don't leave a

154
00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:17.533
I must do hanging around, because you won't do what you must do

155
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:21.533
I'm pretty sure. [Laughs] OK, let's compile away, and take a look

156
00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:25.533
at the Tank blueprint here and this Barrel component. What we're hoping is, under the Setup

157
00:10:25.533 --> 00:10:29.533
section, we'll get two new parameters come in, and then, we are done for this video!

158
00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:33.533
It disappeared off the screen but there you go, Max Degrees Per Second, Max Elevation,

159
00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:37.533
Min Elevation in degrees, all very clear! Let's compile the blueprint! That worked!

160
00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:41.533
I'm going to save everything here and close. I'm going to close

161
00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:45.533
VisualStudio, just to be sure, and then, I am going to make

162
00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:49.533
a commit over here in the source control, using the name of

163
00:10:49.533 --> 00:10:53.533
the current video, which is the way I always do that. But I'll leave that off screen, because that'll

164
00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:56.699
bore you. So see you soon!
