00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello hello hello

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and welcome to Adding a Quit Button! In this video

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we are going to, guess what we're going to do it's pretty obvious, we're going to add a Quit

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Button! Here it is Quit, and it will just stop the game! We're also going to fix a

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
bug, which we've previously had, that if you click Start the tanks are all flying off

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,933
and that's no longer happening. We're also going to simplify our collision system a lot. So see you in there!

7
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:30,933
So guys, we have tanks firing, we have problems with our

8
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:34,933
game, but we are making progress! We can shoot at them, they can shoot at us. We can't move

9
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,933
yet but let's stick to our plan, which we decided in the beginning

10
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,933
or I decided in the beginning, that we were going to work on the World, then the Tank, then the Controls,

11
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:46,933
then Player 2, then UI, before looping

12
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,933
back to the World and the Tank and the Controls. So let's do that! Let's go to UI

13
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:54,933
next, just for the sake of sticking to our original plan. The

14
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,933
idea is, we don't dwell for too long on any one area of the game,

15
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,933
before moving on and making sure that we have dealt with any major omissions.

16
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:06,933
So there are a couple of major omissions, that's omissions

17
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,933
o double m [Laughs] for the none English speakers. One is if we go to the main

18
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,933
menu, firstly, we can't quit the game. There's no quit button, which is going to be a pain.

19
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:18,933
And secondly, look what happens when we start the game! Oh dear, where have my tanks

20
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:22,933
gone?! Let's do that again just because it's fun! If we play the game,

21
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,933
Alt P, Start, boom and we have

22
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:30,933
a Serious Flying Tank Syndrome. But interestingly, we don't have

23
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,933
Serious Flying Tank Syndrome, SFTS

24
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:38,933
I think... Yes, SFTS! We don't have that syndrome here, when we play

25
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:42,933
in here. Now why not? Well you're welcome to pause and try and fix it yourself,

26
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:46,933
or I can tell you what's going on, what I believe's going on. I believe what's going on

27
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:50,933
is another one of these self collision issues. Basically, we're worrying...

28
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:54,933
We're running up against issues with Unreal because it's designed for making humanoid

29
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:58,933
characters and skeletal meshes, and we have got ourselves a clunky

30
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:04,166
tank here, with lots of different collision meshes on it all interfering with one another.

31
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,166
So what can we do to prevent this mess-up? Well, if we look at

32
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:12,166
our tank, at the moment, it's got a lot of different parts to it, as I say, and they've

33
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,166
all got their own separate colliders. There's no easy way, that I can see here

34
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:20,166
in this view, to see them. But as I say, you can go to the Game View and you

35
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:24,166
can go to the Battle Ground, play the game, F8 to de-possess,

36
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:28,166
Show, Collision, and you'll see there's a lot of collision meshes,

37
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:32,166
all on this thing, and some of them are inside each other and interacting with each other.

38
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:36,166
And now, I believe we've already turned off the collision on the

39
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:40,166
turret here, but we still have collision on the barrel. No we don't,

40
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,166
we've got rid of it there as well. What else have we got? Tracks!

41
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:48,166
Ah, now the tracks have still got colliders on them! Let me, for a minute, try removing

42
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:52,166
collision from the tracks. Save the game. So go to your track mesh,

43
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:56,166
remove collision from it, make sure there are not collision meshes on it, and now try playing

44
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:00,166
the game from the start menu. Let's see if that works!

45
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:04,166
Because I believe what's happening is, the tracks are effectively exploding off the tanks.

46
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:08,166
Ah, now they're OK, but we sit funny on the ground because our tracks

47
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:12,166
don't have a collider on them, so then if you look carefully at my tank, it's wheels

48
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:16,166
are going through the ground. So look, one simple

49
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:20,166
solution to this, right now, is to just

50
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:24,166
simplify completely this tank's collision properties.

51
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,166
So what we can do is, we can actually take the colliders off the tracks, as well.

52
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,166
Collision, remove...

53
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:36,166
Well I have, sorry excuse me! brain fart there. I removed them a moment ago!

54
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:40,166
But the other thing that has collision on it is the tank body,

55
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:44,166
and we could actually remove all the collision from that, both from the LOD0 but also

56
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:48,166
from Collision and then Remove Collision.

57
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:52,166
Now, of course, if we play the game from the main level or even from the

58
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:56,166
start menu, it should fall through the floor or not move at

59
00:03:56,166 --> 00:04:00,166
all. Now listen, the reason it's hovering in the air is, because the tank

60
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:04,166
body is the thing with the physics on it. Remember if we look at the tank blueprint, the tank here

61
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:08,166
is the thing with the physics. It still has Simulate Physics, it's actually grayed

62
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,166
out, and that's because there is no collider, so it doesn't have a

63
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:16,166
body to simulate physics on. So what we can do is, we could go to the tank

64
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:20,166
body for now, and let me show you a new thing about colliders here.

65
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,166
We go to Collision and we Add a Box Simplified Collision.

66
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:28,166
So you're starting with nothing, if you've got anything just remove. Start with nothing and then Add

67
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:32,166
a Box Simplified Collision to the tank. Now let's have a look at that! In fact, this

68
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:36,166
default one here is nearly good enough, to be honest. It's nearly

69
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:40,166
there. I'm going to change to a, say a Left view or a

70
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,166
Front view. There you go! It's actually, as I explained before, the tank is aligned slightly

71
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,166
off, so the views are slightly messed up, but you know, we can get to what we need.

72
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:52,166
We can see this box is a little bit high. Where do you adjust this? Well you

73
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,166
can have a look in the Details tab, and then, you can come in here and

74
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:00,166
look for... Where is it? Primitives, there you go, under Static

75
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:04,166
Mesh Settings! You have Primitive, Boxes, and there's one box, element number

76
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,166
0, array starting at 0. And then, you can change the offset, there you go!

77
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:12,166
So now, I'm just moving that box, so that it just

78
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,166
leaves maybe a little bit of the track sticking out at the bottom, as if the track is dug into the ground.

79
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:20,166
Let's try that, that's now, because I've turned collision off on all the other

80
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,166
elements of the tank. The only collision we have on the tank is on the main body

81
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:28,166
and that's actually sitting pretty nicely. Let's have a look closer!

82
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,166
Yeah that's pretty cool! And then, I can get hit in the tank body.

83
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,166
Now let me just check that the other tanks also sit on the ground nicely.

84
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:40,166
You see they're not flying off, their tracks aren't exploding out of them anymore, and we

85
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:44,166
have an incredibly simple setup now. So let's just go and take a little closer look!

86
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:48,166
I hit F8 there to come out. I don't mind those tracks slightly embedded,

87
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:52,166
and now we have a much more reasonable, i.e. a much more easy to

88
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:56,166
reason about collision system on the tanks, In fact, if I

89
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:00,166
play the game, hit F8, Show, Collision

90
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:04,166
again, and then, just zoom in, it's a very very subtle purple box but it's just a

91
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:08,166
box around the tank. Much quicker to compute, much simpler to reason about,

92
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:12,166
no internal collisions. So let's do that for now, that seems like a good idea!

93
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:16,166
OK, the other glaring omission is that from that start

94
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:20,166
menu, that main menu, there is no quit button. I would just want a quit button

95
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,166
somewhere near the start button, and of course, that's going to be your challenge, because it's

96
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,166
about time that you got back and revised UI. Now, this is another benefit of this

97
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,166
spiral syllabus, is that we keep coming back to things before they

98
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:36,166
go completely stale in your mind. So it doesn't only help us

99
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,166
to keep the game fun, which is super important because the moment your game

100
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:44,166
stops being fun, if you can't get it back to fun you want to abandon it, [laughs] basically.

101
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:48,166
You also don't want to forget things. So here's your challenge! I want you to...

102
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,166
I want you to have a challenge! Here you

103
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:56,166
go, let's try again! OK add a quite button! Add a quit button to the

104
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,166
main menu. Call application quite from the blueprint. I'll let you decide exactly

105
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:04,166
what to call from the blueprint, all of this will be coded in the blueprint, and then, just test

106
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,166
that hitting quit stops the game playing. I'm not going to give you anymore hints than that, you need to

107
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:12,166
crank up your mind again, in terms of UI, revise some previous lectures

108
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,166
if you need to, but let's get a quit button on there!

109
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,166
Well go on there! You're adding it right? [Laughs] But you're not listening right now because it's paused,

110
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,166
so I'm talking to nobody, but then when you un-pause it, you'll be hearing me. Anyway I digress,

111
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:28,166
let's get on with it! So let's go and find... Where is

112
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:32,166
this start menu in the first place? Well good question, where did we put it?

113
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:36,166
I think we put it under UI, MainMenu. So there we go, here is the

114
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,166
main menu designer! So I think what I'm going to do, that would be prudent, is to take the

115
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:44,166
Start Button there and see if I can do a Copy and then a Paste.

116
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:48,166
Will it let me paste in here?

117
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:52,166
...

118
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:56,166
No, it won't let me paste. Why not? OK instead of doing it on this

119
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:00,166
3D View you can go the the Hierarchy here, Copy there, and then,

120
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,166
Paste in the Hierarchy, under the [Canvas Panel]. There you go! So

121
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:08,166
now we have two start buttons sitting on top of each other. One and

122
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:12,166
two, now where is the second one? The second one is at the top-left.

123
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:16,166
So that's it, basically you copy it in the Hierarchy rather than copying it

124
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:20,166
there. Now I'm going to get rid of this animations timeline at the bottom, because we're not animating anything.

125
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,166
I'm going to immediately rename this asset to

126
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:28,166
QuitButton, like so, and then, I'm

127
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:32,166
going to go about making sure that it's aligned with the other button.

128
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:36,166
And then changing the text, which should be Quit

129
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,166
Text, and then, the text should be QUIT,

130
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:44,166
I'll use capitals.

131
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:48,166
Cool! So we're nearly there! And then on the button itself, rather than the text

132
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,166
element what you want to do is, you want to come down to one of the events, and I'm going to

133
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,166
choose OnReleased, so you can push Quit but

134
00:08:56,166 --> 00:09:00,166
it's not until you let go. So if you go oh I didn't really want to push Quit, you can kind of push it, move your

135
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:04,166
mouse off. Ah that may not work, but let's go with OnRelease anyway just to be

136
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,166
different. So we're going to choose OnReleased here.

137
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,166
So let's look where we are. Is this where we want to be coding it? Yeah, I think

138
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:16,166
this is perfectly reasonable! What have we got here? We've got the Event Graph for the UI.

139
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:20,166
It gets the WidgetReady, sets the Input Mode to UIOnly, gets the

140
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:24,166
Player Controller, it sets this Input Mode Game

141
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,166
Only, if you remember all that stuff. And the reason I can't edit is because I'm simulating, that was that big

142
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:32,166
simulating thing over the top there. I'm just going to de-spaghetti-fy this a little

143
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:36,166
bit. And now, I've got room for my quit button and I can search for "quit"

144
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:40,166
and then we've got Game, QuitGame. And it is as simple as that!

145
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,166
Actually, you just need to wire Quit to QuitGame. At Quit Preference,

146
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,166
Quit, or Background we're going to quit fully. So let's test it works!

147
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:52,166
Next, Compile up the blueprint, play the game from the main menu, hit Quit,

148
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:56,166
and the game stops running! Perfect! I think the final thing I'm going

149
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,166
to do on here is, just make this button in the Designer tab. Remember that

150
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,166
when you're in the MainMenu blueprint, you have a Graph tab which tells you how it works and a Designer

151
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,166
tab which tells you how it looks. I'm going to go into the Designer tab for myself,

152
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:12,166
I'm going to select the QuitButton, and I'm just going to make a slightly different background

153
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:16,166
color, just to give it the sense of quit-ability, if that's a

154
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,166
word.

155
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,166
OK that'll do!

156
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,166
That's red, it's pretty ugly, but at least we know that that's the quit button. Now notice,

157
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:32,166
I push the button down nothing happens. I can't actually

158
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,166
move away and not quit, that would take a little bit more work on the

159
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:40,166
UI, but at least it doesn't immediately quit the second you touch it. At least you can

160
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:44,166
think, oh I didn't really mean to quit! OK you can't stop it, but as an exercise

161
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:48,166
to the reader by the way, if you want a bit of an extra challenge, the key runs out there.

162
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:52,166
Make is so that you push down on Quit, if you move the mouse off and let go that

163
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:56,166
actually it doesn't quit. But for everybody else this is fine, we can start the game, the tanks

164
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,166
don't disappear, we have super simplified collision, we have a quit button,

165
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:04,166
and happy days are ahead! So see you in

166
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,932
the next video!
