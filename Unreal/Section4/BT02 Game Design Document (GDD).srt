1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. welcome to Game

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Design Document or GDD. In this video. we'll

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
talk about and create the concept rules and initial requirements for the game.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In fact. it's going to be your challenge to write that stuff out. once we've discussed the game a little bit.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We'll iterate around a loop. by the way. while making this game. which I'll introduce

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you to in a moment. We'll be constantly asking

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
what's least fun. so as we go around this loop of working

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
on the terrain and the tank and the weapons

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and that sort of stuff. we'll keep coming full circle and say what's least

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
fun and try to make sure that the thing is always getting more and more fun! All the time

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it's getting more fun. it's worth developing. Remember that we're not

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
triple A studios here. right. We don't have a million dollar art budget.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so we need to try and do the best we can with our lower budgets and focus on our

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
game being fun. So. let's find the essence

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of the fun in this game. is basically what I'm saying.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So. we're going to write out concept rules and requirements. but before we do. let's

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
go and take a look at the research that we did from the last video. So.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I've played some World of Tanks. I've actually really enjoyed it. Probably played it a bit longer than I should have done.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I've had a look at some tank videos. done a lot of things I've asked you to do. basically. Did you

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
note how the controls work in World of Tanks? The left stick moves your tank around

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in a forward. backwards. left. right sort of

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
way. but the gun stays pointing in the same position.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Your right stick actually moves the gun aim point.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
so that's quite a novel form of control. We'll experiment with a few different ones. before deciding

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
for sure that this is what we want to do. So. this is like a fly by wire tank that they're

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
using. where the turret will always point in the same position.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
unless you either tell it to point elsewhere or you climb up a piece of

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
terrain that makes it impossible for the turret to point in that position. So

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's quite interesting. it works quite well. it's certainly good for shooting. It doesn't really give you

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
much of a sense of driving the tank. I don't feel. I would quite like to have independence.

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
be in control over the two tracks perhaps. on the two triggers on a controller.

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but you know. we can play with different types of control. But the general idea we're going to

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
have is just single tank vs. single tank in an open terrain. something like we're seeing here.

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
with hills in the way so that we can get some cover. And you could

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
take a certain number of shots. before you're dead. and you'll have a simple indicator on the screen saying

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
how much damage you've taken. And then. the other tank will either be an AI

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
or it'll be another player on split screen. possibly on a second

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
monitor depending on how we get on. And the idea is to position yourself. get in range.

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and then shoot the other tank. and it's going to be a lot of fun! So.

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
what I'd like you to do is write out what you think. in

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
your words. the concepts. rules. and requirements are for this

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
game. And remember that the concept is just like a paragraph. saying what

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it's all about. The rules are how you win. how you lose. what you're allowed

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to do. what you're not. And the requirements. think about sound effects. think about

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
art. think about music. think about things like that.

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And then. when you're finished come back. share those things. by the way. with your

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
fellow students in the discussions. so that we can see what your ideas are

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
for the game. It'll also steer the direction of this section slightly. for those people who are taking it as

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it's produced. and then. pop back in and I'll talk you through my concept rules

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and requirements. Hey. welcome

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
back! So. I'm just going to say that the concept is a simple tank battle in an open world.

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and it's a head to head tank combat game. And the terrain will be used for

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
tactical advantage and the focus will be on flow and feel. We just want this to flow

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
well and feel good. The rules. well you can move anywhere in the terrain. which is surrounded by mountains. so you

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
can't get out of the terrain. Both players start with finite health and ammo.

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and each direct hit takes away health and the last player standing wins.

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So there are the simple rules and the requirements. Well. sound effects wise. we're going to need

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
a gun firing. an explosion. maybe the barrel going up and down. the turret moving.

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and the engine sound. Static

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
meshes. we'll we're going to need a simple tank comprising of tracks. body.

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
turret. and barrel. But in the first place. I'm just going to use primitives inside Unreal. and

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
we'll actually build up the mesh requirements later. might buy in an

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
asset have some custom assets made. We'll see as we go through but I want to show

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
you how to start with just using primitive objects. just to test the control system and test the audio

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of your game. Later on. we'll want to add some textures for visual flair

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and we'll want some sort of background music to create some tension in here. which will be fun

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of course. Cool. so that's the GDD done! It's easy isn't it

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
GDD's! They are worth doing. they don't take long. and they do make you think about

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
what's involved. You'll probably never look at it again. You might look at it again and update it.

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
but it's not to be stressed about. but it's definitely worth the exercise of just doing.

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So. how are we going to build this game? Well. let's do an Iterative Cycle.

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Let's go around and around and around making sure that it's always fun at every stage. So. we'll build the world

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
first. just get a very simple terrain out there. Then. we'll put something

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
representing a tank. It'll probably start just as a cube. just a block. Then.

75
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
we'll think about the controls. because a block sitting in a world is a bit boring. so we'll think about how

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
we're going to control this thing and we'll try at least one. perhaps a couple of options for control schemes.

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Then. we'll think about this Player 2 thing. which is either a

78
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
human player or an AI. We need something to shoot at. alright. even if it's not moving anywhere

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
in the beginning. Then. we'll get some basic User Interface. We need to

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
know whether the other player is nearly dead and how many bullets we've got left and when we can fire next.

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Before going back to the world and saying: Right the world is probably really boring. Let's make it a bit

82
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
more interesting a bit more challenging. and then. we'll keep going around the loop again

83
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and again and again. Weapon systems will be included over here in Tank.

84
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Controls will be everything to do with controls. Player 2 is Player 2 in AI. UI

85
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
is User interface. So. you get the idea! We're going to go around this loop again and again and again. until

86
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
we've decided our game is good enough for an initial shipping.

87
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So that is is! That's a Game Design Document. that's pretty cool! Your challenge was earlier on; you've already

88
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
written out your ideas. So. if you haven't done it already. write

89
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and share your GDD. Write your understanding of the concepts. the rules. the requirements.

90
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and share your work with us. And I will see you in the next video. where we'll actually set this

91
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
project up in GitHub. on the web this time. and

92
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
take a little look at Version Control a bit more deeply. before diving into the project!

93
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.433
