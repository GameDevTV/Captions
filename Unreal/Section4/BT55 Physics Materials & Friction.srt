00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to what it says on

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the screen. Physics Material & Friction! In this video we

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are going to talk about Physics Material and Friction. Sorry to be trite.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So the point is. the tank is going to be able to move. because we will have assigned physics materials to the

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
tracks and we will have adjusted the frictional values and  driving forces.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so that our tank can move in a slightly strange way. for the moment. but at least it's moving.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.600


8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.600
So we've been applying a force to the tank. We determined. by having the

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.600
tank float in the air. that it should be sufficient force to make this guy accelerate

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.600
but he's stuck to the ground. What are we going to do about that? There is a certain amount of

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.600
friction between the tank and the ground. As you can see. when we get hit by a projectile we

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.600
slide for quite a long way. but we do come to a halt. So

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.600
let's now tweak two things. the power or the force rather that

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.600
we are pushing the tank with and the friction between

15
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.600
the tank and the ground. Let me show you how to adjust both of those things. So

16
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.600
if we go to the tank blueprint. just to remind ourselves how it's put together.

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.600
and take a look. a good place to orientate ourselves. It's these tracks

18
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
that are in contact... Well it looks like it's the tracks that are in contact with the

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.600
ground. but actually. right now. it's not is it? If we go to the BattleGround. play the game.

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.600
depossess with F8. and make sure that collision is on.

21
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.600
under the Show menu. you'll see that actually we've just put... It's very very hard to

22
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.600
see this. it's a very thin purple box. But we've just put a

23
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.600
[Laughs] I got hit. We've just put a single box collider on

24
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.600
the tank. so there's this big slab we're trying to move around.

25
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.600
and when we get to hills and things that's not going to respond very well. so we are going to

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.600
now move back to having discreet components. And if we have any problems with

27
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.600
self-collision then we will overcome them now. rather than working

28
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.600
around them. Last time we worked around them. because it was good enough to get moving. This time we need to

29
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.600
confront the issues head on. So one thing I want to say. before we do that.

30
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.600
is that I am on Unreal 4.12.4. If you're

31
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.600
on an earlier version of Unreal on that please upgrade to 4.12.4. because

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.600
we were experiencing problems in any previous versions. particularly in 4.12.3.

33
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.600
with the way that components with colliders

34
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.600
on them interact with each other. It's something to do with welding. OK. so

35
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.600
let's go ahead and change the way these colliders work! There's our tank body.

36
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.600
Remember that it has a primitive on it. which is just a box right now.

37
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.600
OK. so what we're going to do is just show collision.

38
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.600
I'm going to take a Left view. I think will be from the front.

39
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.600
strangely because of the way our tank is orientated. Um. and I'm going to

40
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.600
change the Y extents to bring it in. a little bit of clearance between the body collider and

41
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.600
the tracks. Change the Z Extents a bit and then move it up.

42
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.600
in the Z position

43
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.600
like so. So now we have a collider. which mainly covers the

44
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.600
body of the tank. Great! Let's look at that in

45
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.600
3D. You can see that it's covering mainly the body.

46
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.600
Now that paves the way for us to actually put collision back on the tracks. so let's go

47
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.600
ahead and do that! We can go to the tracks. we can go and find the track mesh. which

48
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.600
is here. Where is it? It didn't

49
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.600
come up! Um. go find it. There we go?!

50
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.600
Left Track mesh. turn on collision. and you can create yourself a 26

51
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.600
DOP Collision Mesh. something like that which looks about right. It's going to behave quite well going

52
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.600
up and down slopes. without being overly complicated. And now.

53
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.600
when we go back. let's go ahead and just play the game and see how we get on with those two

54
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.600
separate Collision Meshes. Now if you find that one of your tracks falls

55
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.600
into the ground or something like that. please check your Unreal 4.12.4.

56
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.600
Also. check that this works from the main menu. this is a great

57
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.600
time to be checking that. because what we've noticed is a problem with the way that

58
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.600
the tank is constructed in terms of a timing problem. It's what we call a race condition.

59
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.600
And the place that this may manifest. if you're having a bug. is

60
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.600
as follows. What you have is the tank and then you have the Left

61
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.600
and Right Tracks as sub-objects. and you'll notice that you should have a property ticked on those.

62
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.600
called Auto Weld. if I can find it.

63
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.600
Here you go! It's under Physics and then the extended physics

64
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.600
properties. You need to do the drop-down under Physics. off the Left and Right Track. under the

65
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.600
extended properties you have Auto Weld. If you were to turn Auto Weld off. let's

66
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.600
see what happens. You see it ignores those

67
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.600
track colliders. it's just landing on the body collider. So we do need Auto Weld

68
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.600
on. because we want the collision meshes of the tracks

69
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.600
to weld into the same mesh as the body. as it says here. "If true

70
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.600
and is attached to a parent. the two bodies will be joined into a single rigid body." "Physics settings like

71
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.600
collision profile and body settings are determined by the root". So they're saying that the root

72
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600
up here. the Tank. will determine the Mass and all these physics settings. but these Left and Right Tracks

73
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.600
will contribute to the overall collision. OK. so you do want Auto

74
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.600
Weld on. Now it's possible that you could get a problem where

75
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.600
Auto Welding doesn't work say from the main menu but does work from the game.

76
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.600
and this could be to do with the time that the objects are constructed and whether the

77
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.600
welding works properly or not. at that time. If you're having

78
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.600
that trouble then there is a way to get around it in blueprint. but I don't think you'll be getting the trouble in

79
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.600
Unreal 4.12.4. I haven't seen it once in this version. So

80
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.600
if you're really stuck for any reason or you're getting any horrible behavior here. then remember you can always

81
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.600
go to GitHub. and you can go and get our project at this stage by

82
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.600
following through to Unreal. then the section. then the commits.

83
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.600
find the video. this video which isn't there yet. and then go and get the code by clicking

84
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.600
on it or by clicking over here on the right. and then. you can clone or download

85
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.600
the repo. OK. so that's important! Alright. so I think we've said enough about that.

86
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.600
We have now got the tank resting on its tracks.

87
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.600
so why isn't it moving? Well firstly. let's get control over the friction between the tracks

88
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.600
and the ground. If we go ahead and look at these tracks and scroll down.

89
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.600
inside the tank blueprint. you'll see you've got this Physical Material

90
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.600
override option. under Collision section. Well there is no

91
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.600
material. so let's make ourselves our first physics material. I'm going to put that in the Tank

92
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.600
folder. because it's very much related to the tank. and then. I am

93
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.600
going to go to Add New. scroll down to Physics. and it's actually the only thing in it.

94
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.600
Physical Material. I'm going to call it TrackMaterial

95
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.600
or just Track. because it is of type Physics Material.

96
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.600
So we don't need anymore naming than that. And if we go into it. we can see we've got a few basic

97
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.600
settings. one of them is Friction. Let's turn the track

98
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.600
Friction down to say 0.2. Now

99
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.600
there is an issue of Friction Combine Mode. and this is set in

100
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.600
two places. This is answering the question. how do I combine the Friction setting

101
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.600
on the track with the Friction setting on the ground. Now where is that

102
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.600
friction setting on the ground? Well it's in the actual Grass_

103
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.600
LayerInfo here. Whatever you've painted the ground with. at that point. whether it's

104
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.600
grass. mud. ice. whatever. in that LayerInfo you can see

105
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600
that there is a Physics Material option. Now the grass doesn't have a Physics Material.

106
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.600
at the moment. We could give it one but that's beyond what we need to be doing here.

107
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.600
We could assign different Physics Materials to grass. snow. ice. and have the

108
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.600
tank behave differently but for now let's keep it simple. So we won't do that but I just want to point

109
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.600
out that the friction is not just determined by the track's friction but it's

110
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.600
combined with the friction of the ground. There is also a project

111
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.600
level setting under Project Settings and Physics. which

112
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.600
determines. in general or by default. how these things are combined. and it's here.

113
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.600
Friction Combine Mode. I'm not going to change that. I'm just going to give you the context.

114
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.600
The way that we're going to make our friction work is quite simple. We're going to override the Friction

115
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.600
Combine Mode and choose Minimum. and that means that we

116
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.600
are going to most likely. given that the other thing that we're touching the ground

117
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.600
doesn't even have a Physics Material. we're most likely going to end up with this 0.2 as the minimum of

118
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.600
the two physics values. OK. so let's see how much difference

119
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.600
that makes. We need to assign this Physics Material to both the Left and the Right Tracks.

120
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.600
Now that we have it. we can just go to Collision in the tank blueprint.

121
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.600
select the Left and the Right Track. with the Control button. and then

122
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.600
for Physics Material Override set Track. Remember to Compile. And now let's just try

123
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.600
moving the tank. It's not quite moving. See that other tank though. it

124
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.600
slid down the slope a lot faster. so there is a lot less friction on it.

125
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.600
And that looks fairly reasonable to me. so the next thing to do is

126
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.600
to increase the force with which we move the tank. Now this isn't an ideal way to move

127
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.600
this tank. We're moving this tank by shoving it along the ground on these

128
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.600
flat colliders. There are other ways that you could approach this.

129
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.600
You could. for example. put some hidden wheels. a bit like these actual

130
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.600
wheels underneath the track. and you could use things called Physics constraints which

131
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.600
are down here in the Physics section. And you could try and make axles

132
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.600
and make some wheels move. but you'll end up with your own problems doing that. with different types

133
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.600
of problems. And you could try and have wheels

134
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.600
that revolve and pull the tank along. but the way that I'm going to show you how to do this.

135
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.600
by just making the tank pretty slippery and then using some code to stop it sliding

136
00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.600
sideways and looking like it's on ice. is going to be more general. It'll allow you to make

137
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.600
hover tanks. it'll allow you to do basic things with certain types of aircraft or air

138
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.600
hockey. and you're going to learn more by doing it this way. So let's pursue this

139
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.600
root. Alright. so these tracks have got this track material on

140
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.600
now. As I say. the only thing that's making it not be able to move is that we haven't got enough

141
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.600
driving force. So I'm going to turn my driving force up. In my case. it's now

142
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.600
4 Million. Let's try that and see if it's enough! I'm going to pull

143
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.600
both throttles to 100%! And it's not enough. so let's iterate

144
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.600
up again to 40 Million. Now we're a thousands times bigger force than we expected

145
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.600
to be now but that's because of the amount of friction! There's a huge difference between pushing a frictionless

146
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.600
tank and expecting a tank with 40 tons

147
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.600
of force to slide on massive tracks. it would take a huge

148
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.600
amount of force! And there you go. it's moving around! In fact. I'm going to turn my game controller on

149
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.600
and just have a quick go from the game controller. before I put you into your challenge. which is just going to be

150
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.600
to tune up your physics. your combination of friction and track.

151
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.600
sorry track friction and driving

152
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.600
force. Cool that's fun! OK. one final thing before

153
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.600
we do that! Let's go to the Project Settings. Input. and I'm going to bind the

154
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.600
Shoulder buttons for a reversing throttle on the Left and Right.

155
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.600
I'm going to get rid of these left and right keys. I think. and instead of that. I think I'm going to look for

156
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.600
Shoulder button. Left Shoulder gives me an input scale of say

157
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.600
-0.5. Driving back at half speeds is like pulling the

158
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.600
trigger in halfway. and the Right Shoulder will give

159
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.600
me -0.5 as well. Bear in mind. if you ever expose this

160
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.600
as a sensitivity to a user. which you probably wouldn't do in this case. you might with the triggers

161
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.600
but you probably wouldn't with the Shoulder buttons. Then they could if you allowed the user to

162
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.600
change this 0.5. they could potentially make their tank go faster than somebody else's. so beware of that.

163
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.600
but. for now. it's absolutely fine.

164
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.600
We'll worry about that if and when we every expose that value. Now. this is me holding both Shoulder

165
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.600
buttons on my gamepad down. and if I hold down both triggers

166
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.600
then I can go forward. if I hold down just the right trigger

167
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.600
or just the left trigger. that's sliding all over the place

168
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.600
but we'll sort that out later. And if I hold down one Trigger and one Shoulder button I can rotate.

169
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.600
So look. we have agency. we can move the tank and we can aim the tank. so

170
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.600
we are. starting. starting to get there! I think I've got too much friction

171
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.600
or too little friction rather but it's difficult to say. because shortly we're going to stop

172
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.600
these projectiles from actually making us fly like this because

173
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.600
they don't need to be doing that. We can handle the projectile collisions. rather than with

174
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.633
physics. as just actual events. and then. decide how to process those events.

175
00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:37.633
So I'd like you to tweak your Physics Settings. Set your track

176
00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:41.633
Max Driving Force. I'm using 40 Million Newtons in my

177
00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:45.633
case. What is 40 Million Newtons. by the way? Well a kilogram

178
00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:49.633
weighs about 10 Newtons. 9.8 something. it depends where you're on

179
00:11:49.633 --> 00:11:53.633
the Earth. Call it 10! so 40 Million Newtons is

180
00:11:53.633 --> 00:11:57.633
4 Million kilograms. which is 4.000 tons! So [Laughs]

181
00:11:57.633 --> 00:12:01.633
that's a lot of force. but with a 40 ton tank

182
00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:05.633
sitting flat on the ground. it's possible that it needs that much

183
00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:09.633
force to move. so it's still within the realms of possibility. The problem is that we don't have revolving

184
00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:13.633
wheels. and the reason is that it's quite hard to model a tank. they're quite a unique

185
00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:17.633
way of moving. They're neither wheels nor are they slabs. that's the thing about tracks;

186
00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:21.633
they're wheels. they're kind of moving slabs with wheels on the inside.

187
00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:25.633
So set your track physics material. friction value! I'm using 0.2 for this. and by the

188
00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:29.633
way. a friction coefficient of 0.2. you might wonder what it means. I hate

189
00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:33.633
things without units. right? Well actually. the friction coefficient of 0.2 is

190
00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:37.633
unit-less. which is why I've not put a unit there. but what it is. is it's a force.

191
00:12:37.633 --> 00:12:41.633
It's just like contact force and it's 0.4 times the contact force.

192
00:12:41.633 --> 00:12:45.633
However hard the track is pushing into the ground. typically on flat

193
00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:49.633
ground. that would be half the weight of the tank. however hard that track is pushing into

194
00:12:49.633 --> 00:12:53.633
the ground. what this friction force means is that the tank will start to slip. when

195
00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:57.633
you push it sideways. forward. backwards. left. right. with 20%

196
00:12:57.633 --> 00:13:01.633
of that contact force. OK. on that track. That's what a Friction

197
00:13:01.633 --> 00:13:05.633
Coefficient mean. it's a proportion of the contact force at which point

198
00:13:05.633 --> 00:13:09.633
you start to slip. So go ahead. pause the video. tweak up your physics settings now.

199
00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:13.633
and when you un-pause the video it'll be the end of the video. So just

200
00:13:13.633 --> 00:13:17.633
tweak your physics settings. and why not share what you've done with your physics settings over

201
00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:21.633
in our new community. You're probably aware that I've made www.community.gamedev.tv

202
00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:25.633
here for you. There's a lounge that anybody can join. there's

203
00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:29.633
more importantly Unreal. and you can go straight to the Battle Tank section. and you can go ahead and just

204
00:13:29.633 --> 00:13:33.633
discuss in there. and you're going to find all sorts of interesting things. Please do check out

205
00:13:33.633 --> 00:13:37.633
this here. the HoverTank project. One of our students

206
00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:41.633
has made a fantastic looking hover tank! Look at this for inspiration! Low poly.

207
00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:45.633
erie. landscape. some nice effects on it. So do

208
00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:49.633
share your work in there. and I will see you in the next

209
00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:52.366
video!

=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to what it says on

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the screen, Physics Material & Friction! In this video we

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
are going to talk about Physics Material and Friction. Sorry to be trite.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So the point is, the tank is going to be able to move, because we will have assigned physics materials to the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
tracks and we will have adjusted the frictional values and  driving forces,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so that our tank can move in a slightly strange way, for the moment, but at least it's moving.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,600


8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,600
So we've been applying a force to the tank. We determined, by having the

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,600
tank float in the air, that it should be sufficient force to make this guy accelerate

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,600
but he's stuck to the ground. What are we going to do about that? There is a certain amount of

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,600
friction between the tank and the ground. As you can see, when we get hit by a projectile we

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
slide for quite a long way, but we do come to a halt. So

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
let's now tweak two things, the power or the force rather that

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,600
we are pushing the tank with and the friction between

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,600
the tank and the ground. Let me show you how to adjust both of those things. So

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,600
if we go to the tank blueprint, just to remind ourselves how it's put together,

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
and take a look, a good place to orientate ourselves. It's these tracks

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
that are in contact... Well it looks like it's the tracks that are in contact with the

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,600
ground, but actually, right now, it's not is it? If we go to the BattleGround, play the game,

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,600
depossess with F8, and make sure that collision is on,

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
under the Show menu, you'll see that actually we've just put... It's very very hard to

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
see this, it's a very thin purple box. But we've just put a

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,600
[Laughs] I got hit. We've just put a single box collider on

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,600
the tank, so there's this big slab we're trying to move around,

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
and when we get to hills and things that's not going to respond very well, so we are going to

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,600
now move back to having discreet components. And if we have any problems with

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,600
self-collision then we will overcome them now, rather than working

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,600
around them. Last time we worked around them, because it was good enough to get moving. This time we need to

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,600
confront the issues head on. So one thing I want to say, before we do that,

30
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,600
is that I am on Unreal 4.12.4. If you're

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
on an earlier version of Unreal on that please upgrade to 4.12.4, because

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,600
we were experiencing problems in any previous versions, particularly in 4.12.3,

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,600
with the way that components with colliders

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,600
on them interact with each other. It's something to do with welding. OK, so

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
let's go ahead and change the way these colliders work! There's our tank body.

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Remember that it has a primitive on it, which is just a box right now.

37
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,600
OK, so what we're going to do is just show collision.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,600
I'm going to take a Left view, I think will be from the front,

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,600
strangely because of the way our tank is orientated. Um, and I'm going to

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
change the Y extents to bring it in, a little bit of clearance between the body collider and

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
the tracks. Change the Z Extents a bit and then move it up,

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
in the Z position

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
like so. So now we have a collider, which mainly covers the

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
body of the tank. Great! Let's look at that in

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
3D. You can see that it's covering mainly the body.

46
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Now that paves the way for us to actually put collision back on the tracks, so let's go

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
ahead and do that! We can go to the tracks, we can go and find the track mesh, which

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
is here. Where is it? It didn't

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
come up! Um, go find it. There we go?!

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Left Track mesh, turn on collision, and you can create yourself a 26

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
DOP Collision Mesh, something like that which looks about right. It's going to behave quite well going

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
up and down slopes, without being overly complicated. And now,

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,600
when we go back, let's go ahead and just play the game and see how we get on with those two

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
separate Collision Meshes. Now if you find that one of your tracks falls

55
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
into the ground or something like that, please check your Unreal 4.12.4.

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Also, check that this works from the main menu, this is a great

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
time to be checking that, because what we've noticed is a problem with the way that

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,600
the tank is constructed in terms of a timing problem. It's what we call a race condition.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
And the place that this may manifest, if you're having a bug, is

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,600
as follows. What you have is the tank and then you have the Left

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
and Right Tracks as sub-objects, and you'll notice that you should have a property ticked on those,

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
called Auto Weld, if I can find it.

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Here you go! It's under Physics and then the extended physics

64
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
properties. You need to do the drop-down under Physics, off the Left and Right Track, under the

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
extended properties you have Auto Weld. If you were to turn Auto Weld off, let's

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
see what happens. You see it ignores those

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
track colliders, it's just landing on the body collider. So we do need Auto Weld

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
on, because we want the collision meshes of the tracks

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
to weld into the same mesh as the body, as it says here. "If true

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
and is attached to a parent, the two bodies will be joined into a single rigid body." "Physics settings like

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
collision profile and body settings are determined by the root". So they're saying that the root

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
up here, the Tank, will determine the Mass and all these physics settings, but these Left and Right Tracks

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
will contribute to the overall collision. OK, so you do want Auto

74
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Weld on. Now it's possible that you could get a problem where

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Auto Welding doesn't work say from the main menu but does work from the game,

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
and this could be to do with the time that the objects are constructed and whether the

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
welding works properly or not, at that time. If you're having

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
that trouble then there is a way to get around it in blueprint, but I don't think you'll be getting the trouble in

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Unreal 4.12.4, I haven't seen it once in this version. So

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
if you're really stuck for any reason or you're getting any horrible behavior here, then remember you can always

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
go to GitHub, and you can go and get our project at this stage by

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,600
following through to Unreal, then the section, then the commits,

83
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
find the video, this video which isn't there yet, and then go and get the code by clicking

84
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,600
on it or by clicking over here on the right, and then, you can clone or download

85
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
the repo. OK, so that's important! Alright, so I think we've said enough about that.

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
We have now got the tank resting on its tracks,

87
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
so why isn't it moving? Well firstly, let's get control over the friction between the tracks

88
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,600
and the ground. If we go ahead and look at these tracks and scroll down,

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
inside the tank blueprint, you'll see you've got this Physical Material

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,600
override option, under Collision section. Well there is no

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,600
material, so let's make ourselves our first physics material. I'm going to put that in the Tank

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,600
folder, because it's very much related to the tank, and then, I am

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,600
going to go to Add New, scroll down to Physics, and it's actually the only thing in it,

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Physical Material. I'm going to call it TrackMaterial

95
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
or just Track, because it is of type Physics Material.

96
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,600
So we don't need anymore naming than that. And if we go into it, we can see we've got a few basic

97
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
settings, one of them is Friction. Let's turn the track

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Friction down to say 0.2. Now

99
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,600
there is an issue of Friction Combine Mode, and this is set in

100
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,600
two places. This is answering the question, how do I combine the Friction setting

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
on the track with the Friction setting on the ground. Now where is that

102
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
friction setting on the ground? Well it's in the actual Grass_

103
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,600
LayerInfo here. Whatever you've painted the ground with, at that point, whether it's

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,600
grass, mud, ice, whatever, in that LayerInfo you can see

105
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
that there is a Physics Material option. Now the grass doesn't have a Physics Material,

106
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
at the moment. We could give it one but that's beyond what we need to be doing here.

107
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,600
We could assign different Physics Materials to grass, snow, ice, and have the

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
tank behave differently but for now let's keep it simple. So we won't do that but I just want to point

109
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,600
out that the friction is not just determined by the track's friction but it's

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
combined with the friction of the ground. There is also a project

111
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,600
level setting under Project Settings and Physics, which

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
determines, in general or by default, how these things are combined, and it's here,

113
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Friction Combine Mode. I'm not going to change that, I'm just going to give you the context.

114
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,600
The way that we're going to make our friction work is quite simple. We're going to override the Friction

115
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Combine Mode and choose Minimum, and that means that we

116
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,600
are going to most likely, given that the other thing that we're touching the ground

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
doesn't even have a Physics Material, we're most likely going to end up with this 0.2 as the minimum of

118
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,600
the two physics values. OK, so let's see how much difference

119
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,600
that makes. We need to assign this Physics Material to both the Left and the Right Tracks.

120
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Now that we have it, we can just go to Collision in the tank blueprint,

121
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,600
select the Left and the Right Track, with the Control button, and then

122
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,600
for Physics Material Override set Track. Remember to Compile. And now let's just try

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,600
moving the tank. It's not quite moving. See that other tank though, it

124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,600
slid down the slope a lot faster, so there is a lot less friction on it.

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,600
And that looks fairly reasonable to me, so the next thing to do is

126
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,600
to increase the force with which we move the tank. Now this isn't an ideal way to move

127
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,600
this tank. We're moving this tank by shoving it along the ground on these

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,600
flat colliders. There are other ways that you could approach this.

129
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600
You could, for example, put some hidden wheels, a bit like these actual

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
wheels underneath the track, and you could use things called Physics constraints which

131
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
are down here in the Physics section. And you could try and make axles

132
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,600
and make some wheels move, but you'll end up with your own problems doing that, with different types

133
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
of problems. And you could try and have wheels

134
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,600
that revolve and pull the tank along, but the way that I'm going to show you how to do this,

135
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,600
by just making the tank pretty slippery and then using some code to stop it sliding

136
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,600
sideways and looking like it's on ice, is going to be more general. It'll allow you to make

137
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,600
hover tanks, it'll allow you to do basic things with certain types of aircraft or air

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
hockey, and you're going to learn more by doing it this way. So let's pursue this

139
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,600
root. Alright, so these tracks have got this track material on

140
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,600
now. As I say, the only thing that's making it not be able to move is that we haven't got enough

141
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,600
driving force. So I'm going to turn my driving force up. In my case, it's now

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,600
4 Million. Let's try that and see if it's enough! I'm going to pull

143
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,600
both throttles to 100%! And it's not enough, so let's iterate

144
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
up again to 40 Million. Now we're a thousands times bigger force than we expected

145
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
to be now but that's because of the amount of friction! There's a huge difference between pushing a frictionless

146
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
tank and expecting a tank with 40 tons

147
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
of force to slide on massive tracks, it would take a huge

148
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
amount of force! And there you go, it's moving around! In fact, I'm going to turn my game controller on

149
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
and just have a quick go from the game controller, before I put you into your challenge, which is just going to be

150
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,600
to tune up your physics, your combination of friction and track,

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
sorry track friction and driving

152
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
force. Cool that's fun! OK, one final thing before

153
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
we do that! Let's go to the Project Settings, Input, and I'm going to bind the

154
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Shoulder buttons for a reversing throttle on the Left and Right.

155
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I'm going to get rid of these left and right keys, I think, and instead of that, I think I'm going to look for

156
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Shoulder button. Left Shoulder gives me an input scale of say

157
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
-0.5. Driving back at half speeds is like pulling the

158
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,600
trigger in halfway, and the Right Shoulder will give

159
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
me -0.5 as well. Bear in mind, if you ever expose this

160
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,600
as a sensitivity to a user, which you probably wouldn't do in this case, you might with the triggers

161
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
but you probably wouldn't with the Shoulder buttons. Then they could if you allowed the user to

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
change this 0.5, they could potentially make their tank go faster than somebody else's, so beware of that,

163
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,600
but, for now, it's absolutely fine.

164
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
We'll worry about that if and when we every expose that value. Now, this is me holding both Shoulder

165
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,600
buttons on my gamepad down, and if I hold down both triggers

166
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,600
then I can go forward, if I hold down just the right trigger

167
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,600
or just the left trigger, that's sliding all over the place

168
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
but we'll sort that out later. And if I hold down one Trigger and one Shoulder button I can rotate.

169
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
So look, we have agency, we can move the tank and we can aim the tank, so

170
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
we are, starting, starting to get there! I think I've got too much friction

171
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,600
or too little friction rather but it's difficult to say, because shortly we're going to stop

172
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,600
these projectiles from actually making us fly like this because

173
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,600
they don't need to be doing that. We can handle the projectile collisions, rather than with

174
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,633
physics, as just actual events, and then, decide how to process those events.

175
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:37,633
So I'd like you to tweak your Physics Settings. Set your track

176
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:41,633
Max Driving Force. I'm using 40 Million Newtons in my

177
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:45,633
case. What is 40 Million Newtons, by the way? Well a kilogram

178
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:49,633
weighs about 10 Newtons, 9.8 something, it depends where you're on

179
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:53,633
the Earth. Call it 10! so 40 Million Newtons is

180
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:57,633
4 Million kilograms, which is 4,000 tons! So [Laughs]

181
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,633
that's a lot of force, but with a 40 ton tank

182
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:05,633
sitting flat on the ground, it's possible that it needs that much

183
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:09,633
force to move, so it's still within the realms of possibility. The problem is that we don't have revolving

184
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:13,633
wheels, and the reason is that it's quite hard to model a tank, they're quite a unique

185
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,633
way of moving. They're neither wheels nor are they slabs, that's the thing about tracks;

186
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:21,633
they're wheels, they're kind of moving slabs with wheels on the inside.

187
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:25,633
So set your track physics material, friction value! I'm using 0.2 for this, and by the

188
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:29,633
way, a friction coefficient of 0.2, you might wonder what it means. I hate

189
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:33,633
things without units, right? Well actually, the friction coefficient of 0.2 is

190
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:37,633
unit-less, which is why I've not put a unit there, but what it is, is it's a force.

191
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:41,633
It's just like contact force and it's 0.4 times the contact force.

192
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:45,633
However hard the track is pushing into the ground, typically on flat

193
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:49,633
ground, that would be half the weight of the tank, however hard that track is pushing into

194
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:53,633
the ground, what this friction force means is that the tank will start to slip, when

195
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:57,633
you push it sideways, forward, backwards, left, right, with 20%

196
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:01,633
of that contact force, OK, on that track. That's what a Friction

197
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:05,633
Coefficient mean, it's a proportion of the contact force at which point

198
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,633
you start to slip. So go ahead, pause the video, tweak up your physics settings now,

199
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:13,633
and when you un-pause the video it'll be the end of the video. So just

200
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:17,633
tweak your physics settings, and why not share what you've done with your physics settings over

201
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:21,633
in our new community. You're probably aware that I've made www.community.gamedev.tv

202
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:25,633
here for you. There's a lounge that anybody can join, there's

203
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:29,633
more importantly Unreal, and you can go straight to the Battle Tank section, and you can go ahead and just

204
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:33,633
discuss in there, and you're going to find all sorts of interesting things. Please do check out

205
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:37,633
this here, the HoverTank project. One of our students

206
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:41,633
has made a fantastic looking hover tank! Look at this for inspiration! Low poly,

207
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:45,633
erie, landscape, some nice effects on it. So do

208
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:49,633
share your work in there, and I will see you in the next

209
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:52,366
video!
