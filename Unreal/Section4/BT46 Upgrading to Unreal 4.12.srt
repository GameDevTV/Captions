00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello and welcome to Upgrading

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to Unreal 4.12. In fact. I need to update the top-right of these slides. moving forward.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to indicate that we will be using 4.12 from here on. So. that's what we're going to be

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
doing. upgrading to 4.12. We will also be removing our versions

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of 4.10 and 4.11. to free up lots of space on our disk.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.900
and upgrading both projects like this. so see you in there!

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.900
So. I don't know if this is happening for you. but when I open my projectile blueprint.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.900
now since the end of the last video just a few minutes ago. the blueprint is not

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.900
working properly. It doesn't matter what I do with the menus. I can't get all of the blueprint information

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.900
up. It's not a general problem with the Blueprint Editor. because it is fine for the Tank.

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.900
So. I've tried a few things to sort this out. and the thing that I found worked

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.900
most effectively was just opening the project in Unreal 4.12.

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.900
So. that's what we're going to do. learn a little bit about source control and also upgrade all our projects

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.900
to Unreal 4.12. So. I'm going to start with Buidling

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.900
Escape. The first thing I want to do is. make sure that my current state

16
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.900
of my project on the disk is in the correct place. so I have some

17
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.900
what we call. uncommitted changes here. That means there are some changes to the

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.900
repository since I last worked on it. and the

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.900
head tells me what my current disk state is. So.

20
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.900
I'm checked out at applying materials. plus there are a few changes

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.900
since then. That's not what I want. I want. before I do my upgrade. to

22
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.900
start where I left off. Now. I left off on BE44. as I call it

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.900
the Section Wrap-Up video. then I just updated the readme file. so that's

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.900
where I want to be. An easy way to get there is to use something called stash. This Stash

25
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.900
button just saves all of these changes. so that you could get back to them

26
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.900
if you wanted to. and then. checks you out in the last place. which is

27
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.900
now the correct place. We are here. checked out

28
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.900
on master. If we just say Checkout Master to be sure. you can see now

29
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.900
that we are nearly at the top of master. What it's telling us here

30
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.900
is that. my current disk state is here at BE44.

31
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.900
but at origin. i.e. on my Remote repository which

32
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.900
is up on Github. I've updated a readme. So. what I

33
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.900
want to do to get there is. this little arrow here says I need to pull that down. That means I'm able

34
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.900
to change in another computer. and I haven't currently brought that down to you.

35
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.900
Great! Now we're all in line. the master branch. the origin/

36
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.900
master. and the Head of origin I don't really care about. OK. so now my

37
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.900
local file system actually has this readme file in it. We could

38
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.900
just have a look at that. for instance. We could go to the repos.

39
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.900
we could go to BattleTank. back to our

40
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.900
Unreal BuildingEscape. and there's the README.md

41
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.900
file. And what would also be prudent would be to quickly open the BuildingEscape project.

42
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.900
It should open up in the version of Unreal it's associated with. which is 4.10

43
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.900
here. Make sure that we are exactly in the place we want to be. before we go

44
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.900
ahead and do our project upgrade. because you don't want to go upgrading a project in a state that's

45
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.900
not where you want to start from. So there it is. it's working

46
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.900
and it seems to be fine. OK great! So given

47
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.900
that that's where we're starting from. I'm going to write my commit message before I even

48
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.900
make this upgrade. because it's a very good habit actually to get into to write commit messages before

49
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900
you do your piece of work. Then. when you're deep into something you can think. what on Earth

50
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.900
am I doing? So this is very simply. "Upgrade

51
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.900
project to 4.12".

52
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.900
OK. I'm not going to commit that yet but that's what I intend to do. Now.

53
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.900
how do we get it to 4.12? What you're going to need to do. if you haven't already got 4.12.3

54
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.900
or later. you click Add Versions and it should come up in the list. but I don't want

55
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.900
that. so I'm just going to remove that. I've got 4.12.3 here. so if I go and

56
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.900
launch that. While it's launching. notice that these

57
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.900
other projects tell you the version number. 4.10. 4.11 OK.

58
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.900
So. the Editor's going to launch. then we're going to need to. in 4.12 open

59
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.900
BuildingEscape. Now. it's going to give you a choice. It was made with a different

60
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.900
version. do you want to convert it or open a copy? OK. well I want

61
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.900
to go to More Options and Convert in- place.

62
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.900
There's more options at the bottom-left than Convert in-place. Because I have this project under source

63
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.900
control. I'm not worried about it breaking it. The reason they're being cautious

64
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.900
is. if you were developing a larger game. you're a year or two into production Unreal drops a new

65
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.900
version. the last thing you want to do is just suddenly convert your project

66
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.900
without being very sure that it's going to work in the new system. It may create you

67
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.900
weeks or months of work do convert. so they are quite cautious about

68
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.900
upgrading. Normally. you would think very carefully before upgrading to a new major version.

69
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.900
half-way through a project. But I have it under source control here. it's a very small project.

70
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.900
so I'm going to convert this project in-place. as they call it.

71
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.900
If we look in source control. now that it's doing that. at the master branch.

72
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.900
we should probably see some changes on the disk already. We have. there's a bunch of

73
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.900
stuff here. Not much actually. hardly anything to be honest. it's just changed

74
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.900
the engine association there. which is the thing that determines which engine version it opens

75
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.900
with when it opens. and a few other things in the solution files.

76
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.900
So. let's check we're in 4.12. Help. About Unreal Editor. and you can see that

77
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.900
we are in 4.12. Great! Now let's just play the game. make sure that that behaves!

78
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.900
It does appear to. I'm just going to make sure I can pick things up.

79
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.900
drop them down. Play testing this game. of course. is very easy

80
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.900
because it's a very small game. There we go. and I can get out the door

81
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.900
and fall to my death. [Laughs] hardly worth the escape! OK. so it all looks

82
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.900
good! I'm going to close everything up! I already know what  my commit message is

83
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.900
going to be. so I stage my changes. go to Commit. there it is ready to go. and

84
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.900
I'm going to push that up to Origin. which means I've connected to Github and I'm just sending it

85
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.900
to the cloud. And that is that. that is that project

86
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.900
updated! Fantastic! So now. let's open the other. the next repository

87
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.900
along. which is going to be

88
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.900
BattleTank. because

89
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.900
Bulls and Cows was not an Unreal project. if you remember.

90
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.900
OK. so the last thing I did was Setting Up Projectiles. Again.

91
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.900
we have more state changes. since then. so I'm going to Stash those.

92
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.900
They go on the left-hand side. here on the Stashes. It means you're not throwing it away.

93
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.900
but you're immediately keeping it on the side. as it were. and you're then

94
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.900
able to continue your work from where you left off. So. this is the right

95
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.900
place to be. Now. we go to the EPIC Games Launcher. Launch for

96
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.900
12.3. Now. I'm expecting.

97
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.900
by the way. this BuildingEscape association to change here. I would think we may

98
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.900
need to just relaunch the EPIC Games Launcher for that to say 4.12. We'll check all that at the end.

99
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.900
So it's saying. what do I want to open? Well I'm saying I want to open

100
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.900
BattleTank. which is a 4.11 version game. I'm going to

101
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.900
click More Options and Convert in-place again. because we're under source

102
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.900
control. We're all good! Yes. that is an Oculus Rift logo we see over

103
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.900
there. Sorry if you're jealous but we have to have them. it's part of our work. We have to buy them. we have to

104
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.900
expense claim them. It's a terrible terrible thing that has to be done! We've got to

105
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.900
teach you guys VR somehow. In fact. 4.12 that we're using

106
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.900
now. not only is it very easy to preview your game in VR. which you could in

107
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.900
a previous version. but you can actually build levels in VR. I haven't got that working because

108
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.900
I haven't got the Oculus Touch hand controllers yet. but don't worry. the moment I have I'll be showing you

109
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.900
level building in VR. in Unreal. which is wicked!

110
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.900
Alright. so here comes 4.12.3

111
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.900
re-spooling up now with the project. And what we're going to be able to do is free up

112
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.900
about 20 or 30 gigabytes of disk space shortly. OK now. check

113
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.900
that you know which version you're in. About Unreal Editor 4.12. Cool!

114
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.900
Play the game. make sure that what we've got works. Fantastic!

115
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.900
Let's just go to the main menu. make sure we can play it from

116
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.900
there. Start! Ooh. what on Earth was that?!

117
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.900
There were tanks flying off into the distance. Did you see that?

118
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.900
That was quite a lot of fun! Those other tanks that we put down...

119
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.900
Boom. what is going on here?! So. [laughs] what's happened

120
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.900
is. we have upgraded to 4.12 but we have a couple of issues. so

121
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.900
before I go any further I'm just going to check that this blueprint actually opens.

122
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.900
because that was the point of doing this. It looks a bit funny. but if you click Open Full Blueprint

123
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.900
Editor all is good. OK. so what I'm going to do is. I'm going to commit

124
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.900
this upgrade now. because we have upgraded but we have an issue.

125
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.900
OK. so with Unreal closed I'm going to Commit and say upgrade to 4.12.

126
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.900


127
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.900
And I'm just going to say that the "tanks fly

128
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.900
off" and push that to master.

129
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.900
Actually. I won't push that to master. because master is my branch for this particular

130
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.900
this particular video. So actually. I'm going to hold off committing. but in your case.

131
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.900
you would probably want to commit at this stage. so that you can go back so that

132
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.900
while you work on the fix of the tanks flying off you can always roll back to this

133
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.900
bit. you don't have to keep re-upgrading your project. I hope that makes sense. But I'm just going to

134
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.900
not commit and just try and fix it in line like this. So.

135
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.900
why are our tanks flying off? My first suspicion about

136
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.900
why they're flying off. if I could open the right project. Let's do it from the EPIC Games Launcher.

137
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.900
Let's re-cycle this EPIC Games Launcher now. because it's making

138
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.900
me nervous that these are the wrong versions. So. if you just close and reopen the EPIC

139
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.900
Games Launcher. I would have thought that by the end of that

140
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.900
it will re-read those editor preferences or those

141
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.900
engine version files and actually update those thumbnails. Let's see if that's the case.

142
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.900
4.12 on both you see! So now.

143
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.900
by the way. you can remove these other engine version in the back here. 4.10.4

144
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.900
you can uninstall. and 4.11.2

145
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.900
you can uninstall. You need to do that with Unreal closed and I don't really need to show you that. but

146
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.900
the idea at the end of this will be to uninstall those versions. Alright. I'm going to guess that

147
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.900
these tanks fly off just because they're colliding in the start. so if I lift each tank just

148
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.900
a little bit further off the ground and try playing. what happens?

149
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.900
Ah fine. that's what it was! So there's slightly different collision tolerances or something

150
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.900
in 4.12 and that was causing them to fly off. So. if you just

151
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.900
move your tanks a bit. we've got some glitches now. You see them kind of funkily jumping

152
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.900
around. Well. we can sort those out in up coming videos. but

153
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.900
let's stick with this and commit it that we have [Laughs]

154
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.900
funky dancing tanks. but at least they're not flying off! So. that's good enough for this video.

155
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.900
thank you for watching. and I will see you in the next one. Your challenge to

156
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.900
leave you with is to upgrade both projects to 4.12. if you haven't done it already. Building

157
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.900
Escape. test and commit. BattleTank. test and commit. and then. remove your

158
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.900
previous versions of Unreal as I explained. Finally.

159
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.900
consider deleting other vault local content. Just to tell you what that is.

160
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.900
it's here in the EPIC Games Launcher. If you scroll down you've got Vault. and if you've got a

161
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.900
big demo project. you can click and Remove Local Content. All of this will free up

162
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.900
lots of space on your disk. So. I am going to close

163
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.900
Unreal. and I am going to start those

164
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.900
uninstalls going. You have to have Unreal

165
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.900
fully closed. There you go. And that's from the uninstall going

166
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.900
ahead. And do that same with 4.11.2. and I will see you in the next video!

167
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.533


=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello and welcome to Upgrading

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to Unreal 4.12. In fact, I need to update the top-right of these slides, moving forward,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to indicate that we will be using 4.12 from here on. So, that's what we're going to be

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
doing, upgrading to 4.12. We will also be removing our versions

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of 4.10 and 4.11, to free up lots of space on our disk,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,900
and upgrading both projects like this, so see you in there!

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,900
So, I don't know if this is happening for you, but when I open my projectile blueprint,

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,900
now since the end of the last video just a few minutes ago, the blueprint is not

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,900
working properly. It doesn't matter what I do with the menus, I can't get all of the blueprint information

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,900
up. It's not a general problem with the Blueprint Editor, because it is fine for the Tank.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,900
So, I've tried a few things to sort this out, and the thing that I found worked

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,900
most effectively was just opening the project in Unreal 4.12.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,900
So, that's what we're going to do, learn a little bit about source control and also upgrade all our projects

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,900
to Unreal 4.12. So, I'm going to start with Buidling

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,900
Escape. The first thing I want to do is, make sure that my current state

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,900
of my project on the disk is in the correct place, so I have some

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,900
what we call, uncommitted changes here. That means there are some changes to the

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,900
repository since I last worked on it, and the

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,900
head tells me what my current disk state is. So,

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,900
I'm checked out at applying materials, plus there are a few changes

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,900
since then. That's not what I want. I want, before I do my upgrade, to

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,900
start where I left off. Now, I left off on BE44, as I call it

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,900
the Section Wrap-Up video, then I just updated the readme file, so that's

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,900
where I want to be. An easy way to get there is to use something called stash. This Stash

25
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,900
button just saves all of these changes, so that you could get back to them

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,900
if you wanted to, and then, checks you out in the last place, which is

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,900
now the correct place. We are here, checked out

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,900
on master. If we just say Checkout Master to be sure, you can see now

29
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,900
that we are nearly at the top of master. What it's telling us here

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,900
is that, my current disk state is here at BE44,

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,900
but at origin, i.e. on my Remote repository which

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,900
is up on Github, I've updated a readme. So, what I

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,900
want to do to get there is, this little arrow here says I need to pull that down. That means I'm able

34
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,900
to change in another computer, and I haven't currently brought that down to you.

35
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Great! Now we're all in line, the master branch, the origin/

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,900
master, and the Head of origin I don't really care about. OK, so now my

37
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,900
local file system actually has this readme file in it. We could

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,900
just have a look at that, for instance. We could go to the repos,

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,900
we could go to BattleTank, back to our

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Unreal BuildingEscape, and there's the README.md

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,900
file. And what would also be prudent would be to quickly open the BuildingEscape project.

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,900
It should open up in the version of Unreal it's associated with, which is 4.10

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,900
here. Make sure that we are exactly in the place we want to be, before we go

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,900
ahead and do our project upgrade, because you don't want to go upgrading a project in a state that's

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,900
not where you want to start from. So there it is, it's working

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,900
and it seems to be fine. OK great! So given

47
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,900
that that's where we're starting from, I'm going to write my commit message before I even

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,900
make this upgrade, because it's a very good habit actually to get into to write commit messages before

49
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,900
you do your piece of work. Then, when you're deep into something you can think, what on Earth

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,900
am I doing? So this is very simply, "Upgrade

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,900
project to 4.12".

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,900
OK, I'm not going to commit that yet but that's what I intend to do. Now,

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,900
how do we get it to 4.12? What you're going to need to do, if you haven't already got 4.12.3

54
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,900
or later, you click Add Versions and it should come up in the list, but I don't want

55
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,900
that, so I'm just going to remove that. I've got 4.12.3 here, so if I go and

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,900
launch that. While it's launching, notice that these

57
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,900
other projects tell you the version number, 4.10, 4.11 OK.

58
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,900
So, the Editor's going to launch, then we're going to need to, in 4.12 open

59
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,900
BuildingEscape. Now, it's going to give you a choice. It was made with a different

60
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,900
version, do you want to convert it or open a copy? OK, well I want

61
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,900
to go to More Options and Convert in- place.

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,900
There's more options at the bottom-left than Convert in-place. Because I have this project under source

63
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,900
control, I'm not worried about it breaking it. The reason they're being cautious

64
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,900
is, if you were developing a larger game, you're a year or two into production Unreal drops a new

65
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,900
version, the last thing you want to do is just suddenly convert your project

66
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,900
without being very sure that it's going to work in the new system. It may create you

67
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,900
weeks or months of work do convert, so they are quite cautious about

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,900
upgrading. Normally, you would think very carefully before upgrading to a new major version,

69
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,900
half-way through a project. But I have it under source control here, it's a very small project,

70
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,900
so I'm going to convert this project in-place, as they call it.

71
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,900
If we look in source control, now that it's doing that, at the master branch,

72
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,900
we should probably see some changes on the disk already. We have, there's a bunch of

73
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,900
stuff here. Not much actually, hardly anything to be honest, it's just changed

74
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,900
the engine association there, which is the thing that determines which engine version it opens

75
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,900
with when it opens, and a few other things in the solution files.

76
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,900
So, let's check we're in 4.12. Help, About Unreal Editor, and you can see that

77
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,900
we are in 4.12. Great! Now let's just play the game, make sure that that behaves!

78
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,900
It does appear to, I'm just going to make sure I can pick things up,

79
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,900
drop them down. Play testing this game, of course, is very easy

80
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,900
because it's a very small game. There we go, and I can get out the door

81
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,900
and fall to my death, [Laughs] hardly worth the escape! OK, so it all looks

82
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,900
good! I'm going to close everything up! I already know what  my commit message is

83
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,900
going to be, so I stage my changes, go to Commit, there it is ready to go, and

84
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm going to push that up to Origin, which means I've connected to Github and I'm just sending it

85
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,900
to the cloud. And that is that, that is that project

86
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,900
updated! Fantastic! So now, let's open the other, the next repository

87
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,900
along, which is going to be

88
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,900
BattleTank, because

89
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Bulls and Cows was not an Unreal project, if you remember.

90
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,900
OK, so the last thing I did was Setting Up Projectiles. Again,

91
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,900
we have more state changes, since then, so I'm going to Stash those.

92
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,900
They go on the left-hand side, here on the Stashes. It means you're not throwing it away,

93
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,900
but you're immediately keeping it on the side, as it were, and you're then

94
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,900
able to continue your work from where you left off. So, this is the right

95
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,900
place to be. Now, we go to the EPIC Games Launcher. Launch for

96
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,900
12.3. Now, I'm expecting,

97
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,900
by the way, this BuildingEscape association to change here, I would think we may

98
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,900
need to just relaunch the EPIC Games Launcher for that to say 4.12. We'll check all that at the end.

99
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,900
So it's saying, what do I want to open? Well I'm saying I want to open

100
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,900
BattleTank, which is a 4.11 version game. I'm going to

101
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,900
click More Options and Convert in-place again, because we're under source

102
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,900
control. We're all good! Yes, that is an Oculus Rift logo we see over

103
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,900
there. Sorry if you're jealous but we have to have them, it's part of our work. We have to buy them, we have to

104
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,900
expense claim them. It's a terrible terrible thing that has to be done! We've got to

105
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,900
teach you guys VR somehow. In fact, 4.12 that we're using

106
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,900
now, not only is it very easy to preview your game in VR, which you could in

107
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,900
a previous version, but you can actually build levels in VR. I haven't got that working because

108
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,900
I haven't got the Oculus Touch hand controllers yet, but don't worry, the moment I have I'll be showing you

109
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,900
level building in VR, in Unreal, which is wicked!

110
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Alright, so here comes 4.12.3

111
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,900
re-spooling up now with the project. And what we're going to be able to do is free up

112
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,900
about 20 or 30 gigabytes of disk space shortly. OK now, check

113
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,900
that you know which version you're in. About Unreal Editor 4.12. Cool!

114
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Play the game, make sure that what we've got works. Fantastic!

115
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Let's just go to the main menu, make sure we can play it from

116
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,900
there. Start! Ooh, what on Earth was that?!

117
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,900
There were tanks flying off into the distance. Did you see that?

118
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,900
That was quite a lot of fun! Those other tanks that we put down...

119
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Boom, what is going on here?! So, [laughs] what's happened

120
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,900
is, we have upgraded to 4.12 but we have a couple of issues, so

121
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,900
before I go any further I'm just going to check that this blueprint actually opens,

122
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,900
because that was the point of doing this. It looks a bit funny, but if you click Open Full Blueprint

123
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Editor all is good. OK, so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to commit

124
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,900
this upgrade now, because we have upgraded but we have an issue.

125
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,900
OK, so with Unreal closed I'm going to Commit and say upgrade to 4.12.

126
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,900


127
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,900
And I'm just going to say that the "tanks fly

128
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,900
off" and push that to master.

129
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,900
Actually, I won't push that to master, because master is my branch for this particular

130
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,900
this particular video. So actually, I'm going to hold off committing, but in your case,

131
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,900
you would probably want to commit at this stage, so that you can go back so that

132
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,900
while you work on the fix of the tanks flying off you can always roll back to this

133
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,900
bit, you don't have to keep re-upgrading your project. I hope that makes sense. But I'm just going to

134
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,900
not commit and just try and fix it in line like this. So,

135
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,900
why are our tanks flying off? My first suspicion about

136
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,900
why they're flying off, if I could open the right project. Let's do it from the EPIC Games Launcher.

137
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Let's re-cycle this EPIC Games Launcher now, because it's making

138
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,900
me nervous that these are the wrong versions. So, if you just close and reopen the EPIC

139
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Games Launcher. I would have thought that by the end of that

140
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,900
it will re-read those editor preferences or those

141
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,900
engine version files and actually update those thumbnails. Let's see if that's the case.

142
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,900
4.12 on both you see! So now,

143
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,900
by the way, you can remove these other engine version in the back here. 4.10.4

144
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,900
you can uninstall, and 4.11.2

145
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,900
you can uninstall. You need to do that with Unreal closed and I don't really need to show you that, but

146
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,900
the idea at the end of this will be to uninstall those versions. Alright, I'm going to guess that

147
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,900
these tanks fly off just because they're colliding in the start, so if I lift each tank just

148
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,900
a little bit further off the ground and try playing, what happens?

149
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Ah fine, that's what it was! So there's slightly different collision tolerances or something

150
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,900
in 4.12 and that was causing them to fly off. So, if you just

151
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,900
move your tanks a bit, we've got some glitches now. You see them kind of funkily jumping

152
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,900
around. Well, we can sort those out in up coming videos, but

153
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,900
let's stick with this and commit it that we have [Laughs]

154
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,900
funky dancing tanks, but at least they're not flying off! So, that's good enough for this video,

155
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,900
thank you for watching, and I will see you in the next one. Your challenge to

156
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,900
leave you with is to upgrade both projects to 4.12, if you haven't done it already. Building

157
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Escape, test and commit, BattleTank, test and commit, and then, remove your

158
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,900
previous versions of Unreal as I explained. Finally,

159
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,900
consider deleting other vault local content. Just to tell you what that is,

160
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,900
it's here in the EPIC Games Launcher. If you scroll down you've got Vault, and if you've got a

161
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,900
big demo project, you can click and Remove Local Content. All of this will free up

162
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,900
lots of space on your disk. So, I am going to close

163
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,900
Unreal, and I am going to start those

164
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,900
uninstalls going. You have to have Unreal

165
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,900
fully closed. There you go. And that's from the uninstall going

166
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,900
ahead. And do that same with 4.11.2, and I will see you in the next video!

167
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,533
