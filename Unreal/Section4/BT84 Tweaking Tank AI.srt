00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey. and welcome to Tweaking Tank AI!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What we're going to do in this video is to simply prevent the tanks

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
from firing. the AI tanks from firing. until they're locked. And we're also

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
going to prevent them from getting any closer than about 80 meters away.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.733
so that they get to about 80 meters and then blow us out the water. [Laughs] OK! See you soon!

6
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:25.733
OK so let's get into improving a few things about this aiming. The

7
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:29.733
first thing you'll notice is that these AI tanks. they

8
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.733
fire off their weapons before they're actually locked. so let's start by

9
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.733
sorting that out. So ohh. it's gone a bit funny hasn't it?!

10
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.733
Oh. you know what I've done there. by the way. oh I've hit the

11
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.733
top-left key on the keyboard. above the Tab under the Escape and that

12
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.733
brings up the game console. which you may be familiar with from some Unreal game.

13
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:53.733
OK. so what we want to do then is. in the TankAIController

14
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:57.733
and the .cpp. instead of just firing.

15
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:01.733
what we want to do in pseudocode is say if... And then.

16
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:05.733
what is the state? The AimingComponent header file. Yeah.

17
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.733
if Aiming or Locked only is what we want. so let's just pseudocode that

18
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:13.733
in the tank... "// If aiming or locked"

19
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.733
then fire is what we want to do. OK. so how are we going to do that? Well we need to

20
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.733
be able to get this state from the AimingComponent

21
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:25.733
and. at the moment. we don't have a way doing that. Now don't just make this FiringState

22
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:29.733
public. that's naughty. because that would allow other classes to set the FiringState. and as

23
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:33.733
your project gets bigger that means you're likely to end up doing that by mistake. What we want to do is make

24
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.733
a nice safe void... Ah. not void! Very easy to

25
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:41.733
type void. isn't it? We want a method that returns the FiringState. so the return

26
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:45.733
type is EFiringState. and then. it's GetFiringState()

27
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:49.733
and then const because we don't want it changing any of the member variables. we're

28
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:53.733
just getting the FiringState. Let's go ahead and implement that. I'm going to use VisualStudio's

29
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.733
Create Definition tool. but if you're in Xcode then it's very easy to

30
00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:01.733
just go and write this over in the TankAimingComponent.cpp file.

31
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:05.733
So I'm just going to make sure that it's done it right. It kind of [Laughs] hasn't. it's

32
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:09.733
saying return an EFiringState() as a method. That's a bit weird. and it's not

33
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:13.733
EFiringState. it's FiringState. Remember the member variable in question

34
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.733
in the header file here is FiringState. so the implementation...

35
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:21.733
This is confusing for you Xcode guys. by the way. We're looking into the TankAiming

36
00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:25.733
Conponent.cpp here. we can't just go to the TankAimingComponent. Here it is. there's a getter! In fact.

37
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:29.733
I'm going to move that getter further up the class. because I think it should be

38
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:33.733
probably. something like. after. it doesn't really matter. after Tick. something

39
00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:37.733
like that. OK. so it's a very simple const method

40
00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:41.733
that returns the FiringState. Now that we've got that getter method.

41
00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:45.733
in the TankAIController. we can ask this question. "// if aim or locked".

42
00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:49.733
We can actually ask it in code. if (Aiming

43
00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:53.733
Component. because that's the thing that knows. GetFiringState()

44
00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:57.733
== EFiringState

45
00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:01.733
:: because it's a static.

46
00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:05.733
In this case. it's an enum but it's known at compile time. that's when you use your colon

47
00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:09.733
colons. If it's Locked. that's the only time. actually. we want

48
00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:13.733
this AI tank to fire. and we'll worry about limiting the firing rate later.

49
00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:17.733
Does that make sense? Let's have a go! We're simply saying to the AI

50
00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:21.733
tanks. don't fire until you're locked. you crazy fools! Now let's see if they

51
00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:25.733
actually get locked. This is going to depend somewhat on the

52
00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:29.733
AcceptanceRadius. that we have in the TankAimingComponent. Do you remember this

53
00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:33.733
here? This AcceptanceRadius is very small. It may be that they never quite get locked. but

54
00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:37.733
let's see what happens. I'm going to go F11. go down the hill a little bit.

55
00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:41.733
to where I can see them. Boom! Yeah oh. they definitely got

56
00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:45.733
locked. [Laughs] O.K. No worries about them getting locked! But what they are doing

57
00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:49.733
is getting. I think. too close. They're kind of crazy cheeky close. right now!

58
00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:53.733
So are they aiming the right way? Let's just check that. They do appear to be.

59
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.733
Is this guy going to shoot me? He's not locked.

60
00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:01.733
He doesn't want to think that he's locked either. You know why this probably is? It's probably because they're

61
00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:05.733
trying to aim at the bottom half of... Remember that the only thing they can aim at. at the moment. is the

62
00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:09.733
tank route i.e. it's origin. and they probably couldn't quite

63
00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:13.733
get their barrels low enough but the point is. they shouldn't be getting that close in the first place.

64
00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:17.733
So that's what we're going to tackle now. in the second half of the video. So.

65
00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:21.733
so far. as a recap. what we have done is we have

66
00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:25.733
written a getter and then implemented it. which was super simple on the TankAimingComponent and

67
00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:29.733
then. just said to the AI Controller. only fire when locked. Very very simple. it

68
00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:33.733
reads almost like English. Now we're going to look at the AcceptanceRadius. So

69
00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:37.733
not that but in the... Where is the AcceptanceRadius? It'll be in the Tank

70
00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:41.733
AIController. We have an AcceptanceRadius here.

71
00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:45.733
If you go to the header file of the TankAIController.

72
00:04:45.733 --> 00:04:49.733
remember the AcceptanceRadius is how close the tank AI can get. Well what I want to

73
00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:53.733
do is. I want to expose this to a blueprint. but we don't even have a blueprint for it. at the moment.

74
00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:57.733
so you're going to do it. Here's your challenge! I want you to make a blueprint of the TankAI

75
00:04:57.733 --> 00:05:01.733
Controller class. See if you can remember how to do that. over in the Editor. Then. I want you

76
00:05:01.733 --> 00:05:05.733
to expose AcceptanceRadius as EditAnywhere.

77
00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:09.733
at least for now. You could make it edit default only. but let's go EditAnywhere to start

78
00:05:09.733 --> 00:05:13.733
with. You'll see why. Code your default AcceptanceRadius. once you find it. So

79
00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:17.733
explore it in the Editor. You may want to depossess the tank. play around with some AcceptanceRadiuses. see

80
00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:21.733
how many meters. Remember that it's got two extra 0's on it. so 7.000 would mean

81
00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:25.733
70 meters. And then. put the default back into C++. place your AI

82
00:05:25.733 --> 00:05:29.733
tanks in the world. and remember that if you do place your AI tanks for your

83
00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:33.733
player outside the Navmesh. then you may need to refresh your Navmesh.

84
00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:37.733
Currently. my Navmesh is only a subset of the whole terrain. so I'll probably expand that out as well.

85
00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:41.733
because if you go off the Navmesh. things will stop moving. OK. so pause the video and have a go at that

86
00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:45.733
challenge now!

87
00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:47.333


88
00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:51.333
OK guys. let's get this done! This will be

89
00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:55.333
a bit of fun. sort of. OK. so how do we do it? We go to the C++

90
00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:59.333
Classes folder. of our Content browser.  We go find

91
00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:03.333
ourselves the Tank AI Controller. right-click it. and then. say Create Blueprint class based on

92
00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:07.333
Tank AIController. There it is! So I'm going to call it TankAIController_

93
00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:11.333
BP. because that's how we like to name things and create it. There it is!

94
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:15.333
Now. just straight away. I'm going to put it in the Blueprints folder. just to keep the other one that's in there

95
00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:19.333
company and to be tidy. So here it is! It doesn't do anything. it doesn't need to do anything

96
00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:23.333
yet. but we are going to expose a property. So let's go ahead and do that! I'm going to move. of

97
00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:27.333
course. this AcceptanceRadius. into the protected section of the class. Why?

98
00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:31.333
Because the blueprint is a... Hold on. I can't talk and type at the same

99
00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:35.333
time. I can usually but I can't right now. The blueprint

100
00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:39.333
is a child class of the C++ class. In fact. you can

101
00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:43.333
see that in the blueprint. It says Parent Class is the Tank AIController. So

102
00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:47.333
that's exactly what protected means. it means the children can read it. So let's make this a

103
00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:51.333
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) for now.

104
00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:55.333
And then. I'm going to go

105
00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:59.333
category = "Setup" in strings. And

106
00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:03.333
I'm going to make a note. straight away. that "// Consider DefaultsEdit

107
00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:07.333
Only". EditDefaultsOnly. If I actually put the word

108
00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:11.333
exactly like that. then I could always copy and paste it later. That's the handy thing about writing the actual

109
00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:15.333
code there. but you wouldn't normally write full coding comments. The whole point of comments

110
00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:19.333
is that you can use English. But in this case. if I'm saying I might change this code for this

111
00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:23.333
code. then it make sense to put it so that I could copy and paste it later. OK

112
00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:27.333
so that's now exposed. Let's go have a little compile and

113
00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:31.333
watch the TankAIController blueprint. as we do so. And what I'm

114
00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:35.333
hoping will happen. I could collapse some of these categories down. is a Setup category will magically

115
00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:39.333
appear in here. and we will be. there you go. able to set an Acceptance

116
00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:43.333
Radius. So let's try an AcceptanceRadius of 150

117
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:47.333
meters. Compile. play. I love how fast you can compile blueprints. of course.

118
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:51.333
And let's make ourselves larger and see

119
00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:55.333
how far away that is. Now they're not

120
00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:59.333
moving. Yeah. they're coming towards us. I don't know. difficult to say! Difficult to

121
00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:03.333
say. when they're shooting the daylights out of us like this. So why don't we

122
00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:07.333
make it nearly impossible for them to shoot us. just temporarily. or we could even

123
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:11.333
take the TankAimingComponent off. The problem with that is. it's a little bit

124
00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:15.333
tricky to do. So what's the easiest way of disabling this thing?

125
00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:19.333
Well one thing would be to give them a pitiful launch speed of maybe 10 but remember what you

126
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:23.333
had first. I think it was 20.000. So

127
00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:27.333
OK. let's try again! The point here is that I want to be able to see how

128
00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:31.333
close they can get. and I can't do that all the time that they are shooting

129
00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:35.333
me. So what you can do with this Edit...

130
00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:39.333
Hmm. it doesn't seem to be holding there? They seem to be pretty close. so let's just

131
00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:43.333
depossess with F8. click on this tank... Although. remember

132
00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:47.333
it's not the tank that's controlling this. it's AIController. which must be that

133
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:51.333
one. That AIController went for the left tank and that one for the right tank. the AIController hasn't moved

134
00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:55.333
in the world. But if you look at the AIController. then you can see the Acceptance

135
00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:59.333
Radius. down there. is 3.000 on that one. So what you're going to have to do

136
00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:03.333
is to tweak these things. actually. at runtime. So let's try

137
00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:07.333
150.000. Then. I can repossess my tank. get back into

138
00:09:07.333 --> 00:09:11.333
it. and then. drive off and see at what point does that tank.

139
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:15.333
whose AIController I just edited. start chasing us.

140
00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:19.333
Keep going.

141
00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:23.333
It doesn't seem to be chasing me

142
00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:27.333
at all. What's wrong with him? Oh yes he is. there he is! OK. so the point is. that's too far away!

143
00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:31.333
So I can go F8. I can click on this. I can pause the game even. click on the

144
00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:35.333
controller in question. that one there. Try 80

145
00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:39.333
meters. 8000.

146
00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:43.333
and then. I could resume the game and see if 80 meters

147
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:47.333
looks reasonable. Now remember. they won't necessarily stop exactly where you ask them to.

148
00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:51.333
because they are going to overshoot. right. especially if they're going that fast.

149
00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:55.333
So another way of seeing is. I move away from him and see when he starts moving.

150
00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:59.333
Is this a reasonable place for the tank to get to? Yeah. that's

151
00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:03.333
probably about right for the enemy tank. We want it to stop around there and

152
00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:07.333
shoot at us. Cool! So we have our value. that's how we discovered our value!

153
00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:11.333
So it's not 150 meters but it's

154
00:10:11.333 --> 00:10:15.333
80 meters. So now we can make things simpler again. We can go back to the C++. we can

155
00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:19.333
code this in here. 80 meters. I will change it to EditDefault

156
00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:23.333
Only and recompile. And then. what you'll

157
00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:27.333
find will happen with EditDefaultOnly is that the actual instance of the

158
00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:31.333
AIController will no longer have that value on it. and the only place that you'll be able to

159
00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:35.333
change it is in a sensible place. which is the TankAIController's AcceptanceRadius over here.

160
00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:39.333
OK. so let's have a look!

161
00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:43.333
In fact. we've still got that as 150. so that's going to override the blueprint.

162
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:47.333
so I'm going to set it to 80 in here as well. The point of the C++ value

163
00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:51.333
is that. if we make a new TankAIController blueprint.

164
00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:55.333
then that's the value it's going to default to. so we want to

165
00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:59.333
put the value in here that we want. right. So C++

166
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:03.333
determines what the default in this box is. and then. this box determines what actually

167
00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:07.333
happens in the game play. if that makes sense. So 80 meters is what we're going for.

168
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:11.333
And we'll just save everything.

169
00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:15.333
play the game. make sure it's OK. and then. hopefully we

170
00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:19.333
have made the improvements we want to. which is that they don't fire until they're locked

171
00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:23.333
and that they stop about 80 meters away. Cool! I just need to re-enable the

172
00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:27.333
tank's firing. So instead of being at a launch at 4.000.

173
00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:31.333
let's put it back to 10 meters per second. Let's put it back under the

174
00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:35.333
TankAimingComponent of the tank blueprint. to 4.000.

175
00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:39.333
which is 40 meters a second which is about 100 miles an hour. It's pretty slow.

176
00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:43.333
actually. for a projectile. of course. but that's fine for now. while we're still using these beach balls. We'll

177
00:11:43.333 --> 00:11:47.333
create our projectiles shortly. Let's just see how this is! Can I shoot them? It's difficult

178
00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:51.333
actually. Ahh. I missed. of course. because the projectile's so slow. but they can certainly shoot me.

179
00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:55.333
and they don't crowd me. they don't get too close. So I'm much happier with that. and I

180
00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:59.333
will see you in the next video! If you're

181
00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:03.333
still with me. then I just want to leave the code changes on the screen for you. That is the Tank

182
00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:07.333
AIController C++. The AimingComponent is just

183
00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:11.333
the getter. and remember you can always go to GitHub to get the code state. So

184
00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:14.133
I will see you soon!

=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey, and welcome to Tweaking Tank AI!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What we're going to do in this video is to simply prevent the tanks

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
from firing, the AI tanks from firing, until they're locked. And we're also

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
going to prevent them from getting any closer than about 80 meters away,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,733
so that they get to about 80 meters and then blow us out the water. [Laughs] OK! See you soon!

6
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:25,733
OK so let's get into improving a few things about this aiming. The

7
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:29,733
first thing you'll notice is that these AI tanks, they

8
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:33,733
fire off their weapons before they're actually locked, so let's start by

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,733
sorting that out. So ohh, it's gone a bit funny hasn't it?!

10
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,733
Oh, you know what I've done there, by the way, oh I've hit the

11
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,733
top-left key on the keyboard, above the Tab under the Escape and that

12
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:49,733
brings up the game console, which you may be familiar with from some Unreal game.

13
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,733
OK, so what we want to do then is, in the TankAIController

14
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:57,733
and the .cpp, instead of just firing,

15
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:01,733
what we want to do in pseudocode is say if... And then,

16
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:05,733
what is the state? The AimingComponent header file. Yeah,

17
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,733
if Aiming or Locked only is what we want, so let's just pseudocode that

18
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:13,733
in the tank... "// If aiming or locked"

19
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,733
then fire is what we want to do. OK, so how are we going to do that? Well we need to

20
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:21,733
be able to get this state from the AimingComponent

21
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:25,733
and, at the moment, we don't have a way doing that. Now don't just make this FiringState

22
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:29,733
public, that's naughty, because that would allow other classes to set the FiringState, and as

23
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:33,733
your project gets bigger that means you're likely to end up doing that by mistake. What we want to do is make

24
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:37,733
a nice safe void... Ah, not void! Very easy to

25
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:41,733
type void, isn't it? We want a method that returns the FiringState, so the return

26
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:45,733
type is EFiringState, and then, it's GetFiringState()

27
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:49,733
and then const because we don't want it changing any of the member variables, we're

28
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:53,733
just getting the FiringState. Let's go ahead and implement that. I'm going to use VisualStudio's

29
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:57,733
Create Definition tool, but if you're in Xcode then it's very easy to

30
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:01,733
just go and write this over in the TankAimingComponent.cpp file.

31
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:05,733
So I'm just going to make sure that it's done it right. It kind of [Laughs] hasn't, it's

32
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:09,733
saying return an EFiringState() as a method. That's a bit weird, and it's not

33
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:13,733
EFiringState, it's FiringState. Remember the member variable in question

34
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17,733
in the header file here is FiringState, so the implementation...

35
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:21,733
This is confusing for you Xcode guys, by the way. We're looking into the TankAiming

36
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:25,733
Conponent.cpp here, we can't just go to the TankAimingComponent. Here it is, there's a getter! In fact,

37
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:29,733
I'm going to move that getter further up the class, because I think it should be

38
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,733
probably, something like, after, it doesn't really matter, after Tick, something

39
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:37,733
like that. OK, so it's a very simple const method

40
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:41,733
that returns the FiringState. Now that we've got that getter method,

41
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:45,733
in the TankAIController, we can ask this question, "// if aim or locked".

42
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:49,733
We can actually ask it in code, if (Aiming

43
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:53,733
Component, because that's the thing that knows. GetFiringState()

44
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:57,733
== EFiringState

45
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:01,733
:: because it's a static.

46
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:05,733
In this case, it's an enum but it's known at compile time. that's when you use your colon

47
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:09,733
colons. If it's Locked, that's the only time, actually, we want

48
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:13,733
this AI tank to fire, and we'll worry about limiting the firing rate later.

49
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,733
Does that make sense? Let's have a go! We're simply saying to the AI

50
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:21,733
tanks, don't fire until you're locked, you crazy fools! Now let's see if they

51
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,733
actually get locked. This is going to depend somewhat on the

52
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:29,733
AcceptanceRadius, that we have in the TankAimingComponent. Do you remember this

53
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:33,733
here? This AcceptanceRadius is very small. It may be that they never quite get locked, but

54
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:37,733
let's see what happens. I'm going to go F11, go down the hill a little bit,

55
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:41,733
to where I can see them. Boom! Yeah oh, they definitely got

56
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:45,733
locked. [Laughs] O.K. No worries about them getting locked! But what they are doing

57
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:49,733
is getting, I think, too close. They're kind of crazy cheeky close, right now!

58
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:53,733
So are they aiming the right way? Let's just check that. They do appear to be.

59
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,733
Is this guy going to shoot me? He's not locked.

60
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:01,733
He doesn't want to think that he's locked either. You know why this probably is? It's probably because they're

61
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:05,733
trying to aim at the bottom half of... Remember that the only thing they can aim at, at the moment, is the

62
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:09,733
tank route i.e. it's origin, and they probably couldn't quite

63
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:13,733
get their barrels low enough but the point is, they shouldn't be getting that close in the first place.

64
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:17,733
So that's what we're going to tackle now, in the second half of the video. So,

65
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:21,733
so far, as a recap, what we have done is we have

66
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:25,733
written a getter and then implemented it, which was super simple on the TankAimingComponent and

67
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:29,733
then, just said to the AI Controller, only fire when locked. Very very simple, it

68
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:33,733
reads almost like English. Now we're going to look at the AcceptanceRadius. So

69
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:37,733
not that but in the... Where is the AcceptanceRadius? It'll be in the Tank

70
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:41,733
AIController. We have an AcceptanceRadius here.

71
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:45,733
If you go to the header file of the TankAIController,

72
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:49,733
remember the AcceptanceRadius is how close the tank AI can get. Well what I want to

73
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:53,733
do is, I want to expose this to a blueprint, but we don't even have a blueprint for it, at the moment,

74
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:57,733
so you're going to do it. Here's your challenge! I want you to make a blueprint of the TankAI

75
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:01,733
Controller class. See if you can remember how to do that, over in the Editor. Then, I want you

76
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:05,733
to expose AcceptanceRadius as EditAnywhere,

77
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,733
at least for now. You could make it edit default only, but let's go EditAnywhere to start

78
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,733
with. You'll see why. Code your default AcceptanceRadius, once you find it. So

79
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,733
explore it in the Editor. You may want to depossess the tank, play around with some AcceptanceRadiuses, see

80
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:21,733
how many meters. Remember that it's got two extra 0's on it, so 7,000 would mean

81
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:25,733
70 meters. And then, put the default back into C++, place your AI

82
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:29,733
tanks in the world, and remember that if you do place your AI tanks for your

83
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:33,733
player outside the Navmesh, then you may need to refresh your Navmesh.

84
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,733
Currently, my Navmesh is only a subset of the whole terrain, so I'll probably expand that out as well,

85
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:41,733
because if you go off the Navmesh, things will stop moving. OK, so pause the video and have a go at that

86
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:45,733
challenge now!

87
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,333


88
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,333
OK guys, let's get this done! This will be

89
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:55,333
a bit of fun, sort of. OK, so how do we do it? We go to the C++

90
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:59,333
Classes folder, of our Content browser.  We go find

91
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:03,333
ourselves the Tank AI Controller, right-click it, and then, say Create Blueprint class based on

92
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:07,333
Tank AIController. There it is! So I'm going to call it TankAIController_

93
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,333
BP, because that's how we like to name things and create it. There it is!

94
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,333
Now, just straight away, I'm going to put it in the Blueprints folder, just to keep the other one that's in there

95
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,333
company and to be tidy. So here it is! It doesn't do anything, it doesn't need to do anything

96
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:23,333
yet, but we are going to expose a property. So let's go ahead and do that! I'm going to move, of

97
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,333
course, this AcceptanceRadius, into the protected section of the class. Why?

98
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,333
Because the blueprint is a... Hold on, I can't talk and type at the same

99
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,333
time. I can usually but I can't right now. The blueprint

100
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,333
is a child class of the C++ class. In fact, you can

101
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,333
see that in the blueprint. It says Parent Class is the Tank AIController. So

102
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:47,333
that's exactly what protected means, it means the children can read it. So let's make this a

103
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,333
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) for now.

104
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,333
And then, I'm going to go

105
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,333
category = "Setup" in strings. And

106
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,333
I'm going to make a note, straight away, that "// Consider DefaultsEdit

107
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,333
Only". EditDefaultsOnly. If I actually put the word

108
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,333
exactly like that, then I could always copy and paste it later. That's the handy thing about writing the actual

109
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,333
code there, but you wouldn't normally write full coding comments. The whole point of comments

110
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,333
is that you can use English. But in this case, if I'm saying I might change this code for this

111
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,333
code, then it make sense to put it so that I could copy and paste it later. OK

112
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,333
so that's now exposed. Let's go have a little compile and

113
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,333
watch the TankAIController blueprint, as we do so. And what I'm

114
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:35,333
hoping will happen, I could collapse some of these categories down, is a Setup category will magically

115
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,333
appear in here, and we will be, there you go, able to set an Acceptance

116
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,333
Radius. So let's try an AcceptanceRadius of 150

117
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,333
meters. Compile, play. I love how fast you can compile blueprints, of course.

118
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,333
And let's make ourselves larger and see

119
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,333
how far away that is. Now they're not

120
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:59,333
moving. Yeah, they're coming towards us. I don't know, difficult to say! Difficult to

121
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:03,333
say, when they're shooting the daylights out of us like this. So why don't we

122
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,333
make it nearly impossible for them to shoot us, just temporarily, or we could even

123
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,333
take the TankAimingComponent off. The problem with that is, it's a little bit

124
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:15,333
tricky to do. So what's the easiest way of disabling this thing?

125
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,333
Well one thing would be to give them a pitiful launch speed of maybe 10 but remember what you

126
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,333
had first. I think it was 20,000. So

127
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,333
OK, let's try again! The point here is that I want to be able to see how

128
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,333
close they can get, and I can't do that all the time that they are shooting

129
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,333
me. So what you can do with this Edit...

130
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,333
Hmm, it doesn't seem to be holding there? They seem to be pretty close, so let's just

131
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:43,333
depossess with F8, click on this tank... Although, remember

132
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,333
it's not the tank that's controlling this, it's AIController, which must be that

133
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,333
one. That AIController went for the left tank and that one for the right tank. the AIController hasn't moved

134
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,333
in the world. But if you look at the AIController, then you can see the Acceptance

135
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,333
Radius, down there, is 3,000 on that one. So what you're going to have to do

136
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,333
is to tweak these things, actually, at runtime. So let's try

137
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,333
150,000. Then, I can repossess my tank, get back into

138
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:11,333
it, and then, drive off and see at what point does that tank,

139
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,333
whose AIController I just edited, start chasing us.

140
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,333
Keep going.

141
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,333
It doesn't seem to be chasing me

142
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:27,333
at all. What's wrong with him? Oh yes he is, there he is! OK, so the point is, that's too far away!

143
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,333
So I can go F8, I can click on this, I can pause the game even, click on the

144
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,333
controller in question, that one there. Try 80

145
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,333
meters, 8000,

146
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:43,333
and then, I could resume the game and see if 80 meters

147
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,333
looks reasonable. Now remember, they won't necessarily stop exactly where you ask them to,

148
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,333
because they are going to overshoot, right, especially if they're going that fast.

149
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:55,333
So another way of seeing is, I move away from him and see when he starts moving.

150
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:59,333
Is this a reasonable place for the tank to get to? Yeah, that's

151
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,333
probably about right for the enemy tank. We want it to stop around there and

152
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:07,333
shoot at us. Cool! So we have our value, that's how we discovered our value!

153
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:11,333
So it's not 150 meters but it's

154
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,333
80 meters. So now we can make things simpler again. We can go back to the C++, we can

155
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:19,333
code this in here, 80 meters. I will change it to EditDefault

156
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:23,333
Only and recompile. And then, what you'll

157
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,333
find will happen with EditDefaultOnly is that the actual instance of the

158
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,333
AIController will no longer have that value on it, and the only place that you'll be able to

159
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:35,333
change it is in a sensible place, which is the TankAIController's AcceptanceRadius over here.

160
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:39,333
OK, so let's have a look!

161
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,333
In fact, we've still got that as 150, so that's going to override the blueprint,

162
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,333
so I'm going to set it to 80 in here as well. The point of the C++ value

163
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,333
is that, if we make a new TankAIController blueprint,

164
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,333
then that's the value it's going to default to, so we want to

165
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:59,333
put the value in here that we want, right. So C++

166
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:03,333
determines what the default in this box is, and then, this box determines what actually

167
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,333
happens in the game play, if that makes sense. So 80 meters is what we're going for.

168
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,333
And we'll just save everything,

169
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:15,333
play the game, make sure it's OK, and then, hopefully we

170
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:19,333
have made the improvements we want to, which is that they don't fire until they're locked

171
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:23,333
and that they stop about 80 meters away. Cool! I just need to re-enable the

172
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,333
tank's firing. So instead of being at a launch at 4,000,

173
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:31,333
let's put it back to 10 meters per second. Let's put it back under the

174
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,333
TankAimingComponent of the tank blueprint, to 4,000,

175
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,333
which is 40 meters a second which is about 100 miles an hour. It's pretty slow,

176
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:43,333
actually, for a projectile, of course, but that's fine for now, while we're still using these beach balls. We'll

177
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:47,333
create our projectiles shortly. Let's just see how this is! Can I shoot them? It's difficult

178
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,333
actually. Ahh, I missed, of course, because the projectile's so slow, but they can certainly shoot me,

179
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:55,333
and they don't crowd me, they don't get too close. So I'm much happier with that, and I

180
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:59,333
will see you in the next video! If you're

181
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,333
still with me, then I just want to leave the code changes on the screen for you. That is the Tank

182
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,333
AIController C++. The AimingComponent is just

183
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:11,333
the getter, and remember you can always go to GitHub to get the code state. So

184
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,133
I will see you soon!
