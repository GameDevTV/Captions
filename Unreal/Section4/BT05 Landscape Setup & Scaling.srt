
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
OK, so welcome to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Landscape Setup & Scaling. What we're going to be doing in this video is looking at the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
impact of scale on our landscapes, and eventually building ourselves a 1 by 1 kilometer

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
terrain like this, that's going to have detail down to the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
half meter scale in it. And the lighting will be built so that it looks

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
clean like this, and we'll be making sure that we can preview at a reasonable

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
performance, including using something called a Light Mass Importance Volume,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which you can see in the middle here, which is just a little hack to get the lighting to build faster.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,966
So, let's dive in and talk about terrain scale!

10
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:38,966
So, we really want to think about the scale of the landscape now. So, I'm going to demonstrate

11
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:42,966
a few things with some dramatic different scales, so you can see the effect,

12
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:46,966
and then, I'll put you into a challenge where you can generate your landscape. So, just watch along for now, and I'll

13
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:50,966
explain my thinking. So, what's going on? What are we seeing on the screen? We're seeing little squares.

14
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,966
Now these little squares are called quads. They're quads because they have four vertices,

15
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:58,966
and they happen to be squares at this point. Although, as soon as we start deforming the terrain, they

16
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:02,966
actually deviate from squares. We'll see that in a moment. The scale

17
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:06,966
relates to the size of those squares. If I made that 1,000 in the X,

18
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,966
it will automatically change the Y, by the way, because it wants to keep the

19
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:14,966
quads square, rather than long rectangles. Now the terrain is

20
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:18,966
ten times larger. So, what this is saying to us is,

21
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:22,966
we have a section size of 63 by 63

22
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:26,966
quads. So, if I was to turn that down to 7 by 7, you could see it, the 7

23
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:30,966
by 7 in each section. OK, a section is

24
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,966
also known as a component, so

25
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:38,966
the component, there are 8 by 8 components at the moment just like a chess

26
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,966
board, if you look along. The large squares are 8 by 8, so there are 64 large squares,

27
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:46,966
each of which has 49 or 7 by 7 inside.

28
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:50,966
So, how big is the terrain overall? Well, the scale is what sets

29
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,966
that. Again, if I set that down to 100, it gets ten times smaller. At 1,000

30
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:58,966
it gets ten times larger. At 1,000 we're saying, it's 1,000 centimeters

31
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:02,966
per quad, so it is

32
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:06,966
10 meters per quad. Alright, now you don't have to do the calculation yourself.

33
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:10,966
The 7 by 7 or the 7 by 8 is 57 here.

34
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:14,966
There's an off by one error but it's close enough. So, it's 57

35
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:18,966
by 57 squares, each square of which is 10 meters

36
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:22,966
or 1,000 centimeters. So, it's 570 by 570 meters

37
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:26,966
this terrain. Let's try creating it at this scale and see what the impact is!

38
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:30,966
So, I'm going to create it at this scale, and then, I'm going to just do some stuff with the brush.

39
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:34,966
OK, then we're just going to go into the world by playing and have a look.

40
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:38,966
Now, these squares on the floor are 10 by 10 meters, 33

41
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:42,966
by 33 feet, and that is the maximum resolution to which we can

42
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:46,966
adjust the terrain. So, if we look around very closely...

43
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,966
By the way, these strange effects we get in between the big lines, that's just the fact that the lighting

44
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:54,966
hasn't been built. So, if we look these are the quads, you can see them here.

45
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,966
What it is, when it's deformed, is it is four vertices. Let me just go to

46
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:02,966
a different tool. You can see in the square in front of me, that there's four

47
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:06,966
vertices, but they're bent in the middle. So it's two triangles. Basically a quad is

48
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:10,966
two triangles, and that's how it meshes them all together.

49
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:14,966
Now, if we're 10 by 10 size blocks, then it gives a very jagged outlook

50
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:18,966
to all of the terrain, because the maximum or the minimum size at which we

51
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,966
can adjust anything is these 10 by 10 blocks. The most that we can do is kind of pull up the middle of one of these

52
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:26,966
10 by 10 blocks, to create a sharp effect like you see in some of

53
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:30,966
these quads, if you know what you're looking for. Here a lot of them are flat, called Planer Quads.

54
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:34,966
Like here, these guys are flat, and then, these quads are bent down the middle.

55
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,966
It's a little bit tricky to see, but if you look closely, you'll see that there are

56
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:42,966
two triangles butted up against each other. Alright, so that's one extreme! I'm going to delete that

57
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:46,966
landscape. The disadvantage of that is, we can't quite get enough detail

58
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:50,966
in our landscape, and our hill outlines look very jagged.

59
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:54,966
So, let's go right down to another extreme, and just say, well how about we have 10 centimeter quads!

60
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:58,966
What's the problem with that? Well, one of the problems with that is that your landscape ends up

61
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:02,966
very very small, and you need a lot of sections and a lot of

62
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:06,966
quads per section to even get a reasonable sized landscape. Now, we have a landscape which

63
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:10,966
has an overall resolution of about 2,000 by 2,000. 2,000 by

64
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:14,966
2,000 what? 10 centimeter blocks. So, it's 200 by 200

65
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:18,966
meters only. Now, let's create it!

66
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,966
Sculpt it a little bit with a much smaller tool this time, because it's related to the

67
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:26,966
size of these quads. I'm getting really fast action on this

68
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,966
now. You can kind of see that this is not exactly the

69
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:34,966
scale that the tool is setup for. Now, if I go in and have a look at it,

70
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:38,966
what we see is look at this amount of detail! It's huge, because

71
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:42,966
each of these little squares is only 10 by 10 centimeters. It's almost too

72
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:46,966
much, you're almost getting artifacts or noise from it. Now, the advantage is

73
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:50,966
massively more detail. Look how smooth the hill outlines are! The disadvantage

74
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:54,966
is, you're actually going to hit a maximum terrain size like this! Let me show you!

75
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:58,966
If we delete the landscape, and let's go back and say, OK we're going to mandate

76
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,966
a 10 by 10 centimeter and we're going to hit Fill World. How big does it get? Well,

77
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:06,966
it's already as big as it can get. The maximum number of components we can have is 32 by 32.

78
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:10,966
OK, so that's what Fill World does, it just maximizes the number of components.

79
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:14,966
You could turn the selection size up in quads, and that would make the world

80
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:18,966
effectively larger, until you get to that 8196 by 8196

81
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:22,966
maximum OK. But that's 8,000 by 8,000

82
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:26,966
10 centimeter blocks, so only 800 by 800 meters. It's not even a

83
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:30,966
kilometer square and we've hit Unreal's maximum. So this

84
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:34,966
is one of the principle reasons you don't want to use such a small tile size, is you're not going to be able to

85
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:38,100
make a reasonably large city scale terrain like that.

86
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,100
So, just before I challenge you to create a terrain of a specific

87
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,100
size, I just want to show you a handy trick, which is, of course, that you could place in the scene

88
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,100
a cube for example. Now, if we

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,100
just drop that in the scene, set it to the origin,

90
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,100
go look at it, and then, say to ourselves, well how big is this cube? Well, they

91
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,100
are 1 by 1 meter, as standard,100 by 100 centimeters.

92
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,100
So if I scale this cube to say 1,000 on the X

93
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,100
axis and maybe 10 meters wide, then we have a kilometer

94
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,100
long cube. I could zoom out to see that, and back at the

95
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,100
landscape creation tool, you can still see this cube if I

96
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,100
zoom out. Remember that when you're trying to move around in the

97
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,100
W, S, A, D regime while holding the Right Mouse Button, you can use the

98
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,733
Mouse Wheel to change the speed that you move, so rolling the Mouse Wheel up or down will change your movements.

99
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:34,100
So here we see this 1 kilometer by 10 meter

100
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,100
long rod, and then, we can corroborate that with the fact that the landscape

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,100
is 8,000 by 8,000, 10 by 10 centimeter blocks. So, the landscape

102
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,100
is 800 meters and the rod is 1,000. So, that look about right.

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,100
OK, so that's quite a cool way of helping you scale. Alright, your challenge!

104
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,100
The way that you'll bring all of this together and really understand how the scale relates

105
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,100
to the overall resolution, etc. is by trying to get a specific landscape

106
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,100
to a specific spec that I'm going to give you, so I want you to create your own landscape.

107
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Make it about 1,000 meters square. I say about because

108
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,100
we're dealing with powers of 2 here. Make each quad half a

109
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,100
meter in size. We're going to go for a compromise, a little bit more detail than we would have at

110
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,100
a 1 meter size. Use 8 by 8, that is

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,100
64 components, like a chess board, and go ahead and see if you can make the

112
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,100
terrain of those specifications right now.

113
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,100
OK, welcome back!

114
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,100
So let's take a look! So, we're going for 1,000 meters in half meter

115
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,100
quads, with an 8 by 8. OK, so we can set the 8 by 8 straight away, so

116
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,100
we're constraining ourselves to that. We want 50 centimeter quads,

117
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,100
so there you go! You might ask, what do you do about the Z scale? It's not super important, it doesn't

118
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,100
change the way that the terrain sculpting tools work, so

119
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,100
you can leave the Z scale at the default, if you wish.

120
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,100
Right so, how big is this terrain? Well, we want a kilometer. It's actually the

121
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,100
right size right now, because we've got 2,000 things at half a meter. So that

122
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,100
is a kilometer by a kilometer. Remember that you can look at this rod.

123
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Now the rod is still here, but it is a little bit hidden,

124
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,100
so if I could just drop the terrain down. There you go! You can see it's about a

125
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,100
kilometer now. Alright, so you want to leave your terrain

126
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,100
with those settings that I've got on the screen there. You're going to end up needing a section size of 255

127
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,100
by 255 quads.

128
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,100
One section per component is fine, that's a

129
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,100
further optimization we don't need to worry about, for the moment, to do with how the level of detail handling works,

130
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,100
and let's just create that terrain! Great, so we have a

131
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,100
terrain! Now, I'm going to delete my funny rod measuring tool thing,

132
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Cube it's called. I don't need it. This

133
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,100
weird effect we're getting here is a lighting effect, and

134
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,100
you may right now, depending on your machine, be having performance issues,

135
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,100
so let me just show you something. If you go to Settings and

136
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,100
then you can come down here to Engine Scalability Settings,

137
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,100
and if you're having performance issues, you can choose Low or Medium or

138
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,100
High, Epic, or Auto. Auto may work for you, and that will determine

139
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,100
what this ends up looking like and how fast your editor operates, alright,

140
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,100
so bear that in mind. Now, these issues here will go away if we do

141
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,100
a lighting build, so we want the lighting quality to be just down at Preview for now.

142
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,100
And if we build the lighting, it's going to take away these funny issues

143
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,100
between the sections, once it's finished. But I suspect that building this lighting may

144
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,100
give us a warning that we've got too large of a scene to be

145
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,100
doing what they call indirect or bounce lighting, without something called a Light

146
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Mass Volume, which you may have come across if you've been exploring volumes here.

147
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,100
There's something called a Lightmass Importance Volume there. So, we may get a

148
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,100
warning, in a moment, that we need to use a Lightmass Importance Volume, because otherwise,

149
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,100
it's trying to do indirect or bounce lighting over such a large area that lighting building

150
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,100
is going to take forever. And it actually turns out that we don't really

151
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,100
need bounce lighting across our entire scene. We could arguably turn it off entirely

152
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,100
or put just a very small importance volume, which will

153
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,100
mean that only a tiny part of our scene actually has very detailed

154
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,100
bounce lighting. Let me show you their webpage, while my lighting builds.

155
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
You can read about it here just by clicking. I'll show you where I clicked. You go to

156
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,100
the Modes, Place, Volumes, Lightmass Importance, and click the question

157
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,100
mark, and that will come down here and show you that typically you have a massive terrain

158
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,100
they show around the outside the grid but only a tiny scene where the lighting needs to be calculated

159
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,100
fully and properly. So, we could do that! One way to speed

160
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,100
up our building time would be to just cancel the light building.

161
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,100
It actually is saying, "No importance volume found", the scene is massive, yada yada.

162
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,100
We could, for the moment, just in the middle of our scene... I'll just reset the position

163
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,100
of it, pop a Lightmass Importance Volume there, just a tiny one. Then,

164
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,100
you'll find that when you go to build the lighting that the whole

165
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,100
process of building the lighting will be a lot quicker, because it's saying well I'm going to ignore indirect

166
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,100
light bounces beyond 1, anywhere apart from in this tiny little volume.

167
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,100
And it may not look like it's quicker at first, but I think you'll find that it'll quickly

168
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,100
whip through. Remember before, I was chatting away for probably a minute and it only got to 50%

169
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
on my machine. This time I suspect it'll be a lot quicker than that, once it gets going.

170
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,100
So a couple of tips on speed optimization for you here,

171
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,100
if your machine is struggling with these larger terrains. Remember our goal here is to try and make a city

172
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,100
scale terrain, and so we are pushing a little bit. That's quite a

173
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,800
large area to be playing in, but it's perfectly appropriate for a tank game. So that's what we want to be doing.

174
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,800
So, we're coming to the end of the lighting build now. Actually, it still took

175
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,800
quite a while, but you'll see that all the components or sections have now

176
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
disappeared, and it's one homogenous terrain and I can now wonder around on it and

177
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,800
it looks fine. You shouldn't find that where you've put that Lightmass Volume is going to create any significant differences.

178
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,800
We'll worry about further terrain optimization later. What I'd like you to do is just

179
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,800
share with us whether this terrain is giving you reasonable performance.

180
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,800
One more objective way to do that is to go to the top of your viewport and click Show FPS

181
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,800
and play the game. So that you can see that here, my 1 by 1

182
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,800
kilometer, unmodified terrain is holding 120 frames a

183
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,800
second. I'll be interested to hear what your frame rates are, at this stage. Please post that in

184
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,800
the questions, and I will see you soon.

185
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:15,866
