00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to UI

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Scale Box. Buttons. & Mouse. where we'll be covering those three things. By the end of the video

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you will have a much improved menu system. where we

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
have a mouse. for a start. which you may notice we didn't have before. We'll be able to scale the

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
window with our title text and our buttons sticking appropriately and

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the background image scaling nicely. And that's it really. for now. the mouse

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
will have a default hover over effect. but it won't do anything yet. So. let's go and make that happen!

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.800


9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.800
So. the first thing you may notice is. I've slightly changed my window's screen scaling.

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.800
so that when I hit the play button here. inside the Main Menu blueprint.

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.800
I actually get a preview window that doesn't overspill my screen. So everything will

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.800
be a little bit smaller for you. for the next few videos. Alright. another thing

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.800
is that once we have actually brought up this preview screen...

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.800
By the way. it's previewing an empty scene

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.800
at the moment. So if you want it to preview the actual menu. you need to go to the MainMenu

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.800
level or scene. and then. back in the blueprint. when you click play you'll find it

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.800
previews your actual menu. Now. there's no mouse. so one of the first things we need

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.800
to sort out is. how do you show the mouse when the UI is displaying? Well.

19
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.800
let's take a look at that now. Back in the level blueprint.

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.800
for the MainMenu. we have currently just created the menu

21
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.800
widget instance. from the menu blueprint class. and added it to the

22
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.800
Viewport. What we need to do now is to show the player's

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800
mouse. So. we start by finding the player. So. if you do

24
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.800
a search. you can look for Get Player Controller. That is me. that's the human

25
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.800
player controlling this instance of the game.

26
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.800
So there's Get Player Controller! There you go! Now. from the return value. so that we

27
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.800
use the context sensitivity. we can then look for mouse.

28
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800
and then. one of the options towards the bottom will be Set Show Mouse Cursor.

29
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.800
So. we get a reference to the Player Controller. we tick Set Show

30
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.800
Mouse Cursor. and then bring that into the execution

31
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.800
flow. so that once we have added the widget to the Viewport.

32
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.800
we then show the mouse cursor. Let's try it! Either play from the

33
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.800
main menu. and you can see there is a mouse there. or you can go to the main menu

34
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.800
blueprint there and then. you could use the play button. and you'll see that

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.800
we now have a mouse. And that has a couple of benefits. firstly. we're going to be able to click the button when

36
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.800
it comes up. but secondly. I can go to the bottom-right of the window and I can resize it and that will

37
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.800
show us how this image responds to changes in screen size. Now. I don't

38
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.800
like that. at the moment. Firstly. it's not filling the background. and secondly. I don't like the

39
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.800
way that it's cropping and leaving black areas with different screen sizes.

40
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.800
So. let's sort that out. I'm going to rename Background Image to just MainBG. just to make

41
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.800
it shorter. but that's just really me being tidy. it's not super important.

42
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.800
It isn't actually variable. so it's not going to have an intractable element in it. so you can

43
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.800
un-tick Is Variable. if you wish. and also the MainBG will no longer be bold

44
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800
in the hierarchy. Now. what we need is under Panel.

45
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.800
you'll see there is a Scale Box. Now. if you hover over that and read it for yourself...

46
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.800
That's. by the way. Window. Palette. if you haven't got it. Panel section.

47
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800
and then. Scale Box. If you read the stuff that comes up. it'll tell you that it's ideal

48
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.800
for background images. So. let's use one of them. We pop it straight onto the [Canvas Panel]. which

49
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.800
is our main panel for our entire User Interface. and

50
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.800
instead of the background image being straight on the panel. we put it on the Scale Box.

51
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.800
Now. let's see the effect that has. Firstly. we want this Scale Box's anchors to

52
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.800
be this selection at the bottom-right. so that it covers the

53
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.800
entire background. and then we want no offsets either.

54
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.800
So. let's remove those offsets. and that sets it to cover most of the screen like

55
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.800
that. But most of the screen is not good

56
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.800
enough. we want all of the screen. so select 0.0 so that all of the offsets

57
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800
are 0.00 0.00 0.00. That way the Scale Box is covering

58
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.800
the entire UI canvas. and that is going to

59
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.800
be what we're looking for. So. let's see how this behaves now.

60
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800
So far similarly. and that's because the scaling type isn't

61
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800
what we're after. So. if you click on [Scale Box] and you look under the Stretching settings.

62
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.800
under details. and then. there is Scale to Fit but also

63
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.800
Scale to Fill. I took a while finding this recently. because they look almost identical. It's only a

64
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.800
couple of letters different right? So. try Scale to Fill. Let's have a look at

65
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.800
that now. as a preview.

66
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.800
Now that's nicer. look as we go up it takes a bit of the top and bottom of the image off. and left

67
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.800
and right. that works as well. Now. for a small array of different screen shapes.

68
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.800
like I'm going through now. this is working fine. And this also is important when you choose your image.

69
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.800
that you have what a designer would call quite zones around the left. right. top. and bottom

70
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.800
of the image. bits of the image that it doesn't matter too much if you lose. The screen could come in

71
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.800
a little bit like that. it can go out. and the image still looks OK.

72
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.800
Cool! So. now that we've got our scaling setup properly. let's go ahead

73
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.800
and show you how to add text and buttons. I'm not actually going to add them yet. I'm going to

74
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.800
challenge you to do that. But the things you're looking for to finish this initial version of the UI

75
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.800
off is number one Text. You can drag the Text into

76
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800
or straight onto the [Canvas Panel]. It is not inside the [Scale Box] you need to do this. the

77
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.800
[Scale Box] is purely for the background image. We could call it BG

78
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800
Scale. for instance. and then. you could even

79
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800
collapse that down. So. we have this background scale box there.

80
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.766
and then. now we have a Text Block. So this could be the title. you could rename that. but the point with Text Box

81
00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:20.800
is. you can move them around and under Appearance. under Font. you can change

82
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.800
the size of the text. Now. talking about font. please

83
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.800
take a little bit of time to customize the font. This default font is really boring and stinks of

84
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.800
somebody who's not bothered to customize it. So. somewhere like Dafont

85
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.800
is a good idea. Have a look through here. I'm going to use Ink Tank. So.

86
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.800
just searching for tank. you'll find Ink Tank here. but there's plenty of others! You could use

87
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.800
Boom Tank. you could use whatever.  Now. you want to have a look at

88
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.800
the license. it's up top here. Ink Tank is 100%

89
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.800
free. but Boom Tank. for example is free for personal use. If you're going to be

90
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.800
using this in an actual game. then you need to be thinking a little bit about what your

91
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.800
license is. and you need to be very careful that you either contact the author. if you're not sure.

92
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.800
or that you adhere to the license terms. And certainly. if you're going to be selling your game. you need to be

93
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.800
buying the font. But I'm going to use Ink Tank. which is free. Now. let's

94
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.800
get the font imported. Then. I'll show you how to make a button. then I'll leave you to

95
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.800
layout your UI. So. I'm going to download

96
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.800
the .zip file. In there I've got a .ttf. which is a True Type Font.

97
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.800
and the way you get that into Unreal is like the same way as you get any other asset in.

98
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.800
You go to your Content Browser. I'm going to go to

99
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.800
my UI folder. I'm going to import an asset. it's going to be Ink Tank. and

100
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.800
it's come in automatically as a font which is cool! So. back over here now.

101
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.800
in my list of fonts. I will simply be able to find Ink Tank.

102
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.800
There you go! So. that's how you put a text block in! The other thing I'm

103
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.800
going to show you is how you put a button in. You drop a button. not into the screen it won't work. but onto the

104
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.800
[Canvas Panel]. and then. again with a button you can resize it.

105
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.800
Think about the anchor. One of the first things you want to do with any UI element is think about where do you want your button

106
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.800
to be on the screen and where do you want it to stick to? Do you want it to stick to the bottom-right. the top-right. whatever?

107
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.800
And then. also you can drag text onto the button to label

108
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.800
it. alright. Now I want you to have a play with that. and remember to customize your fonts. So.

109
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.800
I'm going to delete that button for now and put you into your challenge which is to

110
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.800
layout your main menu. Choose a font for your title text. consider adding a

111
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.800
sub-title. add and style a start button. and check that the scaling

112
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.800
works well and that the button is visible at variety of different screen shapes.

113
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.800
So. go ahead. pause the video. and setup your UI now.

114
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.800
OK. welcome back! So.

115
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.800
I'm going to start by just putting some text in. as I did before. I'm going to call it Battle

116
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.800
Tank. Now hopefully you've found the property where you've set the text. it's here.

117
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.800
Let's go ahead and scale that up.

118
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.800
choose a font. Now. this text I want

119
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.800
anchored to the bottom-left of the screen. which means I want it to be a fixed offset from

120
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.800
the bottom-left of the screen. I'm going to justify it to the left. I think.

121
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.800
because I'm anchoring to the left it makes sense to justify to the left. so that we have. as I said.

122
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.800
the word starts in a fixed position compared to the bottom-left. Remember to go ahead and

123
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.800
preview these things nice and lean. i.e. nice and instantaneously. after you've put them

124
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.800
down. As soon as you've got your font how you want it. have a preview.

125
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.800
and just make sure that. for a reasonable range of screen shapes that. the

126
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.800
text doesn't interfere with the background and is legible. Great! That's looking OK

127
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.800
to me. Fine. now let's put in another button! But one

128
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.800
second first. I'm going to give this a name. Let's call it Title

129
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.800
Text. Fine! Now. let's pop a button in

130
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.800
onto the [Canvas Panel]. so we have the background scale box. By the way. that background

131
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.800
scale box aught to have a ZOrder. which is the Z depth.

132
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.800
It says higher numbers appear on top. so let's give it a value of -99 just to

133
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.800
indicate this is going to be way in the background. Anything less than 0 is fine.

134
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.800
and I'm just going to use -99. We just want to make sure that we explicitly tell the system that. that background

135
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.800
renders behind this text. which has a ZOrder of 0.

136
00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.800
Alright. otherwise there's a chance that it won't render in the right place.

137
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.800
then the text will be obscured. The same with the button. I'm going to leave the button at 0. The reason I'm choosing

138
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.800
-99 for the background images is because. then anything else you put in comes

139
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.800
with this default ZOrder of 0. and then. we don't need to worry about it. it's something we don't need to change every time.

140
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.800
So. let's have a button down on the bottom-left here. Now. immediately when

141
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.800
you put that UI element in. think about where its anchors should be. The buttons are going to be anchored to

142
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.800
the bottom-right. There's that! OK. now

143
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.800
it's going to be called StartButton.

144
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.800
Let's just call it Start Button. It is variable.

145
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.800
this Variable button. if you un-tick that you won't get any events and you won't be able to deal with on

146
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.800
click. so leave that variable. And it's bold in the hierarchy.

147
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.800
it just means it's an intractable element. Now. let's add on Text and drop it on the

148
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.800
StartButton. I'm just going to call it StartText.

149
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.800
And let's change the

150
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.800
text to the word Start.

151
00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.800
in capitals. I think it's nice and easy to read. Let's zoom in so we can see it.

152
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.800
Rescale a little bit. Start.

153
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.800
Just change the font to be consistent.

154
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.800
There you go. that's fine! Now if

155
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.800
you're finding that you don't like the alignment of this thing. it is possible to play around

156
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.800
with the padding. For instance. I could probably do with some more Top padding here.

157
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.800
Go to 4 or 5 pixels of Top padding or

158
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.800
6 even. I might just bring the word Start down a little bit and make it look a little bit more

159
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.800
sensible. something like that. And there you go. we now have a Start

160
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.800
button. Let's check the scaling. and then. we are done for this video!

161
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.800
So that's good! The Start button is

162
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.800
anchoring to the bottom-right. Battle Tank to the bottom-left. Unless we have a ridiculously narrow

163
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.800
screen. even at like 4:3. it's just about going to be feasible.

164
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.800
and on a wider screen. people have these wide monitors now. then it's all looking like

165
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.800
it's going to work which is great! Awesome! So. I'm going to

166
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.800
now commit my work. Remember to be using SourceControl yourself. I suggest every

167
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.800
single video. but you just want to get in the habit of committing your changes. Before you commit

168
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.800
anything. make sure you click Save All. of course. in Unreal so that all of your changes are saved to

169
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.800
disk. there are no asterisks up at the top here. And I will see you in the next video!

170
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.866


=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to UI

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Scale Box, Buttons, & Mouse, where we'll be covering those three things. By the end of the video

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
you will have a much improved menu system, where we

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
have a mouse, for a start, which you may notice we didn't have before. We'll be able to scale the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
window with our title text and our buttons sticking appropriately and

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the background image scaling nicely. And that's it really, for now, the mouse

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
will have a default hover over effect, but it won't do anything yet. So, let's go and make that happen!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,800


9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
So, the first thing you may notice is, I've slightly changed my window's screen scaling,

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
so that when I hit the play button here, inside the Main Menu blueprint,

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I actually get a preview window that doesn't overspill my screen. So everything will

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
be a little bit smaller for you, for the next few videos. Alright, another thing

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
is that once we have actually brought up this preview screen...

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
By the way, it's previewing an empty scene

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
at the moment. So if you want it to preview the actual menu, you need to go to the MainMenu

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,800
level or scene, and then, back in the blueprint, when you click play you'll find it

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,800
previews your actual menu. Now, there's no mouse, so one of the first things we need

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,800
to sort out is, how do you show the mouse when the UI is displaying? Well,

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
let's take a look at that now. Back in the level blueprint,

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,800
for the MainMenu, we have currently just created the menu

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
widget instance, from the menu blueprint class, and added it to the

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Viewport. What we need to do now is to show the player's

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,800
mouse. So, we start by finding the player. So, if you do

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,800
a search, you can look for Get Player Controller. That is me, that's the human

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
player controlling this instance of the game.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
So there's Get Player Controller! There you go! Now, from the return value, so that we

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,800
use the context sensitivity, we can then look for mouse,

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
and then, one of the options towards the bottom will be Set Show Mouse Cursor.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
So, we get a reference to the Player Controller, we tick Set Show

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Mouse Cursor, and then bring that into the execution

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,800
flow, so that once we have added the widget to the Viewport,

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
we then show the mouse cursor. Let's try it! Either play from the

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
main menu, and you can see there is a mouse there, or you can go to the main menu

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
blueprint there and then, you could use the play button, and you'll see that

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
we now have a mouse. And that has a couple of benefits, firstly, we're going to be able to click the button when

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,800
it comes up, but secondly, I can go to the bottom-right of the window and I can resize it and that will

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
show us how this image responds to changes in screen size. Now, I don't

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
like that, at the moment. Firstly, it's not filling the background, and secondly, I don't like the

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
way that it's cropping and leaving black areas with different screen sizes.

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
So, let's sort that out. I'm going to rename Background Image to just MainBG, just to make

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
it shorter, but that's just really me being tidy, it's not super important.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
It isn't actually variable, so it's not going to have an intractable element in it, so you can

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
un-tick Is Variable, if you wish, and also the MainBG will no longer be bold

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
in the hierarchy. Now, what we need is under Panel,

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
you'll see there is a Scale Box. Now, if you hover over that and read it for yourself...

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
That's, by the way, Window, Palette, if you haven't got it, Panel section,

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
and then, Scale Box. If you read the stuff that comes up, it'll tell you that it's ideal

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
for background images. So, let's use one of them. We pop it straight onto the [Canvas Panel], which

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
is our main panel for our entire User Interface, and

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
instead of the background image being straight on the panel, we put it on the Scale Box.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Now, let's see the effect that has. Firstly, we want this Scale Box's anchors to

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
be this selection at the bottom-right, so that it covers the

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
entire background, and then we want no offsets either.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
So, let's remove those offsets, and that sets it to cover most of the screen like

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
that. But most of the screen is not good

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
enough, we want all of the screen, so select 0.0 so that all of the offsets

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
are 0.00 0.00 0.00. That way the Scale Box is covering

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,800
the entire UI canvas, and that is going to

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,800
be what we're looking for. So, let's see how this behaves now.

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,800
So far similarly, and that's because the scaling type isn't

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,800
what we're after. So, if you click on [Scale Box] and you look under the Stretching settings,

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,800
under details, and then, there is Scale to Fit but also

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Scale to Fill. I took a while finding this recently, because they look almost identical. It's only a

64
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
couple of letters different right? So, try Scale to Fill. Let's have a look at

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,800
that now, as a preview.

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Now that's nicer, look as we go up it takes a bit of the top and bottom of the image off, and left

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
and right, that works as well. Now, for a small array of different screen shapes,

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
like I'm going through now, this is working fine. And this also is important when you choose your image,

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,800
that you have what a designer would call quite zones around the left, right, top, and bottom

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
of the image, bits of the image that it doesn't matter too much if you lose. The screen could come in

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
a little bit like that, it can go out, and the image still looks OK.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Cool! So, now that we've got our scaling setup properly, let's go ahead

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
and show you how to add text and buttons. I'm not actually going to add them yet, I'm going to

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
challenge you to do that. But the things you're looking for to finish this initial version of the UI

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
off is number one Text. You can drag the Text into

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
or straight onto the [Canvas Panel]. It is not inside the [Scale Box] you need to do this, the

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
[Scale Box] is purely for the background image. We could call it BG

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Scale, for instance, and then, you could even

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
collapse that down. So, we have this background scale box there,

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,766
and then, now we have a Text Block. So this could be the title, you could rename that, but the point with Text Box

81
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:20,800
is, you can move them around and under Appearance, under Font, you can change

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
the size of the text. Now, talking about font, please

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
take a little bit of time to customize the font. This default font is really boring and stinks of

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
somebody who's not bothered to customize it. So, somewhere like Dafont

85
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
is a good idea. Have a look through here. I'm going to use Ink Tank. So,

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
just searching for tank, you'll find Ink Tank here, but there's plenty of others! You could use

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Boom Tank, you could use whatever.  Now, you want to have a look at

88
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
the license, it's up top here. Ink Tank is 100%

89
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
free, but Boom Tank, for example is free for personal use. If you're going to be

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
using this in an actual game, then you need to be thinking a little bit about what your

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
license is, and you need to be very careful that you either contact the author, if you're not sure,

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,800
or that you adhere to the license terms. And certainly, if you're going to be selling your game, you need to be

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
buying the font. But I'm going to use Ink Tank, which is free. Now, let's

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
get the font imported. Then, I'll show you how to make a button, then I'll leave you to

95
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
layout your UI. So, I'm going to download

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
the .zip file. In there I've got a .ttf, which is a True Type Font,

97
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
and the way you get that into Unreal is like the same way as you get any other asset in.

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
You go to your Content Browser. I'm going to go to

99
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
my UI folder. I'm going to import an asset, it's going to be Ink Tank, and

100
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,800
it's come in automatically as a font which is cool! So, back over here now,

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
in my list of fonts, I will simply be able to find Ink Tank.

102
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,800
There you go! So, that's how you put a text block in! The other thing I'm

103
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
going to show you is how you put a button in. You drop a button, not into the screen it won't work, but onto the

104
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
[Canvas Panel], and then, again with a button you can resize it.

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Think about the anchor. One of the first things you want to do with any UI element is think about where do you want your button

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
to be on the screen and where do you want it to stick to? Do you want it to stick to the bottom-right, the top-right, whatever?

107
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
And then, also you can drag text onto the button to label

108
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
it, alright. Now I want you to have a play with that, and remember to customize your fonts. So,

109
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm going to delete that button for now and put you into your challenge which is to

110
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
layout your main menu. Choose a font for your title text, consider adding a

111
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
sub-title, add and style a start button, and check that the scaling

112
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
works well and that the button is visible at variety of different screen shapes.

113
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,800
So, go ahead, pause the video, and setup your UI now.

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
OK, welcome back! So,

115
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm going to start by just putting some text in, as I did before. I'm going to call it Battle

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Tank. Now hopefully you've found the property where you've set the text, it's here.

117
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Let's go ahead and scale that up,

118
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
choose a font. Now, this text I want

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
anchored to the bottom-left of the screen, which means I want it to be a fixed offset from

120
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
the bottom-left of the screen. I'm going to justify it to the left, I think,

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
because I'm anchoring to the left it makes sense to justify to the left, so that we have, as I said,

122
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
the word starts in a fixed position compared to the bottom-left. Remember to go ahead and

123
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,800
preview these things nice and lean, i.e. nice and instantaneously, after you've put them

124
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
down. As soon as you've got your font how you want it, have a preview,

125
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
and just make sure that, for a reasonable range of screen shapes that, the

126
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
text doesn't interfere with the background and is legible. Great! That's looking OK

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
to me. Fine, now let's put in another button! But one

128
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
second first, I'm going to give this a name. Let's call it Title

129
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Text. Fine! Now, let's pop a button in

130
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
onto the [Canvas Panel], so we have the background scale box. By the way, that background

131
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,800
scale box aught to have a ZOrder, which is the Z depth.

132
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
It says higher numbers appear on top, so let's give it a value of -99 just to

133
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,800
indicate this is going to be way in the background. Anything less than 0 is fine,

134
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,800
and I'm just going to use -99. We just want to make sure that we explicitly tell the system that, that background

135
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
renders behind this text, which has a ZOrder of 0.

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Alright, otherwise there's a chance that it won't render in the right place,

137
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
then the text will be obscured. The same with the button, I'm going to leave the button at 0. The reason I'm choosing

138
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
-99 for the background images is because, then anything else you put in comes

139
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,800
with this default ZOrder of 0, and then, we don't need to worry about it, it's something we don't need to change every time.

140
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,800
So, let's have a button down on the bottom-left here. Now, immediately when

141
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,800
you put that UI element in, think about where its anchors should be. The buttons are going to be anchored to

142
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
the bottom-right. There's that! OK, now

143
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
it's going to be called StartButton.

144
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Let's just call it Start Button. It is variable,

145
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
this Variable button, if you un-tick that you won't get any events and you won't be able to deal with on

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
click, so leave that variable. And it's bold in the hierarchy,

147
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
it just means it's an intractable element. Now, let's add on Text and drop it on the

148
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
StartButton. I'm just going to call it StartText.

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
And let's change the

150
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
text to the word Start,

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
in capitals. I think it's nice and easy to read. Let's zoom in so we can see it.

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Rescale a little bit, Start.

153
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Just change the font to be consistent.

154
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
There you go, that's fine! Now if

155
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,800
you're finding that you don't like the alignment of this thing, it is possible to play around

156
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
with the padding. For instance, I could probably do with some more Top padding here.

157
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Go to 4 or 5 pixels of Top padding or

158
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
6 even. I might just bring the word Start down a little bit and make it look a little bit more

159
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,800
sensible, something like that. And there you go, we now have a Start

160
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
button. Let's check the scaling, and then, we are done for this video!

161
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
So that's good! The Start button is

162
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
anchoring to the bottom-right, Battle Tank to the bottom-left. Unless we have a ridiculously narrow

163
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,800
screen, even at like 4:3, it's just about going to be feasible,

164
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
and on a wider screen, people have these wide monitors now, then it's all looking like

165
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
it's going to work which is great! Awesome! So, I'm going to

166
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
now commit my work. Remember to be using SourceControl yourself. I suggest every

167
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
single video, but you just want to get in the habit of committing your changes. Before you commit

168
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,800
anything, make sure you click Save All, of course, in Unreal so that all of your changes are saved to

169
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
disk, there are no asterisks up at the top here. And I will see you in the next video!

170
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,866
