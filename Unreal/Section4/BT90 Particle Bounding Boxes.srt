00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So welcome to Particle Bounding

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Boxes! What we're going to be doing, in this video, is getting rid of the horrible problem where our smoke

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
trails disappear, when you look at them at a sideways angle, and make sure that they

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,233
show all the way around like this. So let's go and see how that's done!

5
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:19,233
So this should be a relatively simple and short video. What we're going to be

6
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:23,233
doing is, looking at the fact that it if you fire a lot of these smoke

7
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:27,233
effects into the scene and then rotate your camera watch what happens. You see them disappearing. They're

8
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:31,233
still there in the world, but as I rotate the camera, at about 45

9
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:35,233
degrees off the camera, they disappear. That's not much fun, that looks kind of

10
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:39,233
silly, so what are we going to do about that. Well firstly, what's the root cause of it? Let's

11
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:43,233
go into the Tank Particle System, for a start.

12
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:47,233
I'm sorry, the Projectile Particle System, the Launch Blast Particle

13
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:51,233
System. Let's go into that! And if you scroll your Emitters

14
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:55,233
across and then click in the black space, just to make sure we're on the properties of

15
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:59,233
the Particle System itself, not any of the particular emitters.

16
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:03,233
If you scroll down here, I'll give a bit more space. Then one of the things you'll

17
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:07,233
see is that under the Bounds section, Use Fixed Relative Bounding, and in

18
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,233
fact, you can visualize these bounds, this zone in which the

19
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:15,233
particle systems are displayed, by clicking on this Bounds button

20
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:19,233
here. And you can even click the down arrow and say, Set Fixed

21
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:23,233
Bounds and that will show you, if you've got the bounds on, the zone in

22
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:27,233
which, provided that both the camera and the particle system are in that area,

23
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:31,233
then they will render. And if you see here, it actually

24
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:35,233
tells you the values. The problem is that, in our game, when we start moving the camera off

25
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:39,233
to the side, like this, we are getting outside of these bounding

26
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:43,233
boxes. Now it's not entirely intuitive how that's happening, it does look more

27
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:47,233
like it's a problem to do with billboarding, i.e. to do with these textures

28
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:51,233
facing the camera, but it isn't that, that's what I call a red herring. It is just

29
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:55,233
about the bounding box sizes. What it turns out we need, because we have a particle system

30
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:59,233
that spans a very large scale in our game, because

31
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:03,233
the same particle system is leaving smoke over a very long distance in the game.

32
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:07,233
In those circumstance and in those circumstances only, you don't want to Use

33
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:11,233
Fixed Bounding Boxes, you want to turn that setting off. And what

34
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:15,233
that will do is, it will recalculate the bounding boxes every frame. Now that will have a performance

35
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:19,233
hit, it may or may not be noticeable in your system. We'll test that in a minute, in fact, it's going to be

36
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:23,233
part of your challenge. But if you turn off this Use Fixed Relative Bounding Boxes,

37
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:27,233
it's going to, as I say, calculate the visibility requirements every

38
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:31,233
single frame. Now, It's going to warn you that you have a particle system

39
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:35,233
with no bounding box and it contains a GPU Emitter. What's a GPU Emitter?

40
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:39,233
The Sparks are the GPU Emitter, they're very subtle, they'er hardly

41
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:43,233
any part of the effect, and we can actually just remove that altogether. You

42
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:47,233
can see that it's a GPU Emitter, because it says GPU Sprites here. What that is,

43
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:51,233
by the way, is if you right-click in the Emitter it's the TypeData is of

44
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:55,233
type ?GPU Sprites, and this means that this particular effect is

45
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:59,233
rendered on the GPU and it's rendered on the GPU using an optimization based

46
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:03,233
on scene depth, because GPU's basically can only do things

47
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:07,233
in parallel. And one way to make these types of GPU

48
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:11,233
sprites very fast is to allow the GPU to do it, and different calls

49
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:15,233
on the GPU can do different parts of the scene but it can only do that if it's all based on scene

50
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:19,233
depth and that messes up when we start coming to this wide angle. You can see it's already

51
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:23,233
fixed, because I've toggled that setting, I can go all the way around now. So

52
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:27,233
what we're not allowed to do is have variable bounding boxes and a GPU emitter, but we don't

53
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:31,233
need the Sparks, so I'm going to go ahead and just delete the emitter altogether.

54
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:35,233
So right-click on your Sparks, delete it altogether. It'll hardly make any difference to the

55
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:39,233
visual appearance of your smoke trails, but it will stop

56
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:43,233
the warning and make sure we don't get serious performance glitches. So there it is,

57
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:47,233
that is the problem solved! So what I want you to do is, remember that you can go to Show

58
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:51,233
FPS here, from this down arrow at the top-left of your viewport,

59
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:55,233
and I want you to do the following. I want you to go ahead and test your performance impact. Measure your

60
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:59,233
Frames Per Second, with 20 smoke trails visible.

61
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:03,233
Turn on dynamic bounding boxes, like I just did. Measure again, see

62
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:07,233
if there's a change in the FPS, and share your results with the community. If you don't get any change and

63
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:11,233
you don't get anything interesting at 20 smoke trails, then maybe turn it up to 100 if you

64
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:15,233
can click that fast, 100 rounds in the tank. And just see if you can detect

65
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:19,233
how much difference it's making on your system, and then, share with us over on the community site, community.gamedev.tv,

66
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:23,233
what sort of impact this is having, this change in settings, on your

67
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:27,233
machine. I'll be very interested to see!

68
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,233
OK welcome back! So there is a small

69
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:35,233
resolution to this challenge. I'm just going to turn on my FPS. I am going to

70
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,233
do what I suggested you do, which is you go down... In fact, I'm going to collapse these other guys down.

71
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:43,233
So I can quickly get to this, I'm going to Use a Fixed Bounding Box, which should be of higher performance,

72
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:47,233
because it does not need to recalculate anything every frame. I'm going to fire off 20

73
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:51,233
of these guys, make sure they're all on the screen, and I'm just capped at 120

74
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:55,233
frames a second. So I'm on a, what am I on? An Intel i7

75
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:59,233
4 gigahertz quad core, with a GTX 980 (Graphics Card). So that's

76
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:03,233
the performance benchmark there. I'm going to suggest

77
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:07,233
that it's capped at 120 frames per second, therefore I'm not going to see any

78
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:11,233
change. So I'm going to need more projectiles, I'm going to go to 200 projectiles, and

79
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:15,233
I'm even going to turn down my minimum reload time.

80
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:19,233
I'm not even sure I can click a mouse that fast, but it'll allow me to launch these really fast. But let's put a

81
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:23,233
lot of these guys in the scene, see if I can get the frame rate to drop.

82
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:27,233
It's pretty stubbornly sitting there at 120. You don't want to go too fast, sideways

83
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:31,233
with the camera, because then they're not rendering, but it isn't effecting my frame rates.

84
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:35,233
On my system the answer here is that it doesn't [Laughs] really make any difference how many of these

85
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:39,233
things are on the screen, it's not dropping the frame rate.

86
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:43,233
So now let's try going into using dynamic bounding boxes with

87
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:47,233
that many particles. Let's see if we now get a drop in frame rate! I'll even up the screen

88
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:51,233
resolution, by going to full screen. No, you see, even with these

89
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:55,233
dynamic bounding boxes, provided I don't accidentally click on Explorer, I've got full

90
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:59,233
three dimensional view of these things, and yet I'm still...

91
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:03,233
I know as long as I keep my mouse in the game window, I'm still not getting a drop in frame rate.

92
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:07,233
So on my system, anyway, it makes absolutely no difference, which is a very

93
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:11,233
cursory proof to me that that's absolutely fine to be using in this game.

94
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:15,233
In this instance, we can use dynamic bounding boxes and still tolerate the performance hit that we're

95
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:19,233
getting. So I'll be interested to see how it works for you! That's all I've really got to say on this

96
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:23,233
video. That is a solution to a common problem. I have also in your slides...

97
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:27,233
By the way, I've given you a slide that shows you how to do this, it's on the next slide there.

98
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:31,233
It says, click here to make sure that you are in the general particle system properties. Go down

99
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:37,333
to Bounds and click that. OK fantastic! Well done and I'll see you in the next video!
