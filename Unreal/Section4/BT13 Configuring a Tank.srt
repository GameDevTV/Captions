00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Configuring a Tank! In this video we're going to specifically setup our

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
tank. we're going to make sure it sits on the ground properly. that we actually

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
spawn a player when we start the game. We'll

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
sort the camera out in a future lecture. that we can have player tanks and third

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
party tanks. and as I say the physics is working. We'll be simplifying the tank

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
blueprint a little bit. tweaking the tank track positions.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.866
and a few other little bits. setting the game mode etc. So. let's get on with that!

9
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.866
OK. so before we start making this tank move. let's

10
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:40.866
fix it up a little bit. There are some issues right? It's sitting into the floor.

11
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:44.866
my tracks actually aren't positioned correctly. there's things wrong with the

12
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:48.900
blueprint in terms of the way that it's laid out. and the root

13
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.866
components. etc.. so we will be arranging that. The

14
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.866
tank is not the Default Pawn. at the moment. When we play we do not possess

15
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:00.866
the tank. we don't spawn a tank. so yeah a few things we need to

16
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.866
sort out. Let's take them one at a time. Let's start with adding a

17
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.866
mass to the tank and getting some physics going. So. if you lift the tank off the ground and

18
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.866
play it. you notice it just hangs in the air. because it's not simulating

19
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:16.866
physics. Well. that's a really easy fix. Over at the tank.

20
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:20.866
on the Tank component. not the Default Scene Root. because we're going to be

21
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:24.866
replacing that in a moment. In fact. let's just replace that now. We don't need a default

22
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.866
scene in root component. That gives us things like a transform and physics. etc.

23
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.866
but so does the static mesh of the tank itself. so

24
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:36.866
simpler is better. The tank static mesh does more than the DefaultSceneRoot.

25
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:40.866
so we're going to get rid of it. The way you do that is. you grab hold of the tank

26
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.866
and just parent it. or what looks like parenting it to the DefaultScene Root. But

27
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:48.866
you'll see that it says "Drop here to make Tank the new root. The default root will be deleted." That's

28
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:52.866
perfect. that's exactly what we want! So. let's go ahead and do that now! Now the

29
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:56.866
tank is at the root. so it's a simpler hierarchy. So. that's a thumbs up

30
00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:00.866
for me. So next. we go to the tank which is now at the root

31
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:04.866
and turn on simulate physics. and let's assign a sensible mass. Well.

32
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:08.866
tanks are somewhere between 10 and 60. 70 tons. so I'm going to go for 40

33
00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.866
metric tons. 40.000 kilos. 40 0 0 0.

34
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.866
OK. so that's the mass! We have some Simulate Physics on. We'll worry about the

35
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:20.866
other physics properties later. so of course. you need to compile the blueprint

36
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:24.866
and play. Let's just see! So. with your tank off the ground. let's see what happens. Ha ha!

37
00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:28.866
It falls to the ground. hits the ground very nicely this time. and that's because

38
00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:32.866
if we look at the tracks as

39
00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:36.866
models. as static meshes. you can see that the collision mesh that

40
00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:40.866
Unreal has created for us. here this purple outline. is actually pretty good and

41
00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:44.866
pretty appropriate. So. that's why the tank is falling until it hits the

42
00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:48.866
collision mesh of the tracks. Great! Alright. so

43
00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:52.866
that's that bit done! Now. I need to fine tune the position of

44
00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:56.866
these tracks. My left track is a little bit too far out. it's just sticking out here. and

45
00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:00.866
my right track. if we were to rotate the tank or just line ourselves up here. you

46
00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:04.866
can see is miles off. So. I'm just going to put the tank near the floor.

47
00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.866
And not to confuse things. by the way. I'm actually going to move this tank and spin

48
00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:12.866
it around. because remember there's a player start point here

49
00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:16.866
and that's where we're going to spawn our tank. This tank that we've placed in the world is not going to be

50
00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:20.866
our tank. this is an AI tank or will become an AI tank. Remember that we

51
00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:24.866
spawn the player into the world. as per the previous section. So.

52
00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:28.866
wrong axis! I'm just going to spin this tank around like that.

53
00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:32.866
and then. if we play what we've got is effectively is an enemy tank and we are the

54
00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:36.866
current player. Alright. so there's the tank. it's just off the ground. it falls to the

55
00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:40.866
ground when we start. it's all looking good. The challenge we have right now is these track positions.

56
00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:44.866
So. being very careful with Unreal's

57
00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:48.866
buggy socket system. I'm going to go into the

58
00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:52.866
the tank body and...

59
00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.866
Actually. once you've renamed these sockets I think it's pretty stable now. Let's see

60
00:03:56.866 --> 00:04:00.866
how it is. So. I'm going to go to the Left Track. I'm going to pick myself a preview mesh again.

61
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:04.866
and then. I'm going to

62
00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:08.866
line up and just pull it in a little bit. That's good! In fact.

63
00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:12.866
you probably want to use let's say a Left view is

64
00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:16.866
it? Something like that in Lit? Yeah. something like that

65
00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:20.866
or maybe it's a Right view. There you go! Right view and

66
00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:24.866
then the Left Track. you can see there's like a notch here in the body.

67
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:28.866
We can probably want to align that notch up. something like that. Now of course. if it's snapping

68
00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:32.866
wrongly. then you take your position snap. which is this

69
00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:36.866
one here. and you turn the value right down.

70
00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:40.866
till you can get the track in just the right position. There great! Alright. let's do the same

71
00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:44.866
on the Right Track. I'm always nervous when touching the sockets. because they're buggy

72
00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:48.866
or at least they are at the time of recording.

73
00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:52.866
There you go! That looks fine to me! Let's try putting a new

74
00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:56.866
tank in the world. because this tank that's already in the world... Oh. it has actually updated!

75
00:04:56.866 --> 00:05:00.866
Sometimes it does. sometimes it doesn't. but this has! That's fantastic! So. the tank is looking

76
00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:04.866
much better. and of course. any new tanks we drop in the world will have these new properties

77
00:05:04.866 --> 00:05:08.866
as well. so that's cool! Great. so we've added

78
00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:12.866
mass to the tank. We fine tuned the track position. We sorted out the root

79
00:05:12.866 --> 00:05:16.866
component in the blueprint. so the tank is there simplifying things. We've enabled physics

80
00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:20.866
and assigned a mass as I said. We now need to

81
00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:24.866
set the tank to the Default Pawn. Now of course. you've done that

82
00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:28.866
before. so I want you to set the tank blueprint as a Default Pawn. Create a

83
00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:32.866
BattleTankGameMode blueprint. based on the BattleTankGameMode's

84
00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:36.866
C++ class. There are several ways of doing that. we've done it in the previous section.

85
00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:40.866
Assign the tank as the Default Pawn. and check that the correct tank spawns

86
00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:44.866
on play. So. if your player start. like mine. is in the ground

87
00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:48.866
you may have a little bit of trouble. You may need to move the player start. There's a hint for you. Alright.

88
00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:52.866
we want to make sure that a new tank spawns. not just the one we've dropped in the world. but once we're

89
00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:56.866
playing there should be two. the one we left in the world and the one that spawns on play. i.e.

90
00:05:56.866 --> 00:06:00.866
us. Go ahead. pause the video. see if you can make that stuff work now.

91
00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:04.866


92
00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:08.866
Welcome back! So. I'm going to create the BattleTankGameMode blueprint. a slightly different way. The

93
00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:12.866
previous way I think that we did it is. we went to the Game Mode here. the C++ Game Mode.

94
00:06:12.866 --> 00:06:16.866
right-click. and "Create Blueprint class based on" it. You can do that. or

95
00:06:16.866 --> 00:06:20.866
you can notice that you can just go to Blueprint. And you can look at

96
00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:24.866
the Project Settings for the GameMode. which we're not going to change for now. but

97
00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:28.866
the world override. for this particular world. we're going to use

98
00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:32.866
a new GameMode here. so you want that setting. World override

99
00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:36.866
let's you get to a place where you can create a new blueprint class based

100
00:06:36.866 --> 00:06:40.866
on the BattleTankGameMode. It's exactly the same as right-clicking on the BattleTank

101
00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:44.866
GameMode C++ on the left and creating a blueprint. I just wanted to show you this other menu.

102
00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:48.866
so there it is! Let's call it BattleTankGameMode_BP.

103
00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:52.866
And this tells the

104
00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:56.866
GameMode. of which we'll only have one. what the Default Pawn is.

105
00:06:56.866 --> 00:07:00.866
The tank blueprint. cool! So. that's down there under classes. tank blueprint.

106
00:07:00.866 --> 00:07:04.866
alright. And remember. we're in the full blueprint editor here. so that's

107
00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:08.866
why it's quite complex looking. Great. so

108
00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:12.866
if we now play what happens? Well. we end up half way in the

109
00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:16.866
floor. Let's de-possess. F8. That lets you eject from

110
00:07:16.866 --> 00:07:20.866
the possessed player. So. what's going on? Where are we? If we look at the

111
00:07:20.866 --> 00:07:24.866
World Outliner. we have a tank there but that's not us actually.

112
00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:28.866
We have a PlayerController and a PlayerState. Something is a bit

113
00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:32.866
funny. so when something is a bit funny it's a good habit to go to your Developer Tools

114
00:07:32.866 --> 00:07:36.866
and make sure that you have your Output Log. Look "SpawnActor failed because

115
00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:40.866
of collision at spawn location". which is that location

116
00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:44.866
there. So. what is that location there? Well. it's probably the location of

117
00:07:44.866 --> 00:07:48.866
Player Start. Let's have a look. Yes it is. 0. 0. 112.

118
00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:52.866
So. what's happening is that our Player Start... Let me just give myself

119
00:07:52.866 --> 00:07:56.866
some room here. we just go to it. ...is in the

120
00:07:56.866 --> 00:08:00.866
ground. and then. the tank can't spawn there because the player starts in the ground. So. if I

121
00:08:00.866 --> 00:08:04.866
move the Player Start off the ground a bit and try playing again. ah hah!

122
00:08:04.866 --> 00:08:08.866
The camera's all wrong. but look what happens! The tank spawns and now we have

123
00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:12.866
two tanks. if I eject with the F8 key then move around. This

124
00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:16.866
is our player tank. And are we possessed in that tank? Well. click Possess.

125
00:08:16.866 --> 00:08:20.866
you end up right in the middle of it. It looks like it to me! So. that's pretty

126
00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:24.866
cool. right! Now. you might ask why this camera's here. sitting in the middle of the tank

127
00:08:24.866 --> 00:08:28.866
like this. Well. we'll be dealing with the camera in the next

128
00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:32.866
video. So. that's it! We have managed to tweak our tank. We

129
00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:36.866
have AI tanks that look just like the player tanks. so we're on a level ground.

130
00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:40.866
literally at the moment. [Laughs] And also

131
00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:44.866
metaphorically. we want to be on an even keel. [Laughs] I like to throw out as many English

132
00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:48.866
metaphors as I can. We want us and the AI tank to...

133
00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:52.866
It wants to be fair right. so it's fair in terms of

134
00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:56.866
our tank is the same as the AI tank. and it's going to be fair later. because we're going to force the AI

135
00:08:56.866 --> 00:09:00.866
to drive like we do. using the same controls and the same physics. And

136
00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:04.866
that's going to be really cool. because that make the game much more equitable. So.

137
00:09:04.866 --> 00:09:08.866
let's move on and look at how we're going to deal with the camera

138
00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:12.866
and various other aspect. So. see you soon!

139
00:09:12.866 --> 00:09:13.199
