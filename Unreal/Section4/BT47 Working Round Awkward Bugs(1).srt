1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we're in this somewhat rambling video! You will be learning about Working Around

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Awkward Bugs. and by the end of it. your

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
tanks will no longer be jittering around. And I'm just going to talk you through the process

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that I went through. in order to find this bug in between videos. It took me about

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
2 or 3 hours to get to the bottom of it. I still didn't quite get to the bottom of it. but we'll see the process

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and we'll see a work around. and that'll be good enough for us to move on.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So we've upgraded to 4.12! We have a commit

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in our repository. We actually probably ought to tag

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
here. even though the commit says that we've upgraded to

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
4.12. I'm actually going to use the tagging system to add a tag to this. specifically

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
commit. saying 4.12 like that.I think that's just going to make

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
sense. as well. So. you can right-click the

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
commit. Tag. then it'll fill in the specific commit and then

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
4.12. And then. that'll just leave this tag here in the hierarchy. as we

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
proceed up. It'll remind me where I did my upgrade. a bit like this 4.11 upgrade there.

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You see. it's just pretty handy to just immediately see where you went to

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which version. Anyway. so we've upgraded to 4.12. and we have an issue.

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now this is not completely uncommon. the issue actually was there in 4.11.

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but it's considerably worse in 4.12. Look at this guy over  here. he's got serious

21
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
issues going on. bouncing around all over the place. Now. this purple outline.

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I've turned on by the way. is just here under Show and Collision. I think that's

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
probably the only thing I've changed. in between videos. So Show. Collision will turn

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
on your Collision Outliner. but it doesn't give you a huge amount of clues as to what on earth is going

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
on here. So the purpose of this video. really. is to just go through a process of

26
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
trying to work out how on earth these tanks have ended up in this

27
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
state and what it could be. So let's explore

28
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
a few things! I have now worked out what the bug is. Obviously I'm not going to show you all of the

29
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
thought process. because it was quite a lot of messing around. but I'll show

30
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
you the sorts of things that I did to get here. So firstly. let's

31
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
go look at the tank blueprint and remind ourselves how it's put together.

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Here we go. in the Viewport. Now. we've got all of these components to it and we've got these

33
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
tracks. and then. the tracks themselves are made up of these Static Meshes.

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which we can inspect. And the Static Meshes. if we turn the Collision Box here

35
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
on in the Static Mesh Inspector. you can see there's actually two sets of Collision

36
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
on here. We have the outer simplified Collision. and then. we have

37
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this guy which I can turn on and off under LOD0. Enable Collision.

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So I initially thought. well maybe it's something to do with this? Maybe we don't want this

39
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
complex. more complex. Collision Mesh? So I turned that off. and you can also turn it off in the

40
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Import Settings. so it doesn't create this more complex Collision

41
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Mesh. because we actually only want this simplified one on the outside. So I did that.

42
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but unfortunately it doesn't change anything. but it has

43
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
reduced the amount of collision data. in the game. a little bit. So once

44
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
you're in the spirit of simplifying Collision Meshes. you may as well do the same thing for the

45
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
turret. You'll notice that has also imported with a more complex Collision Mesh

46
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
there. So I think it's worth just stopping that from happening on import and then under LOD0

47
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
just turning that off as well and saving it. And again. at all these stages. when you're

48
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
trying these things. it's worth just trying and see if it fixes things. It hasn't.

49
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
as it happens. fixed it! So you could try the same for the barrel. but this would be getting tenuous.

50
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Now I'm going to do it for the barrel. Interestingly the problem is

51
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
related to the barrel strangely. even though you wouldn't expect it to be. It's very

52
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
tempting here to go. well it must be something to do with the tracks colliding with the ground.

53
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So you could. for example. in your tank blueprint go to your

54
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
tracks and you could remove them even. and see if that

55
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
makes a difference. I don't see there's any harm in doing that. so let's remove the tracks and try playing.

56
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And then. unfortunately you see it's still work. doing

57
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the same thing. So I can use a Control Z hopefully. on the blueprint. to put them back.

58
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So very odd right! Now. what other clues have we got? Always look

59
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
in your log. Is there anything in here? Well I'm not seeing anything right now. We could try playing

60
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
again and just leaving it running for a second. because it's a really weird sporadic error

61
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and it's still still not solved.

62
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
OK. so it's starting to be a little strange. Now.

63
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
what else could this. what else could this possibly be?

64
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
You can look at things like the positioning of these

65
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
sockets. to see that perhaps the colliders of the track are

66
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
interacting with the colliders of the tank or something. I've tried that. tried moving all the sockets around.

67
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
no good it doesn't make any difference. There is something else I really want you to note here.

68
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which is that we hid. on the Left and Right Tracks. the Collision...

69
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Or no we didn't on the Left and Right Tracks. but on the Turret

70
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
we hid the Collision section. Do you remember in the C++ code? Let's go and have a look at it!

71
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Because one thing about just coming in here and

72
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
fiddling with all the physics settings on the tank is. they may not all be there.

73
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
because we chose on the TankTurret.h to

74
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
say hidecategories = ("Collision"). so I'm actually going to reverse that decision for a moment. So

75
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
on your TankTurret.h. remove the bit that says hidecategories = ("Collision").

76
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
or you can simply. if you want to keep the code. you can comment it and then just close

77
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
your braces appropriately. And I think we did the same thing on the turret.

78
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the barrel rather. So close the brackets and just comment out the hidecategories = ("Collision")

79
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
on the turret and the barrel. So what that's going to do for us

80
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is. it's going to give us some more levers back again. when we're inspecting the turret

81
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
here in the tank blueprint. At the moment we don't have Collision. and because we disabled Collision it also

82
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
took the Physics sub-section with it. And it may be that you can't solve the bug without

83
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
a setting that's in one of those things. So it's a very useful tip to think.

84
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
well am I seeing everything? So now if we come back to the Turret. you'll see actually we've

85
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
got Collision back on. Alright. so

86
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
what is going on? On the Tank. what

87
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
could this be to do with it? It's almost certainly to do with Collision. but what is it about

88
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Collision? I don't think there's anything on the tank itself. i.e. the top level

89
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Actor. The Tank. the Static Mesh

90
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Root. is there anything on there that could be possibly causing the problem? Well we need

91
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
to be simulating physics. we need to have gravity. You should ask the question. do

92
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
we want gravity enabled on the tracks? Well probably not so I'm going to go and turn

93
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
gravity off on the tracks and try and see if that fixes things. because we only

94
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
want to simulate gravity on the root object but that still hasn't helped. strangely.

95
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So you can carry on down the tank and say. well what's this Auto

96
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Weld setting? It's disabled at the top-level body. but it's there on the Left

97
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and the Right Tracks. Now it turns out that this does have something to do with the bug. If we

98
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
turn off Auto Weld. which makes as it says all of the

99
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
rigid bodies joined into a single RigidBody of the parent. Look

100
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
what happens! Whoa. flying tank! So that's bad

101
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
obviously. but it's also good because we're getting a little closer. It's something

102
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to do with the way that the tank's colliders are interacting with

103
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
themselves. So we want Welding on for the tracks and we want Welding on for

104
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the Turret. if there's an option there. and there actually probably isn't and

105
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
why... Ah there is! Sorry there is and

106
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
also the Barrels. So they all have Auto Welding on. there is no Welding for the Azimuth

107
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Gimbal. You may. by the way. hypothesize that it's something to do with this Camera Gimbal. so you

108
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
could delete it and test. recompile the blueprint. and play.

109
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Now I have an unresolved compiler error. and that's because

110
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
things are relying on that Camera Gimbal. so I better put that back. [Laughs]

111
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
That and that's crashed the Editor! So

112
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
this is why it's really important to have yourself a stage here in your SourceControl. before

113
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
you go messing around trying to work out what the solution is. So let's go back to that Tank blueprint

114
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and see if we can continue to dive

115
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
nose and workout what's going on. I can't really give you a challenge for this video. apart from

116
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
stop the video now and work it out for yourself. but you know that's a tricky one.

117
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So I'm going to check that we haven't lost anything. The Left the Right Track. the Turret. and the Barrel

118
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
should all have Auto Weld on them. and none of them should have Enable Gravity. You see that

119
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
checkbox means that some are set and some aren't. So Auto Weld should be on.

120
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Enable Gravity should be off. That's definitely what we want but unfortunately. the

121
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
tracks are still popping through the ground. Hmm.

122
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
How strange! Now. at one point. in fact. it's there in the logs. Look at this!

123
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I saw this pop up! Ah. if I can see if

124
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I can get the logs working. I'm being wholly incompetent right now or something's going on.

125
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Oh come on! I'll just scroll up.

126
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
There's an error here somewhere. "Handled error" local pose is PLocalPose.isValid().

127
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So it's talking about a pose not being valid. in some physics

128
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
engine body setup. Hmm. what pose? Well this isn't a

129
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
humanoid character. right. it's a tank. but I think what's going on... I don't know. by the way. the exact

130
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
cause of this bug. but what I think's going on is. Unreal is somewhat processing this tank as if

131
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
it's a humanoid character. and that's causing it problems. See what I've

132
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
noticed is this. if we say take the Barrel away. for a moment. completely

133
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and compile. you'll notice the problem

134
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
goes away. We're taking the barrel away and the problem goes away. How strange right?

135
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So let's put the barrel back. Control Z. if it'll let me.

136
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Will it? Nope. so I'm gong to have to manually add the barrel

137
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
back. Tank Barrel. there it is. pop it in. and there's no harm in

138
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
refreshing these things anyway. to see if there's perhaps something wrong with the instance

139
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
of the Tank Barrel. So let's pop it back onto the socket

140
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
like that. reset its transform. We should be good to go. compile and play. So now

141
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I've actually rebuilt the barrel to see if that solves the problem. and actually. for the moment.

142
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
it has! Look the barrel is fixed. the problem is fixed.

143
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
after having rebuilt the barrel. Hmm. so

144
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
there was something wrong with the barrel but let's look deeper. If you go to your Event Graph

145
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
now. remember where we set the Barrel Reference? It's no longer there look. when we play the

146
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
game. the barrel won't move. because when we deleted that barrel we lost

147
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
this reference. OK no problem! So let's just pop. in fact. let's just rename this thing

148
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Barrel. I think that's how we had it before. And let's just put the reference

149
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
back. ready. so that the Set Barrel Reference code knows about the Barrel. Play the

150
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
game. Oh darn. the problem's back!

151
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
[Laughs] How strange is that?! So

152
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
one solution to this... Well it's not possible right. it's not possible to

153
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
make the solution. well let's not Set the Barrel Reference. we've got to Set the Barrel Reference. So what

154
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
can we do? Well it turns

155
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
out that if you were to turn the Collider off on the Turret. the Collision off

156
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
on the Turret that would also solve it. Now. one way you could do that is. you could

157
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
come into the. sorry. the Turret here. and you

158
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
could set the Collision Presets. to the Turret. to NoCollision.

159
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
compile. and play. Let's see what that does! That makes it go really funny.

160
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Let's try doing the same on the Barrel now. So it's kind of shooting

161
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
in the dark. We'll just trying and find a solution that works. for the moment. No Collision on the Barrel. does that

162
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
work? Actually that does! So if there's no collision on the Barrel

163
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
or the Turret. then we are good to go. we don't have the

164
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
problem anymore. So look. I really don't know precisely what's going on here. In this

165
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
instance you would ask yourself. do I want to try living with it for a bit.

166
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
because I would report this bug to Unreal...

167
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
It's not really a bug yet. we don't know that it's a bug. but we know that we're not sure why this is happening

168
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
right. Why is it something to do with this hierarchy and this self interaction of

169
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
colliders? Why is it causing this problem? So you'd report it to Unreal. you'd say well actually I can

170
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
still play the game. even if my projectiles can't hit the turret and the barrel. for the moment.

171
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You would note that it got worse from

172
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
4.11 to 4.12. Now. we don't know whether that means it's going to get better

173
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
or worse in a future version of 4.12. It may be the way we're using the engine

174
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
is. well. it's staying the same. but that that Unreal's

175
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
idea of how to do these things is diverging from us or it might be that this will get better. So

176
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
what I'm going to suggest is that we loop back to this later. if it causes a game play

177
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
problem and. in the meanwhile. that we ask Unreal what is going on. Can

178
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
you tell us why this is having this problem? Alright. so there's two

179
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
ways of solving it. One is to go to the Turret and the Barrel and turn on NoCollision.

180
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
If you don't want to do that you can leave it back at BlockAllDynamic. where the problem will

181
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
occur. and you can go to the Turret

182
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Mesh and then you can Remove the

183
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Collision Volume like that. And if you do that on the Turret Mesh. it will

184
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
also solve the problem. OK. so why is the tank jumping?

185
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Oh. it's still doing it actually. so that's not a reliable way of doing

186
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
it. You're going to want to remove the Collision Mesh. also on the

187
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Barrel or Turn off Collisions. I think those two things are equivalent.

188
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
so let's just try it the other way. Remove Collision Mesh on the Barrel.

189
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
play the game and just see if it's reliable now. I'm looking for it to not jump at all.

190
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So while I wait to see if any of those tanks jump. when they

191
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
ominously aim at me. I was saying that why does the tank jump when we have this problem? Well

192
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
frankly. I don't know but what's going on is something like. we are messing up

193
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
the collision detection on the tank itself. because

194
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
of the way that these objects that are

195
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
in a hierarchy are interacting with one another. Possibly because Unreal is

196
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
making some assumptions about the rigging. i.e. the order in which these things

197
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
are parented. which would normally be like spine and then. you know. shoulder and arms

198
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and stuff like that. being humanoid and it's not a humanoid. So

199
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that's my best guess! We'll ask Unreal in the meanwhile and then we can crack on.

200
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
because we actually had this problem in our prototype. and some of you may have

201
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
spotted it in the video. the tank jumping off bits of the terrain when it shouldn't have done. I think this

202
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
was the same thing. it wasn't actually hitting something on the terrain but it was just having a weird

203
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
self collision glitch. and it's like putting an impulse through the tank and knocking it in the air.

204
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But removing the Collision Meshes or turning off Collision. which is the same thing

205
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
really for the barrel and the turret. solves the problem. Now we can focus on the tank

206
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
base and on getting that doing what we want. So in the next video. we'll pick up

207
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
projectiles where we left off. and yeah. sorry about the

208
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
diversion to 4.12 but it was required. You've got more disk space. the latest version of Unreal.

209
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and this fundamental bug is worked around but not resolved.

210
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.500


=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we're in this somewhat rambling video! You will be learning about Working Around

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Awkward Bugs, and by the end of it, your

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
tanks will no longer be jittering around. And I'm just going to talk you through the process

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that I went through, in order to find this bug in between videos. It took me about

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
2 or 3 hours to get to the bottom of it. I still didn't quite get to the bottom of it, but we'll see the process

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and we'll see a work around, and that'll be good enough for us to move on.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we've upgraded to 4.12! We have a commit

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
in our repository. We actually probably ought to tag

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
here, even though the commit says that we've upgraded to

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
4.12. I'm actually going to use the tagging system to add a tag to this, specifically

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
commit, saying 4.12 like that,I think that's just going to make

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
sense, as well. So, you can right-click the

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
commit, Tag, then it'll fill in the specific commit and then

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
4.12. And then, that'll just leave this tag here in the hierarchy, as we

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
proceed up. It'll remind me where I did my upgrade, a bit like this 4.11 upgrade there.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You see, it's just pretty handy to just immediately see where you went to

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which version. Anyway, so we've upgraded to 4.12, and we have an issue.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now this is not completely uncommon, the issue actually was there in 4.11,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but it's considerably worse in 4.12. Look at this guy over  here, he's got serious

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
issues going on, bouncing around all over the place. Now, this purple outline,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've turned on by the way, is just here under Show and Collision. I think that's

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
probably the only thing I've changed, in between videos. So Show, Collision will turn

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
on your Collision Outliner, but it doesn't give you a huge amount of clues as to what on earth is going

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
on here. So the purpose of this video, really, is to just go through a process of

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
trying to work out how on earth these tanks have ended up in this

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
state and what it could be. So let's explore

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
a few things! I have now worked out what the bug is. Obviously I'm not going to show you all of the

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
thought process, because it was quite a lot of messing around, but I'll show

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
you the sorts of things that I did to get here. So firstly, let's

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
go look at the tank blueprint and remind ourselves how it's put together.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here we go, in the Viewport. Now, we've got all of these components to it and we've got these

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
tracks, and then, the tracks themselves are made up of these Static Meshes,

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
which we can inspect. And the Static Meshes, if we turn the Collision Box here

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
on in the Static Mesh Inspector, you can see there's actually two sets of Collision

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
on here. We have the outer simplified Collision, and then, we have

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
this guy which I can turn on and off under LOD0, Enable Collision.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So I initially thought, well maybe it's something to do with this? Maybe we don't want this

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
complex, more complex, Collision Mesh? So I turned that off, and you can also turn it off in the

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Import Settings, so it doesn't create this more complex Collision

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mesh, because we actually only want this simplified one on the outside. So I did that,

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but unfortunately it doesn't change anything, but it has

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
reduced the amount of collision data, in the game, a little bit. So once

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
you're in the spirit of simplifying Collision Meshes, you may as well do the same thing for the

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
turret. You'll notice that has also imported with a more complex Collision Mesh

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
there. So I think it's worth just stopping that from happening on import and then under LOD0

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
just turning that off as well and saving it. And again, at all these stages, when you're

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
trying these things, it's worth just trying and see if it fixes things. It hasn't,

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
as it happens, fixed it! So you could try the same for the barrel, but this would be getting tenuous.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now I'm going to do it for the barrel. Interestingly the problem is

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
related to the barrel strangely, even though you wouldn't expect it to be. It's very

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
tempting here to go, well it must be something to do with the tracks colliding with the ground.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So you could, for example, in your tank blueprint go to your

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
tracks and you could remove them even, and see if that

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
makes a difference. I don't see there's any harm in doing that, so let's remove the tracks and try playing.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And then, unfortunately you see it's still work, doing

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the same thing. So I can use a Control Z hopefully, on the blueprint, to put them back.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So very odd right! Now, what other clues have we got? Always look

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in your log. Is there anything in here? Well I'm not seeing anything right now. We could try playing

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
again and just leaving it running for a second, because it's a really weird sporadic error

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and it's still still not solved.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
OK, so it's starting to be a little strange. Now,

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
what else could this, what else could this possibly be?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You can look at things like the positioning of these

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
sockets, to see that perhaps the colliders of the track are

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
interacting with the colliders of the tank or something. I've tried that, tried moving all the sockets around,

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
no good it doesn't make any difference. There is something else I really want you to note here,

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
which is that we hid, on the Left and Right Tracks, the Collision...

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Or no we didn't on the Left and Right Tracks, but on the Turret

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we hid the Collision section. Do you remember in the C++ code? Let's go and have a look at it!

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because one thing about just coming in here and

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
fiddling with all the physics settings on the tank is, they may not all be there,

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
because we chose on the TankTurret.h to

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
say hidecategories = ("Collision"), so I'm actually going to reverse that decision for a moment. So

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
on your TankTurret.h, remove the bit that says hidecategories = ("Collision"),

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
or you can simply, if you want to keep the code, you can comment it and then just close

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
your braces appropriately. And I think we did the same thing on the turret,

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the barrel rather. So close the brackets and just comment out the hidecategories = ("Collision")

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
on the turret and the barrel. So what that's going to do for us

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
is, it's going to give us some more levers back again, when we're inspecting the turret

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
here in the tank blueprint. At the moment we don't have Collision, and because we disabled Collision it also

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
took the Physics sub-section with it. And it may be that you can't solve the bug without

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
a setting that's in one of those things. So it's a very useful tip to think,

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
well am I seeing everything? So now if we come back to the Turret, you'll see actually we've

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
got Collision back on. Alright, so

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
what is going on? On the Tank, what

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
could this be to do with it? It's almost certainly to do with Collision, but what is it about

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Collision? I don't think there's anything on the tank itself, i.e. the top level

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Actor. The Tank, the Static Mesh

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Root, is there anything on there that could be possibly causing the problem? Well we need

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to be simulating physics, we need to have gravity. You should ask the question, do

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
we want gravity enabled on the tracks? Well probably not so I'm going to go and turn

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
gravity off on the tracks and try and see if that fixes things, because we only

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
want to simulate gravity on the root object but that still hasn't helped, strangely.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So you can carry on down the tank and say, well what's this Auto

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Weld setting? It's disabled at the top-level body, but it's there on the Left

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and the Right Tracks. Now it turns out that this does have something to do with the bug. If we

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
turn off Auto Weld, which makes as it says all of the

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
rigid bodies joined into a single RigidBody of the parent. Look

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
what happens! Whoa, flying tank! So that's bad

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
obviously, but it's also good because we're getting a little closer. It's something

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to do with the way that the tank's colliders are interacting with

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
themselves. So we want Welding on for the tracks and we want Welding on for

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the Turret, if there's an option there, and there actually probably isn't and

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
why... Ah there is! Sorry there is and

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
also the Barrels. So they all have Auto Welding on, there is no Welding for the Azimuth

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Gimbal. You may, by the way, hypothesize that it's something to do with this Camera Gimbal, so you

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
could delete it and test, recompile the blueprint, and play.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now I have an unresolved compiler error, and that's because

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
things are relying on that Camera Gimbal, so I better put that back. [Laughs]

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That and that's crashed the Editor! So

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
this is why it's really important to have yourself a stage here in your SourceControl, before

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
you go messing around trying to work out what the solution is. So let's go back to that Tank blueprint

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and see if we can continue to dive

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
nose and workout what's going on. I can't really give you a challenge for this video, apart from

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
stop the video now and work it out for yourself, but you know that's a tricky one.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So I'm going to check that we haven't lost anything. The Left the Right Track, the Turret, and the Barrel

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
should all have Auto Weld on them, and none of them should have Enable Gravity. You see that

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
checkbox means that some are set and some aren't. So Auto Weld should be on,

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Enable Gravity should be off. That's definitely what we want but unfortunately, the

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
tracks are still popping through the ground. Hmm,

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How strange! Now, at one point, in fact, it's there in the logs. Look at this!

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I saw this pop up! Ah, if I can see if

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can get the logs working. I'm being wholly incompetent right now or something's going on.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh come on! I'll just scroll up.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There's an error here somewhere. "Handled error" local pose is PLocalPose.isValid().

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So it's talking about a pose not being valid, in some physics

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
engine body setup. Hmm, what pose? Well this isn't a

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
humanoid character, right, it's a tank, but I think what's going on... I don't know, by the way, the exact

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
cause of this bug, but what I think's going on is, Unreal is somewhat processing this tank as if

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
it's a humanoid character, and that's causing it problems. See what I've

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
noticed is this, if we say take the Barrel away, for a moment, completely

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and compile, you'll notice the problem

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
goes away. We're taking the barrel away and the problem goes away. How strange right?

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So let's put the barrel back. Control Z, if it'll let me.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Will it? Nope, so I'm gong to have to manually add the barrel

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
back. Tank Barrel, there it is, pop it in, and there's no harm in

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
refreshing these things anyway, to see if there's perhaps something wrong with the instance

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
of the Tank Barrel. So let's pop it back onto the socket

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
like that, reset its transform. We should be good to go, compile and play. So now

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I've actually rebuilt the barrel to see if that solves the problem, and actually, for the moment,

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
it has! Look the barrel is fixed, the problem is fixed,

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
after having rebuilt the barrel. Hmm, so

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
there was something wrong with the barrel but let's look deeper. If you go to your Event Graph

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
now, remember where we set the Barrel Reference? It's no longer there look, when we play the

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
game, the barrel won't move, because when we deleted that barrel we lost

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
this reference. OK no problem! So let's just pop, in fact, let's just rename this thing

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Barrel, I think that's how we had it before. And let's just put the reference

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
back, ready, so that the Set Barrel Reference code knows about the Barrel. Play the

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
game. Oh darn, the problem's back!

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
[Laughs] How strange is that?! So

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
one solution to this... Well it's not possible right, it's not possible to

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
make the solution, well let's not Set the Barrel Reference, we've got to Set the Barrel Reference. So what

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
can we do? Well it turns

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
out that if you were to turn the Collider off on the Turret, the Collision off

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
on the Turret that would also solve it. Now, one way you could do that is, you could

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
come into the, sorry, the Turret here, and you

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
could set the Collision Presets, to the Turret, to NoCollision,

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
compile, and play. Let's see what that does! That makes it go really funny.

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's try doing the same on the Barrel now. So it's kind of shooting

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
in the dark. We'll just trying and find a solution that works, for the moment. No Collision on the Barrel, does that

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
work? Actually that does! So if there's no collision on the Barrel

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
or the Turret, then we are good to go, we don't have the

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
problem anymore. So look, I really don't know precisely what's going on here. In this

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
instance you would ask yourself, do I want to try living with it for a bit,

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
because I would report this bug to Unreal...

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's not really a bug yet, we don't know that it's a bug, but we know that we're not sure why this is happening

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
right. Why is it something to do with this hierarchy and this self interaction of

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
colliders? Why is it causing this problem? So you'd report it to Unreal, you'd say well actually I can

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
still play the game, even if my projectiles can't hit the turret and the barrel, for the moment.

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You would note that it got worse from

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
4.11 to 4.12. Now, we don't know whether that means it's going to get better

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
or worse in a future version of 4.12. It may be the way we're using the engine

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
is, well, it's staying the same, but that that Unreal's

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
idea of how to do these things is diverging from us or it might be that this will get better. So

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
what I'm going to suggest is that we loop back to this later, if it causes a game play

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
problem and, in the meanwhile, that we ask Unreal what is going on. Can

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you tell us why this is having this problem? Alright, so there's two

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
ways of solving it. One is to go to the Turret and the Barrel and turn on NoCollision.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If you don't want to do that you can leave it back at BlockAllDynamic, where the problem will

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
occur, and you can go to the Turret

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Mesh and then you can Remove the

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Collision Volume like that. And if you do that on the Turret Mesh, it will

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
also solve the problem. OK, so why is the tank jumping?

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, it's still doing it actually, so that's not a reliable way of doing

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
it. You're going to want to remove the Collision Mesh, also on the

187
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Barrel or Turn off Collisions. I think those two things are equivalent,

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
so let's just try it the other way. Remove Collision Mesh on the Barrel,

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
play the game and just see if it's reliable now. I'm looking for it to not jump at all.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So while I wait to see if any of those tanks jump, when they

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
ominously aim at me, I was saying that why does the tank jump when we have this problem? Well

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
frankly, I don't know but what's going on is something like, we are messing up

193
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the collision detection on the tank itself, because

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
of the way that these objects that are

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
in a hierarchy are interacting with one another. Possibly because Unreal is

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
making some assumptions about the rigging, i.e. the order in which these things

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
are parented, which would normally be like spine and then, you know, shoulder and arms

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and stuff like that, being humanoid and it's not a humanoid. So

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
that's my best guess! We'll ask Unreal in the meanwhile and then we can crack on,

200
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
because we actually had this problem in our prototype, and some of you may have

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
spotted it in the video, the tank jumping off bits of the terrain when it shouldn't have done. I think this

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
was the same thing, it wasn't actually hitting something on the terrain but it was just having a weird

203
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
self collision glitch, and it's like putting an impulse through the tank and knocking it in the air.

204
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But removing the Collision Meshes or turning off Collision, which is the same thing

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
really for the barrel and the turret, solves the problem. Now we can focus on the tank

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
base and on getting that doing what we want. So in the next video, we'll pick up

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
projectiles where we left off, and yeah, sorry about the

208
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
diversion to 4.12 but it was required. You've got more disk space, the latest version of Unreal,

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and this fundamental bug is worked around but not resolved.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,500
