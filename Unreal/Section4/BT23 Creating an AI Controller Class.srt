
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, in this video we're going

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to be Creating an AI Controller Class! By the end of it, you'll have a

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
couple of different AI tanks placed in the scene, and when we play the game, your player will

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
spawn in, at the player start point. And in the logs, if you look down in the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Output Log at the bottom of the screen, you'll see that we'll be reporting that the AI

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Controller, which we'll be creating, is possessing a couple of the tanks and that we

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,633
are possessing a third. So good news, we'll see you in there!

8
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:31,633
So, before we go any deeper into the aiming architecture, let's take a look

9
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:35,633
at the basics of the Tank AI Controller. So, that's

10
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:39,633
kind of analogous to the Tank Player Controller. The players us will possess the, well

11
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,633
the tank that is spawned at the player start point, the rest of the tanks the AI Control

12
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:47,633
tanks we'll be placing into the game, well this game anyway, at design time.

13
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:51,633
We'll just drop the tanks in. Of course, they could be spawned in as well, at play time.

14
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,633
So, let's take a look at how that's going to work! The first thing we're going to need

15
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:59,633
is a Tank AI Controller class. Now, this is a little bit different. We're going to do this,

16
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:03,633
obviously C++ Classes, Add New, New C++ Class.

17
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:07,633
So, go ahead and do that, but you won't find it here,  You won't find the AI

18
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:11,633
Controller in this standard list, so you need to click Show All Classes in order to find

19
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:15,633
it. And we're looking for AI Controller, which is a child

20
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:19,633
of Controller, just like the PlayerController was. So, we have Actor, Controller,

21
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:23,633
and then, under that there's PlayerController and AIController. So, we're going to go for a new

22
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:27,633
C++ class, based on the AI Controller, and we're going to extend it's

23
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:31,633
functionality. Cool! What are we going to call it? Well, let's be conventional.

24
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,633
Let's go TankAIController,

25
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,633
leaving the Public checkbox ticked. For now, we're going to do that for the entire section, just

26
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,633
while you get used to just the fact that it separates your files into public and private

27
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:47,633
and create your class. And let's see what

28
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:51,633
goods it comes up with. So, what I'm going to be showing you, in this video, is how to,

29
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:55,633
as I said at the beginning, how to make an AI Controller, which we're doing now.

30
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:59,633
Once that's done, we're going to look at how to assign that AI Controller to

31
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:03,633
the... Just do a recompile. I don't know why it wants to recompile, let's see what happens.

32
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:07,633
We're going to assign the AI Controller to the tank, and then, we're going to get you

33
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:11,633
logging out to show that possession has happened. So, I've got a

34
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:15,633
file compilation error. Let's have a look! C++ 25.

35
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:19,633
Let's see what my problem is here. I've got a Z on the end of a line!

36
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:23,633
So, just to help you out, by the way, if you see something like "unexpected end-of-file", then

37
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:27,633
look out for dodgy stuff (laughs), like a missing character.  So, I had a

38
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:31,633
Z on the end, it didn't like that. Let's go ahead and recompile. So yeah, we're making an AI

39
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:35,633
Controller class, we're going to tell the tank what it's AI Controller class is,

40
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,633
and then, I'll get you to do the logging that we did on the PlayerController, over here on the AI

41
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:43,633
Controller, so that all tanks report in on the log for us, to say that they have been

42
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:47,633
appropriately possessed. So the game will play now, the PlayerController is possessing Tank_

43
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:51,633
BP_C_44, which is the tank right in front of me. The other tank in the

44
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,633
scene is not possessed by an AI Controller yet. You may ask, how on earth do you do that?

45
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,633
Well, let me show you! We've got one tank, remember one unified tank for both us and

46
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:03,633
the PlayerController. So, it's going to be on the tank that we set this, so here's

47
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:07,633
the Tank blueprint, and we're not really interested in the input setup or the

48
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:11,633
Event Graph. In fact, just to throw you off the scent, I'll go back to the construction script,

49
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:15,633
and I'm going to expand out the details panel of the Tank blueprint. This is where we want to

50
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,633
go, right! So, do we Auto Possess the player in

51
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,633
general? No, not in general we do not, we leave

52
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:27,633
that as it is. Do we Auto Possess the AI with an

53
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:31,633
AI? So, this is what it's really saying. Do we Auto Possess with the Player?

54
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:35,633
Well no, not all the tanks, only one tank.

55
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,633
Only the one take that's right in front of us, and that's already working, that's already been Auto Possessed

56
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,633
with the player, because, just to remind you why, because the

57
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:47,633
game mode blueprint tells it to here.Tells it that this

58
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:51,633
is the PlayerController class that, that this is the tank. Alright, so

59
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:55,633
Oh, I just closed Unreal, that wasn't very cleaver! So, what's the next thing? The next thing

60
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:59,633
is, if I tank's in the world and it's not being possessed by the player,

61
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:03,633
it's going to be possessed by the AI. So, that's what we're doing, we're telling the

62
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:07,633
Tank blueprint that we want

63
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:11,633
Actors that are placed in pawns or Actors or Tanks that are placed

64
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:15,633
in the world, to be possessed by the AI. The final thing we have to do is tell it

65
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:19,633
which class, not just a standard AI Controller but with the Tank

66
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:23,633
AIController. That's the thing that's going to do it. Later on, we're going to go the

67
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,633
other way. This time, we're going to make a Blueprint class later, and then, if we need to

68
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:31,633
and then change this to point to the Blueprint class, but we don't need the blueprint

69
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:35,633
right now. We're only going to need the blueprint if we have some parameters we want to tweak or

70
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:39,633
some assets we want to reference, but for now, we can do this in pure C++.

71
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:43,633
Previously, in the PlayerController, we created the Blueprint class first, and than when we

72
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:47,633
needed it, we added a C++ class and reparented it. In this case, we created

73
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:51,633
a C++ class first, and if we need it, we'll create a Blueprint

74
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,633
class later. Cool! So, there we have pointed it to the AIController class!

75
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:59,633
Let's compile and play the game! Now, another way

76
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,633
to get out of the game, apart from F8 to de-possess, is Shift F1. That

77
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,633
will give you your mouse back. Alright, now you can then go into the World Outliner

78
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,633
and we can have a little look at what's going on. We've got Tank_BP20,

79
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:15,633
we have Tank_BP, so there's a couple of tanks in the world. In fact, I will de-possess with

80
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,633
F8, then I can select tanks. Tank_BP20 is possessed by the TankPlayerController.

81
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:23,633
How about this guy over here, this other tank, Tank_BP?

82
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:27,633
Does he have an AI Controller on him yet? Yes he does look, TankAI

83
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:31,633
Controller. You see that right above it?! So we have an AI Controller possessing

84
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:35,633
that tank. That is pretty cool! So, I have a challenge for you,

85
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:39,633
now that we've done that! What I want you to do is to log the possessed tank for the

86
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:43,633
AI Controller. Use similar code to what we did in the previous video on our

87
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:47,633
PlayerController, this'll make sure that you understood it all. Try placing some more

88
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:51,633
tanks in the level, once you've got it working for one, and what you should find is that you get a log

89
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:55,633
entry for each tank, saying that an AI Controller is possessed and then the

90
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:59,633
tank designator, the tank ID. Alright, go ahead pause the video and see if you can make

91
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,633
the same type of logging work for the AI Controller now.

92
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:07,633
Awesome, welcome back! Well, I said

93
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,633
that it's going to be similar. I hope it's going to be very similar to what we did in the Player

94
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:15,633
Controller. So, in the PlayerController we needed a BeginPlay to do this,

95
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:19,633
so I think that in the AI Controller we're going to need something very similar. So, let's go ahead

96
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:23,633
into the ATankAIController header file and give ourselves a begin playback just

97
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,633
like that. Now, how do I know that's going to work? Well actually, the

98
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:31,633
inheritance for the controller is exactly the same isn't it? If we

99
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:35,633
look the Class Viewer and we go to controller,

100
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:39,633
of course. Sorry Mac people, you can't do this, but PC people can now turn off

101
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:43,633
Actors Only. We go Controller, AIController, but you'll remember

102
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:47,633
that you've also got PlayerController see, both under Controller. So, it's got the same inheritance,

103
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:51,633
they're both children of Actor, so therefore we can go ahead and say

104
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:55,633
override the BeingPlay(). Cool! Well, let's also take a leaf out of

105
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:59,633
the book of the PlayerController for the rest of this. In fact,

106
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:03,633
we can pretty much do exactly the

107
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:07,633
same thing. Let's go ahead and do that, TankAIController.cpp.

108
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:11,633
By the way, from the head file, you can right-click and say Toggle Header / Code File in Visual

109
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:15,633
Studio. It'll take you right there. So, with that code pasted in,

110
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:19,633
hoping that we can do things exactly the same way, we just need to change PlayerController to AI

111
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:23,633
Controller.

112
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:27,633
Let's see what happens! Let's go ahead back to Unreal, see if we can

113
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:31,633
compile that! Now, I've heavy handedly

114
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:35,633
cut and pasted it. In fact, I've so heavy handedly cut and pasted it, I know it's not going to work,

115
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:39,633
because look. I'm saying AIPlayer

116
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:43,633
Controller when I should be saying AIController here, so I know that that compile is going to fail.

117
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:47,633
That was too hasty! Let's try again!

118
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,633
So obviously, when you cut and paste

119
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:55,633
code from one class to the other, because of the nuances of C++ it fully qualifies the

120
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:59,633
class names, and that's not going to work. So, I've still got a problem, GetControlledTank is not defined,

121
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:03,633
and that's simply because I've used this GetControlledTank method here but

122
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:07,633
I never declared it in the header file, so we'll do that as well.

123
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:11,633
We'll have a GetControlledTank on both, at least for now, we may not end up with those at the end.

124
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:15,633
There's your getter and your constant

125
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:19,633
getter. Let's try again! So, this method of just compiling and

126
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:23,633
compiling until something runs is fine when your code base is small and the

127
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:27,633
compilation is fast, but if it's not, then it's not a great strategy

128
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:31,633
really long term. You probably want to look at your code a little bit more carefully. But I'm just going to go

129
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:35,633
through this way of going it for you for now, just for run. So, on the 18 I'm

130
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:39,633
missing a semicolon, and that's

131
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:43,633
because I'm not hash including tank here.

132
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:47,633


133
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:51,633
OK, strange error for that isn't it? It just doesn't understand ATank*.

134
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:55,633
It's good to see a variety of different errors, I think, because you're going to get them when you

135
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:59,633
write your won code, and if I just give you totally clinical clean examples, then

136
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:03,633
I think that it's going to be detrimental to the learning. So, there you

137
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:07,633
go now! Let's stop the game and play it! Oh, look at that, "AI

138
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:11,633
Controller not possessing a tank", "PlayerController not possessing a tank". So, that

139
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:15,633
old chestnut! The first thing I'm going to check is that the Tank blueprint... You see the

140
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:19,633
parent class has gone back again. I'm not sure what's going on with my machine here, why it keeps

141
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:23,633
going back, but I'm going to patiently set it once more back to tank. I don't think you'll be

142
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:27,633
having this problem. I'm going to recompile and if it still doesn't

143
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,633
save it for some reason I'll save it out, then I'll look at a solution, but let's

144
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:35,633
just go ahead. Ah there you go! AIController possessing one tank, the other

145
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:39,633
controller is possessing the other. Let's just check those ID's against the Content Browser,

146
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:43,633
the World Outliner rather. These guys go together and

147
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:47,633
then the TankAIController5

148
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:51,633
is possessing Tank_BP there. So yeah, you have to hover

149
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,633
over to be sure, and really to be sure, you have to actually depossess

150
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:59,633
with F8, click the tank to be sure that it's Tank_BP 6,

151
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,633
hover over it in the World Outliner. It shows you that it's BP

152
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:07,633
underscore 569, and then, you can see that the AIController is indeed possessing the

153
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:11,633
correct one. OK, so let's drop another tank in just to finish off

154
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:15,633
that challenge. Now, this gets really easy, because we've got a Tank blueprint. We can just drop another

155
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:19,666
one in the world there, click play. I'm just going to clear this log, right-click,

156
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:23,633
Clear Log. Now you get two messages, two AIControllers possessing

157
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:27,633
two different tanks, and the PlayerController possessing the one in the foreground. Again to check

158
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:31,600
the suggestion, you F8 to come out, click on the tank,

159
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,633
go to the World Outliner, hover over it, it's designated 215.

160
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:39,633
In this case, it's actually in the hierarchy in the World Outliner as well, whereas these guys you need to

161
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:43,633
hover to see, and you can see that all the right things are being possessed by the

162
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:47,633
right PlayerController. So, that is absolute triumph! Congratulations, you

163
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:51,633
now know how to place things in the world and have them possessed by AI or by the player,

164
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:55,633
and let's continue this exciting journey towards a working tank game!

165
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,599
