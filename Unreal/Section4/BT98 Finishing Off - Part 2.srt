
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,733


2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:06,733
Welcome to Finishing Off Part 2! In this video we are

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:10,733
going to make our ground undulate a little bit more like this, so it's a bit more interesting,

4
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:14,733
up and down all over the place. And we will introduce a

5
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:18,733
new mortar type, which one of our students Robert Woo has provided for us.

6
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:22,733
You can see it proudly sitting on the top of the hill there, much more attractive than the one I provided.

7
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:26,733
We'll also make sure that that mortar can be fired into oblivion if we

8
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:30,733
hit it, which I didn't, and we will be

9
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:34,733
generally tidying up and finishing off our work. So I will see you in there!

10
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:35,666


11
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,666
OK, so we've knocked off three of our pick and mix challenge, let's look at the next

12
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,666
one! Use the noise landscape function to undulate... Oh,

13
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:47,666
there's an example of me working too hard for try and make something fit on one line

14
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:51,666
of slide. So let's go and take a look at the Landscaping

15
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:55,666
Tool [Laugh] and then Click on the Sculpt Tool. So

16
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,666
you go to Modes, Landscape, Sculpt, Sculpt Tool, and you get

17
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:03,666
to Noise eventually. Now let's just do a little test. What I want to do is

18
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:07,666
make this landscape less flat. OK, so that is clearly

19
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:11,666
too much undulation, so I'm going to turn the Tool Strength down

20
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:15,666
to 0.02, quite low really. Noise Mode, Both directions,

21
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,666
it's going to raise and lower the terrain. Noise scale, that's the

22
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:23,666
size of the perlin noise filter. Let's just try a few different things. So this is a 15

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,666
NoiseScale there, if you look at what it's done to the terrain, and then, if I go to half

24
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:31,666
way up, let's just take a sample here, very different

25
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,666
wave length, basically, of undulation. And if I went really big,

26
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,666
then I'd think we'd find that you'd hardly even see the undulations. Alright, well I

27
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,666
think that, given those three, I'd like the one in the middle the best. So I'm just going to undo,

28
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,666
go to the middle somewhere, and then, I might just make the brush a little smaller,

29
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:51,666
and then, I think I'm just going to give the landscape

30
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:55,666
some noisy treatment. Let's go ahead and do it. So do the same with yours, just

31
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,666
make it noisy. You'll see these component divisions just come up in the land, as

32
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,666
you do this. I actually may need a little bit more strength. Let's have a look at see what it looks like

33
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,666
down at the ground level. No I think it's OK, it's just giving a natural

34
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:11,666
kind of slightly slightly undulating feel to it. I think I'll go to

35
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,666
0.03, bearing in mind that's a 50% increase in the

36
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,666
Strength. That should be enough! And actually, why am I messing around with such a small

37
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,666
brush? Let's just go to the biggest brush we can get our grubby mitts on! OK

38
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:27,666
there you go! Oh, that's too much!

39
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:31,666
Now look, you can spend a lot more time than I'm going to,

40
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,666
because watching me do this is not the most amount of fun you'll have ever had,

41
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,666
but the idea is to introduce a little bit of undulation, a little

42
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,700
bit of change and uncertainty in the landscape, so that we're not driving around

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,666
on a flat plane. And try not to get too many

44
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,666
artifacts of the tool in there like that, so if you have the tool too strong when you

45
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,666
click around on it, you're going to get these artifacts come in. Let's

46
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,666
try this, this looks a bit more crazy to me. OK, remember you need

47
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,666
to come out of the Landscaping Mode, or it just doesn't work properly.

48
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,666
I'm grabbing my controller, that's what the clutter was, and here we go! There is a tank down in the

49
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,666
valley there, let's boost him! Oh I can't, because he's below my

50
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,666
aim capability! Who's going to reload first? He is! Uh oh,

51
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,666
I'm in trouble! OK, but look you get the idea straight away. It's much more interesting

52
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,666
when you've got this undulating landscape. So that's what I want you to do, is

53
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,666
one of the things, is go and make your landscape undulate. Now, the other thing I notice

54
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,666
about my landscape, I think I'm going to go to a top view, is that if we look

55
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,666
for the NavMeshBoundsVolume it's too small, so let's just make that larger.

56
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,666
So NavMeshBoundsVolume there, and with the appropriate

57
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:43,666
place, you should be able to drag it. If you can't drag it like that, just go to its Details and

58
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,666
just change its X and Y size up appropriately. So let's just reset its

59
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,666
position there, and then, just make it bigger

60
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,666
than the landscape.

61
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,666
And that's great! OK, so now if we go back to the Perspective and

62
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,666
hit P for Show and what that will do

63
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:07,666
is show Navigation. P hits show Navigation like that, in a single fell

64
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,666
swoop. So how's that looking? Well the problem actually is

65
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,666
that the NavMeshBoundsVolume is not deep enough now. You see that the AI tanks will never be able to get

66
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,666
into the bottom of these holes, so we do need to go and reselect the NavMeshBoundsVolume.

67
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,666
You need to pay attention to the three dimensionality of it, and we do need to make it deeper.

68
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,666
So I'm going to make it quite a lot deeper, and now, we need to

69
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,666
probably have a look from one of the sides and say, well how's that looking?

70
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,666
Well it's looking OK, I would say. It needs to be lower, as an offset.

71
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,666
There you go, now it goes into the bottom of all the holes and crevices in the ground!

72
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,666
Now let's let the calculation recalculate. And it

73
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,666
should be able to get, apart from the very steepest bits of slope, which is fine, it should now

74
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,666
give us the situation where your AI tank can get from any part of a landscape

75
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,666
to any other part, perhaps apart from these deepest crevices like this one here.

76
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,666
So that should be fine! Let it finish calculating your navigation, and that part of

77
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,666
the challenge is done! Of course, mine is very very rough and ready, but you get the

78
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,666
idea. The NavMeshBoundsVolume needs to extend in three dimensions into

79
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:11,666
the areas where you want that tank to be able to go. Probably not right to the top of your biggest hills,

80
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,666
probably, yes, down to the bottom of your deepest valleys,

81
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,666
and that is kind of what you're looking for. And you can always verify things in like a Left View

82
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,666
or a side view, etc. So give yourself a little bit more

83
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,666
Z height, if you need to, play around with it

84
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,666
till eventually it fills in to where you want it to be. Bear in mind, in the Left View here, you

85
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,666
don't get to see everything necessary, so you may need it higher in Z than

86
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,666
you think you do, in order to get the ground level in. OK

87
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,666
cool! So that's going through calculating one final time and then that

88
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:49,200
will be done! So while that's calculating, let's go look at the next thing! Make the AutoMortars damageable. OK,

89
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,200
so when it comes to mortars, our students have provided some mortars for us. If you look

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
against this lecture, in the resources, we have a Student AutoMortar as a .zip file.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,200
In there, I'm going to use Robert Wu's. The other guy's will also work. They're different styles

92
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,200
for you, but they will maybe need some changes to the import settings, I'll show you

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,200
as we go through. So if I grab Robert Wu's pack here, I'm probably just going

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,200
to export this .zip first, actually, because if we don't it may not

95
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,200
drag into Unreal properly. So there you go, that's exported! Robert Wu, and there's some

96
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,200
.fbx's. So I think what I'll do is just grab the

97
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,200
base, for a start, and just drop it into the Mortar folder in Unreal here,

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
something like that. That brings up an import dialog. I'm going to leave

99
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
the Import Rotation and Translation the same, but you may need to change that for the other models.

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Import All and there we go, we have a different base to the mortar.

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,200
So now, if you go into the Mortar Blueprint, go to the Body, you can now

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
come in and say, well OK let's go find Robert's base, and there it is!

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,200
OK that's cool! So that's done that bit and now we have that base,

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,200
and of course, you're going to need to go to the base and create a socket

105
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
in it. Now I'm going to do this by eye, it's called Dome, the socket,

106
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,200
or was it turret? I don't remember but we'll change it if it's not right. Then, you move that up

107
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,200
to the middle of the base like that and Save.

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,200
OK cool, so next bit! We need to go down to the Dome

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
and we switch that out. Now, of course, Robert's dome isn't imported, so we just go find

110
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,200
both the turret and the barrel, the turret being the dome,

111
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
and you drag them into the Mortar folder.

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I Import All and then, we've got those

113
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,200
models now! Now, on our mortar, we can go to the Dome and we can switch that out for

114
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,200
very fancy looking triple gun dome thing there.

115
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,200
There you go! And we had got the socket name right and it does look like it's sitting

116
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,200
about right, possibly a tiny bit low, but I think we'll roll with that!

117
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,200
OK, and then the Barrel, finally! So now, we need to go find Robert's

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,200
altogether superior triple set of barrels, somewhere in here.

119
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,200
There you go! And then, of course, on the Dome itself, we need to go to the model,

120
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,200
we need to go and create ourselves

121
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,200
a socket called Barrel.

122
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm not entirely sure where that socket needs to be in Robert's model, so I'm going to try just

123
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,200
somewhere like this. I'm not sure,

124
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,200
has Robert provided any instructions? Let's have a look! No, not a text file. So it is helpful, by the

125
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,200
way, if you're making models, like I think John did, to make a read me which talks about the attachement

126
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,200
points. But that doesn't matter, we can look at these attachment points. I'm super grateful for everybody's

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
work, it really doesn't matter. And there you can see that,

128
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,200
actually, it's the left-hand barrel socket I need to be aiming at, plus I need to be a little bit farther

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
forward. So remember, that when you do this, you can when you're

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
specifying a barrel here, on your socket manager, you can choose a

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
preview mesh, and that' makes a lot of sense. So let's go choose that preview mesh there.

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Now it's much more easy for me to position that barrel, much more

133
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
precisely, because I can see the result without having to flip back and forth

134
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
to the blueprint as a whole.

135
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
OK, so if I now just go for something like that, I can even preview in here

136
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,200
the idea, well I can preview certainly over on the Mortar,

137
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
the idea of rotating these barrels. Now this Barrel socket

138
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
has changed, so we need to just reparent the socket there. While I'm at it, I might

139
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
as well make sure that that's correct. Cool! Now let's just rotate these guys,

140
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
and they're pretty close, I would say. Fantastic! So what else do we need to check? We need to check that

141
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
the AimingComponent still has a projectile, which it doesn't. And we should

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
be good to go, it's all facing down positive X. Let's try it! Let's drop

143
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
without P. I'm going to hit P to get rid of that in the scene. Let's drop Robert's into

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
the scene. I'm just going to work out where the Player Start is, so it's quite close to us,

145
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
and let's drop one of Robert's Mortars right here. End Key remember,

146
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
snaps things to the ground level. Let's play the game!

147
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Now I didn't save, so the Mortar blue, if it does crash here, which it shouldn't

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
with all our ensure assertions, but if it does crash, I'll lose something in the Mortar Blueprint. That's

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
OK. I don't like how long that took to run, so I'm just going to see if there's an ensure

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
that's failed. Indeed there is, there's a PossessedTank

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
ensure that's failed. So I'll just get rid of the tank in the scene

152
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
and just focus purely on the Mortar, for now. Clear this

153
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Log, play again. OK let's have a look! Is this mortar...

154
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Ah, look how good that looks! Thank you very much, Robert, that looks pretty

155
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
awesome! So the final thing is, it's kind of hitting itself, and this is way beyond

156
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
your challenge, call of duty, by the way. Of course, I'm doing a load more here, and the

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
reason it's hitting itself is that the Barrel, we don't have a

158
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
projectile socket on it yet.

159
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
So it needs a proper Projectile socket on, I'll move that

160
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
to the middle barrel and slightly ahead of the barrels,

161
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
and that should sort of the firing. Let's have a go!

162
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
It's looking really sharp, as far as I'm concerned, that Mortar.

163
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Boom! And it can hit us! Awesome! So finally, to make that thing

164
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
damageable, all we need to do is go to the Mortar, to the Body of the

165
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Mortar, simulate some physics. I'm going to give it a massive, I don't know, this looks like

166
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
about a 10 ton to 10000 barrel to me. Give it

167
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
some Linear and Angular Damping, if you like. Leave Gravity

168
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
off, because it's just going to sit on the ground, and that should be enough, just those changes there.

169
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
You can see what I've changed, by the way, by where the little yellow resets are. They're the things

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
that I've changed, it helps you guide your eye. OK, so let's just save

171
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
everything, play the game, and see what

172
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
happens if I shoot now, this mortar. Well firstly, it's not

173
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
doing so well. He's had a bit of a problem there, so let's just see if

174
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
he just may have been colliding with the ground. Let's try again, moved it up a little bit.

175
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,200
That's better! And if I shoot this guy, what happens!

176
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Well let's see! Boom, now he goes absolutely flying

177
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,200
off! Well that's not damage to such, but he has gone

178
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
completely disappearing. I think he may be too heavy. If he was lighter than that,

179
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
he'd disappear at even higher speed. So you might be asking now, well why don't I just

180
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,200
implement damage ability in the same way as we did on the tank? Well we could but I don't

181
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
think it's really necessary, because I want to show you the feature of Unreal that if this

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
mortar goes flying off to a sufficient distance, like imagine it was only 100 kilos

183
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
when we hit it, then see what happens. I want you to see that it actually does

184
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
clear up objects for you, when they get to an unreasonably large distance

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
away in the world and there's not chance of them coming back. Let's see that in action!

186
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
So I'm now going to try again, try and get a nice direct hit on this mortar.

187
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I think is quite funny that it then goes absolutely boosting off. If

188
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
you then depossess and then go

189
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
and inspect, by going to the World Outliner, that mortar if you can find it somewhere

190
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
in here, you can always do a search by the way, you'll see that that mortar

191
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
is still flying away and the reason

192
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,200
it's stopped and hanging in the air here is because of the Linear Damping.

193
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
So if we are to get rid of Linear Damping on the mortar altogether...

194
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,200
We could even get rid of Angular Damping, actually. There's no reason this thing should

195
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
just go flying off wildly. I was only putting those in out of habit, because real things have

196
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
those. Now let's just hit it again! Boom! And that goes

197
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
absolutely flying, up into the air, [Laughs] very funny!

198
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Now what happens to it? Let's track it! Let's go to F8 to

199
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,200
depossess. The World Outliner, let's go find that mortar! Ah, it just got deleted! Too late!

200
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh no it didn't, that was a different object. Here you go! Now here's the mortar.

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
If you look at it's details it's miles and miles away, now let's look at this location.

202
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
It's just moving further and further away from us,

203
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
and what you'll find, if you wait a little while is that that mortar will actually get to a threshold where

204
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
it's completely deleted. It's already out of range, it already can't find an aim solution.

205
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
It's not really causing us a performance problem right now, because it's so

206
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,200
far away that it's not going to be rendering, it won't be able to find an aim solution,

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,200
so we're just waiting for that mortar to get to a point where it gets deleted now. So I'm going to just

208
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
use that as the very basic solution to making the mortars damageable.

209
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,200
What I'd like you to do later, once you've done the next section of the course, and

210
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,200
maybe even further content than that, is to loop back here and think about creating some sort of

211
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
damageable interface, that could apply to both the mortar and the tank, but that's a little bit

212
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
beyond the scope of this section. So that's how I'm going to do it and that makes the mortar

213
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,200
disreputable and ejectable and not damageable as such, but we can

214
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,200
certainly get it out of here so it doesn't do us anymore harm. Just boost it completely out

215
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,200
of the world, that's a lot of fun! So the final challenge was to look through the Unreal coding

216
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
standards and make sure we're complying with it. I think that, in general, we're doing very well up to

217
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,200
the point that it talks about Comments, at least, which is all I wanted you to get

218
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,200
to, just up to here, not even going into Const correctness. The only thing is,

219
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,200
it does talk a fair amount about bools and what we need to do about bools and how you name

220
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,200
boolean methods, but unfortunately, the engine itself breaks those

221
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
rules. So in methods like this, if we just search

222
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,200
for "bool" GetSightRayHitLocation, it's not obvious

223
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,200
that the bool is saying yes I've succeeded or no I've failed. But if

224
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,200
you look at the methods that surround that, that the engine actually uses they go like this,

225
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,200
they behave like this, and they don't use the B prefix, and they don't start

226
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,200
with is. So what the coding standard says is that

227
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,200
properties that are boolean should start with b, lower case b,

228
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,200
it's the only variables that do start with lowercase, and methods should start with the word is,

229
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,200
but with this case, we're breaking the rule with these HitLocation and  hit vectors, because I

230
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,200
think it reads a little bit better and, as I say, they break the rule in the engine themselves.

231
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
So everywhere else I think we're doing OK. IsBarrelMoving is an

232
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,200
is question, bHaveAimSolution in a property here starts with a b.

233
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,200
So in general I think we've fairly well complied with the coding standards, there's probably one or two little things

234
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,200
that don't, but you know the point is to get 95% the way there and I think we've

235
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,200
done that. So well done, that game's shaped up really nicely, and

236
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I will, in the next video, challenge you to come

237
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,200
back here and continue to improve and develop this game, once you've learned some more tools

238
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,733
from the next section!
