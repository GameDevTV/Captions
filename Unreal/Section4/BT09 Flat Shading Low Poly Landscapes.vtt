2
00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:08.000
So, welcome to Flat Shading Low Poly Landscapes! What we're going to do in this video

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is quite a lot actually, and you don't need to understand all of the details.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We will revisit some of these things later. This would be five or six videos, if we go into too

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
much detail. But the end result will be, I will show you how to make a landscape with a lot lower

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
geometric detail like this, where you can actually come in and

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
paint on the landscape, in very simple flat colors,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
like your grass here or your dirt. And where we create

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a very special type of material which uses this collection of

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
nodes, which I'll briefly explain but not go into a huge amount of detail about how it works,

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to make the terrain flat shade, which is what's giving this effect here where

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
each of these faces are looking like flat faces.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
OK, that's the magic source is what we do in here with these nodes. So, let's dive in

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and show you how to create the option for a low poly terrain, if that's your preference.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.400


16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.400
So, before you make your decision, whether you want to pursue the high poly

17
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.400
route or the low poly route, I just want to talk about the implications. One of the things

18
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.400
is that Unreal's tools are actually really powerful and will help you make a very photo

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.400
real looking external landscape, with only a few more hours work than we've done so far.

20
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.400
The disadvantage of that is that, you've just set the bar for the rest of your game.

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
Now suddenly, if a player sees the scenery is that realistic, they're probably going to expect

22
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.400
everything else they see to be realistic. There are ways around this.

23
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.400
Think of games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, for example,

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.400
or Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. Those type of games are absolutely beautiful

25
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.400
environments, but there's very little interactivity. You see, if you want a

26
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.400
photo real environment with photo real characters, like GTA 5

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.400
type thing, you're talking about spending 1,000 man years of effort

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.400
to produce it, and a lot of that goes into the art, sound, stroytelling,

29
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.400
etc. etc. So, be careful how high you set the bar. Some people may choose

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400
to set a low poly bar for all of their assets, and

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.400
then, you can really focus on the core gameplay. So, let's see how we would make this low poly.

32
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400
What we're going to do is just go to the World Outliner and

33
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.400
delete the landscape. Now, if you choose, by the way, to stick with high poly,

34
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.400
as I said just don't do this, just watch this through out of interest, and in the challenge you can use

35
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400
the time, instead of making a low poly landscape, you can use that time to tweak your existing

36
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400
landscape. But I'm going to go ahead and nuke my landscape, bravely, and I'm going to make a new one.

37
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.400
Now, this new one, the difference is going to be that the X and the Y scale are going to be

38
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.400
1,000 centimeters or 10 meters. So, these quads are 10 meter

39
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.400
quads now, what's what make it low poly. Now, 500 loads of 10

40
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.400
meters is a bit too big, this is a 5 by 5 kilometer terrain right now.

41
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.400
So, I'm going to drop the number of quads and the number of components,

42
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.400
till we get to 106 by 106, so that's 1.06 kilometers

43
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400
on either side. Same sort of scale as before with much less

44
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.400
quad density, much lower density of information that we can put in,

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.400
in terms of the shape of the terrain. So that's it, there's our new terrain

46
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.400
layout! Now, let's go start in just a small region, and I'll

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400
show you how to do the low poly stuff. And if you're going down this route, I'll give you plenty of time in the challenge.

48
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.400
Same stuff, we model, we pull up, and if I'm going to do it from a slightly lower

49
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400
viewpoint. Now, it's not actually super apparent how

50
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.400
kind of low poly this is, right now, because this preview mesh that we have

51
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.400
here is actually what we call smooth shaded right now, which means that the

52
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.400
lighting is treating this surface as if it's smooth. What we're going to have to

53
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.400
do is try and force the system to start shading this landscape, as

54
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.400
if everything is flat, and that's a little bit trickier than we may

55
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.400
hope and I'll show you how to do it right now. So, here is a piece of

56
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.400
landscape. We can imagine putting mountains around the rest, but let's show you how to get to the shading that we want.

57
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.400
What we do is make ourselves a new

58
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.400
material. I'm just going to call it Flat,

59
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.400
FlatLand. OK, so I've got a material called FlatLand. Remember

60
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.400
with a landscape material, the first thing you want to do is scroll down to Usage and say Used

61
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.400
with Landscape, as we did before. Fantastic! Now, this is where the voodoo

62
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.400
starts coming in. How on earth are we going to make this

63
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.400
multi-colored? Well, firstly we're going to play the same trick as we did

64
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.400
before, with the base colors. In fact, you could have duplicated your landscape,

65
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.400
that's another way of doing it. Let's do that actually. Let me just, rather than

66
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.400
making FlatLand like this, let's duplicate Landscape and then

67
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.400
call it FlandLand. OK, there's an alternative for you.

68
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.400
If you go into that, of course, it'll already have these two colors, OK,

69
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.400
and it's already setup as a landscape texture. So, let's try using this

70
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.400
one, this FlatLand texture on this new landscape. So,

71
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.400
there's the landscape, enter details, choose FlatLand. Now we

72
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.400
need to go ahead and paint, of course, so popping over to there.

73
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.400
Now, of course, your paint... You won't be able to see what's going on with this painting, until your shaders

74
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.400
have finished compiling. So, let's just give those a moment to finish compiling.

75
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.400
And we're going to need to make ourselves new

76
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.400
layer information. You see it's saying there's no layer information assigned? So, let's go ahead

77
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.400
and make new layer information layers. Now,

78
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.400
sometimes it can get stuck in a dialog here, so we may need to just select elsewhere. There

79
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.400
we go! So, Grass_LayerInfo_Flat

80
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.400
is what I'm going to call this one, and this is the map

81
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.400
of where the grass is and then Dirt_LayerInfo_Flat.

82
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.366
Cool! Now we have the layers, we're able to start

83
00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:28.400
painting the grass, and here it goes! So, there's the grass on the low lands,

84
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.400
here in front of me, fine, and then, the dirt and we could worry about snow

85
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400
a little bit later. Now, if this happens to you, it all just goes wrong like this. This is just because the shaders

86
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.400
need to recompile, so bear with it for a second and it will come back

87
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.400
in a second. OK, here we go! Now, you want the Tool Strength to be  very high, so you don't end up with

88
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.400
a mix of two different things. And you can see that OK, sure,

89
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.400
it's low poly, but it doesn't really look low poly. This is not what we mean by low poly,

90
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.400
and the reason is, the way the shader is shading this stuff

91
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.400
smoothly. So, how are we going to make it shade non-smoothly? Now that we've got a

92
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.400
landscape like this, let me show you. I'm going to go back. Have I got it open? No.

93
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.400
I'm going to go back to my Content and

94
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.400
then back to the root, FlatLand. What we're going to need to do is something a bit

95
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.400
cleaver, with the normals. Normals are little lines the affectively stick out

96
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.400
of the surface of the vertices. They stick out of each of the vertices on the

97
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.400
landscape, and they tell the shader how light should interact with that

98
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.400
surface. What we need to do is, we need to make all of the

99
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.400
normals, for a given flat face, point in the same direction. So,

100
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.400
if we were to, instead of being in lit mode here, if we were to go in say

101
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.400
Wireframe mode... I'm just going to suppress the Sky Sphere

102
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.400
for a moment. There you go! These are the quads, you can see them. What's

103
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.400
happening is that little normals are sticking out of all of these vertices

104
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.400
at an angle, that's kind of the average of all the faces around it. Little

105
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.400
hairs are effectively sticking out. And then, what the shader is doing is, if I've got a normal sticking

106
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.400
out of this vertex up into the air and another one sticking out down here, the

107
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.400
shader is interpolating all along the line, so that it

108
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.400
assumes that you didn't actually want this thing to be as rigid as it is, that you want it to appear

109
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.400
smooth. So, it interpolates in between and we get this overly

110
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.400
smooth result. We're going to have to force all

111
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.400
normals, that are on the same face, to point in the same direction,

112
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.400
so that this entire triangle, for example, that I'm highlighting now,

113
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.400
has exactly the same angle to the light, rather than having little

114
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.400
hairs that stick out, in a very organic way. Imagine that the

115
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.400
mesh here is like the skin of an animal and that their normals are hairs sticking on the skin,

116
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.400
and those normals tell the light how to interact with it. You can find out a lot more about normals

117
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.400
by just searching, for example, on Google.

118
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.400
And here, there's a picture of normals there, from Autodesk. These are

119
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.400
face normals. We're actually using vertex normals inside

120
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.400
Unreal, which is more like this sphere here. You see each vertex has a little hair sticking

121
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.400
out. What we're wanting is, each pixel wants to be treated

122
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.400
as if every normal points in the same direction, let me show you. This is quite advanced, so if you just want to

123
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.400
use this technology rather than fully understand it for now, that's absolutely fine.

124
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.400
So, what we're going to do is go and find ourselves,

125
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.400
from the Coordinates dropdown, there's a node called WorldPosition

126
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.400
OK, and what that's going to tell us is, it's going to give us a map

127
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.400
of the WorldPosition from our viewpoint. Now it doesn't actually matter whether it's the

128
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.400
Absolute World Position or the Camera Relative World Position, but it gives a

129
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.400
vector to the surface at every point. That's the point from where we're

130
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.400
standing. Let me carry on, then explain in context how this works, alright.

131
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.400
Now, this is where it gets really weird. We're going to use a couple of features that we can

132
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.400
pull off the shader, called DDX and DDY,

133
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.400
and these are partial differentials in X and Y, which is quite mathematical.

134
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.400
But what we're saying here, by taking a differential in X and Y,

135
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.400
is we're saying when we look at this landscape, as we're doing now...

136
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.400
Let's put it into Wireframe. We want

137
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.400
to say find me places where the change

138
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.400
of slope, or whether slope in X and Y it doesn't really matter whether

139
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.400
X and Y is the world space X and Y or screen space, but in two dimensions,

140
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.400
the slope is not changing basically. We only want to change the shading

141
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.400
at an edge, when the slope of the face changes. So, we're finding

142
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.400
the slope of the face or the slope of the thing we're looking at, in two dimensions here with this

143
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.400
DDX and DDY. Then, we're going to do something called a

144
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.400
maths CrossProduct between the two,

145
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.400
and what that does is, it makes us a little vector, effectively makes us a face normal. It

146
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.400
makes a bunch of lines stick out of the face at 90 degrees,

147
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.400
one for each pixel, and we pump that into the normal. Now that is not

148
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.400
intuitive. It's the sort of solution you'll find on the web, but no one will explain exactly how it works.

149
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.400
We're going to have to do this in a spiral way. I could sit and teach you about

150
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.400
CrossProducts and Partial Differentials, and we'd be here another 10 hours before you've got all

151
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.400
the requisite knowledge. So, the point of this set of nodes here,

152
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.400
that I've just made, is to force all

153
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.400
of the pixels to be rendered the same until you get to a change of face. That's the idea. Let's

154
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.400
see it in practice. we're overriding the normal vectors

155
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.400
for the pixels of our terrain.

156
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.400
So, you click Save, once it's finished saving you can come out of it, but then, you're

157
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.400
going to have to wait until you can see the effect.

158
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.400


159
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.400
So, here is the preview again! Ah, you see now that's doing exactly what we want.

160
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.400
The blending is a little bit weird in places but that is what we're after.

161
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.400
OK, and then given that, you can even just come back to the landscape tools

162
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.566
and we can just take the dirt, paint the dirt where we want it, and

163
00:10:44.566 --> 00:10:48.400
we can paint the grass where we want it. And we can raise and lower the terrain and all

164
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.400
the things that we've been doing before. Sculpt,

165
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.400
Circle Brush, nice large brush you see, and we're actually

166
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.400
generating a low poly terrain. Now, we get some blending between the different cells,

167
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.400
so the green and the gray blend into each other,

168
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.400
but that's absolutely fine, that's pretty manageable.

169
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.400
So, back to paint, for example, come here and put some dirt up here, and

170
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.400
you see that's working, so we have a low poly terrain setup. So what I'm going to leave on the

171
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.400
screen is this node setup for you. This we will

172
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.400
revisit this type of stuff, as and when necessary, but just

173
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.400
bear in mind we are detecting flatness basically and forcing

174
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.400
faces to shade flat, because unfortunately with a landscape type

175
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.400
material there's no simple button we can click to say render this flat or certainly nothing that

176
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.400
I know of. You could add in a third color here. You would just add in another vector

177
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.400
parameter, which you would put in, say snow, and then, you would have three colors.

178
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.400
So, that's what I want you to do! I want you to choose your final landscape style! Decide which

179
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.400
route you want to pursue. If it's high poly, then use this time to tweak the existing terrain

180
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.400
you've got. I'm going to pursue high poly, I think, through the rest of the course, because

181
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.400
that's been the consensus. I want to show you, in the upcoming iteration of

182
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.400
terrain, I want to show you how to use Height Maps and import those sort of things. So, ultimately

183
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.400
I'm showing you both techniques. But if you decide low poly, then create your initial landscape like

184
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.400
I just did. Remember to leave a flat area in the middle of that landscape,

185
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.400
and then, share the result with the rest of us so we can see, either on

186
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.400
Facebook or in the Questions and Answers, what you've done, because we'll be really interested to see your

187
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.400
low poly result. I'm not going to flesh my low poly terrain out anymore, as I say,

188
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.400
because on the next iteration, I'm going to show you how to import a Height Map, as a third

189
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.966
alternative to terrain generation.
