Hi, and welcome to Battle Tank! This is going to be an open

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
world, head to head to head, tank battle game, just you against one

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
other tank, with only the terrain to get in the way. They'll be a heavy

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
focus on the control systems here and how we really get into the nuances of

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
controlling something like a tank, but there will also be some basic AI in the enemy

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
tank or another local player can take control. We're going to be looking

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
at a simple User Interface. We're going to be looking at creating and sculpting a

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
very simple terrain and there's going to be a lot more stuff, apart from

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that in this section. So, what I want you to do is start

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
off with a little challenge, even in this intro video, which is I want you to go ahead and

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
do some research about tank games. Watch at least one YouTube

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
video of a tank moving. Watch at least one YouTube of a tank game,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why not play World of Tanks! World of Tanks is free and it's multi-platform.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Take some notes on the controls, on the features of the game,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and on the challenges that you may come across when you're trying to develop

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
this game, and then, share your notes with us, before moving on,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,466
and we'll look at the Game Design Document next!
