00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.233
Hey! So, in this video I'd like to

2
00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:08.000
introduce you to A Landscaping Process. It's not the landscaping process. The process

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm going to suggest is that we start off, number 1, by sculpting hills, valleys, and flat areas.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Number 2, by then smoothing, flattening, and, if we want, putting ramps in

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to create useful features in the landscape. We'll add some erosion and noise

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to make the whole thing feel more organic, and then, in the future videos, not in this one,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we'll be painting the landscape using layered materials for snow lines and tree

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
lines and all that sort of stuff, and then, adding details, foliage, trees,

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
etc. But we're going to focus on the first three here. In fact, let's start with the

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
first one. So here's your terrain. Remember how you can move around it? One of the easiest ways

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is to hold down the Right Mouse Button, push W, A, S, D, on the

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
keyboard to move back in the first person controls, remembering that as you roll the Mouse

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Wheel you either move faster or slower OK. I'll be able to get

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
myself fairly high off the ground and start from there. Now, I suggest you just watch me for a few

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
minutes. I will introduce you to the process, and then, you'll have plenty of opportunity in the

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
challenge to go ahead and go crazy and make your own terrain. So we go to the

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Modes tab, to Landscape, and then to Sculpt. We start on the left-hand side with the sculpt

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
tool. In fact, we're going to work down in this order Sculpt, Smooth, Flatten, Ramp, Erosion,

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Noise. OK, so we're going to go to the top one, then the next three, then the next three. So,

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
once you have the Sculpt tool, we then want to say, well what shape? Circle, whatever. We're going to

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
stick with circle, and the falloff tells you whether it's a smooth

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
falloff. It shows you here the type of land it's going to make. Spherical is an interesting

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
one, by the way. If you start trying to paint in Spherical land, then it creates you these

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
really weird bubbles like this, which on a smaller scale could be quite good for say lava.

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But we're just going to go with the default here, Sculpt with a Circle Brush with a

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
smooth falloff alright. Cool, so let me quickly talk about what these settings

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
do. So, what's the brush size? Well, it's the size of the outer circle. You can just see a very

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
faint white outer circle in centimeters. So in this case,

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it's 8,000 centimeters which is 81.9 meters, which is about

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
a tenth of the terrain. It's about the size of one of these blocks

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
or it's roughly that size. You've then got the Brush Falloff, which

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
tells you how big the circle inside is. So, if we have no falloff, we immediately create a

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
perfectly sharp edged piece of terrain, which looks really weird, and

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
if we have lots of brush falloff then we have a much gentler tool. So, I'm going to go for

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
a medium middle ground. The other thing to know about is Tool Strength. With

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
no Tool Strength it will do nothing. With maximum Tool Strength it'll create Pinocchio's

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
nose, before you can blink. Look at that, out it comes!

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
OK, so we want to go for a sensible Tool Strength, that allows us to paint our

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
terrain as quickly as possible, but without

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
losing control of what we're doing. Alright, so you

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
can mess around with those. What I want to do or suggest that you do as well is, leave an area in the middle.

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
About half the area in the middle is flat and open,

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but what we want to do is have somewhere bounding the play space. So, the first job to do really

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
is just to go around the outside of the play space, however you see fit, and just to make some

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
hills. You can cut the corners off in an organic way, and it doesn't

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
really matter how crazy looking they are, you can spend a lot of time in your challenge doing this and making your

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
terrain look beautiful. I suggest you just watch my overview first, because you'll come up with

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
lots of ideas about terrain features you can make. You may want to use a Spherical

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Falloff Brush and layer that down the side of a hill to make something that looks a bit like

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
lava. You don't have to go entirely around the edges, you can do weird stuff like this.

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Coming in a little bit, hitting the edge again, cutting the corners off. You know,

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the more kind of organic it can feel the better really, and the idea is to make slopes that are too

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
steep for our tank to go up. We won't know that for sure yet, until we get in the tank and try it,

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but this is the point of an iterative process. Don't worry about these scars on the land,

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
they'll go when we build the lighting. But you can see that very very quickly, from down here at

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
ground level, we have a bounded terrain now. It's clearly, we're surrounded

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
by a bunch of impossible mountains. So that's step 1 in the terrain creation. Create

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
your hills, valleys, and flat areas. We don't really have many valleys here, it's kind of a

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
valley going into this corner. You might want to create more valleys than this. It's up to you OK.

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Oops, excuse me! I'll leave it to your creative flair. So the next

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
stage is smooth, flatten, and ramp, creating useful features in your terrain.

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So again, in this first iteration of this terrain, remember it's just the first iteration,

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
we don't need to spend too long on this. So, we go Modes, Sculpt, Sculpt Tool. You must move down

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to the next which is Smooth. So, you have a look around and you look for areas of

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the land that are a bit jagged or not smooth, and you can just rub over them and

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it will smooth out anything that looks a bit weird, like the top of these really knobby hills here,

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
etc. OK, another thing to tell you, by the way, back at

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Sculpt is, you can hold down the Shift button, and that will actually lower the land. It will just

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
do the opposite, it will drop the terrain. So that's a very easy, holding down Shift,

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
way of dropping these things that look a bit nuts here.

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
OK, so Smoothing, and then Flattening does exactly what it sounds like. If you want

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to create a mess or table area you can flatten. Now, be careful with

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that tool. Control Z will get you out if you're in trouble. You can see all the same

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
set of parameters, Brush Size, etc., but firstly, the strength can be a bit

75
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
strong. And also, you want to know the Flatten Target height,

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
so this is a very low Flatten Target height. We might want

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
to, it's an Unreal unit so that's centimeters. So, say I wanted a 100 meter high

78
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
wall, then I would need to put 100 with two zeros on the end, to get that

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
many centimeters, and then, I'm flattening to 100 meters high. That's what's happening there

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
you see, and this is far too powerful and fast. And I

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
don't really need to do it for my purposes, but that's how you flatten.

82
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
You would then Ramp, if you wanted to. Let's not do this in this version, but that will create an actual strict

83
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
ramp. You create a start point and an end point like this. You choose a width and

84
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
you literally add a ramp in the terrain. It can be pretty cool for the tank later, but it looks very artificial

85
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
right. It looks very manmade. I wouldn't put manmade features in until we do that, until we decide

86
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
to make it look manmade. So ramping is that. Now, erosion is quite

87
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
interesting. It's got lots and lots of properties here, which actually you can just play with

88
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
it, I don't need to tell you what they do. But you can start eroding the land and that

89
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
just gives it a little bit more of an organic feel, and I would say it's

90
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
worth doing that. Just possibly everywhere but probably not on the ground

91
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
areas, it's a bit weird to have the flat ground eroded, so you might just want to go around

92
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and erode the sides of the hills something like this. It's very quick and easy

93
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
to do. Yes it's adding complexity to the terrain, but it shouldn't affect the performance

94
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
much, because the quads are already there. All you're doing is deforming and moving these

95
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
quads that are already there a little bit. So I think that it's a good thing

96
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
to do, you add entropy, disorder, or

97
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
you know organic feeling nature

98
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
to the terrain, by making it just less uniform less

99
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
smooth. So, definitely I would suggest it's worth putting at least some

100
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in there without going crazy. And then, you've got other tools like Hydro

101
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Erosion and Noise. Noise can raise some interesting effects. Be careful with it, it's very strong. Look what it

102
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
does to the terrain! It's crazy, looks very very unnatural, but a little bit of noise,

103
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
so very low strength noise may be a good thing for you to have a play

104
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
with. So, you can just have a play with that, but I don't really like it. You have to

105
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
get the right Noise Scale, otherwise your features are too small. So, with

106
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the high Noise Scale and a low strength, you may find that a bit of noise,

107
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
again typically on the slopes, will

108
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
just make things feel and look a little bit more organic. Now, obviously they're no

109
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
textures on this landscape, at the moment, but that will obviously change

110
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
later. We'll talk about how the texturing and the laying works, and then, we can

111
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
actually make this thing look a lot more interesting. So I'm just standing kind of in a middle viewpoint here,

112
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
just roughly slapping on some noise OK, and the final thing

113
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I want to do is just go down to the ground layer. I'm going to rebuild the

114
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
lighting. Build lighting only to, let's just say, Preview quality. That's

115
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
good enough. And then, that will get rid of all of these artifacts, and I'll just have

116
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
a quick buzz around the landscape and we're pretty much done. It'll be time to send you into

117
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
a challenge, which is to actually do this stuff yourself. Now, while

118
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I wait for the lighting to build, let's recap the process. You sculpt the hills, valleys, flat areas.

119
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Smooth, flatten and ramp. I would avoid the ramps for now.

120
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Then, do your erosion and noise, make it look more organic, and then later, and they're in

121
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
gray because we're not doing them in this video, we're going to paint.

122
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We're going to create some layered materials, and then, paint those on for things like you know low lying green

123
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
grass lands and then maybe rocky slopes and then maybe snowy tops to

124
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
mountains but not all in one video. And then, we'll add details later. Things like foliage, trees,

125
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
etc. We probably won't do any of that, actually, until we've got a vehicle in

126
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and we've started to work on that side of things. I want to iterate around the whole loop,

127
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the whole process. This terrain is an OK starting point.

128
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So, let's go back, let my lighting build finish, and then, it'll be time to pop you into a

129
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
challenge. We can pretty much preview the terrain, without even letting the build finish, it's

130
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
just that these scars caused by the division between the components of the landscape

131
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
are very distracting. But you can see that this is looking, you know, reasonably feasible,

132
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
isn't it already? And the great thing is that once we are clamped to the ground, once we're a vehicle that can't leave

133
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
the ground, it's kind of a believable scenario right? We've got a

134
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
sun and a sky and some mountains that we can't pass, for some really weird reason. You do

135
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
kind of ask the question, well how on earth did anybody ever get to this place in the first place?

136
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It's a bit weird when there's no way out. So, there's other things

137
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
you could do there perhaps, like maybe make a gap in the mountains and a

138
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
blocked road or something or make a much bigger terrain

139
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
or series of terrains that we stitch together. But we're not doing any of that in this

140
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
section, we're going for city scale and focusing on vehicle control, etc.

141
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So, I just want to show you that once this lighting build is complete, you see all of those scars have gone,

142
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and it's looking much better now! So that's cool!

143
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Let's put you in the challenge! Your challenge is to create your own version 1 landscape. Remember

144
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
you'll iterate this later. Keep it simple.

145
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Make about a 500 by 500 meter flat area, in the middle for now. We want to

146
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
be able to drive this very simple tank around,

147
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
in an uninterrupted way at first, without worrying about our own interaction with the terrain. Then, we'll build up

148
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
the middle area later. So that's it! It'll also allow for ray casting,

149
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and we want to start ray casting in a flat area. We're going to do this for enemy detection and

150
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
things, and we want it just simple in the middle. So, keep it simple in the middle, make your own terrain. I'm obviously not going to

151
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
show you the solution, because there is no one solution, and when you finish, please please share

152
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
your photo of this with the other students, because it'd

153
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
be great to see what you guys come up with. Spend as long or as little time on it as you like and just

154
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
enjoy it, and I'll see you on the other side!

155
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.666
