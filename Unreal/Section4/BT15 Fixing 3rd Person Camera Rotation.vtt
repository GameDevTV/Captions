1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, let's

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
get to fixing the 3rd person camera rotation! What we're

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
going to do in this video is organize our blueprint a little bit differently in the tank

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with an Azimuth Gimbal, as we call it, and some slight changes in rotations

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
in the SpringArm, so that firstly the tank

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
camera works properly, and secondly, the horizon always stays

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.933
horizontal, or at least optionally always stays horizontal, even if the tank is tilted like this, because of say a hill.

8
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.933
So, let's take a closer look at what's going on with this rotation. We want to use

9
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.933
something called Gimbals. You probably want to search for that with text, not with

10
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.933
voice, just in case it goes wrong. But Gimbals will be somewhere on

11
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:46.933
trusty Wikipedia. Here you go! The features of a Gimbal is, it's a support that

12
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.933
"allows the rotation of an object about a single axis." So, we're going to be using a

13
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.933
couple of Gimbals. So, let's take a look at the

14
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.933
tank blueprint and see what we need to do to make the camera rotation

15
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.933
behave itself. Well, we have this SpringArm and we can visualize that

16
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:06.933
here in the viewport as basically an arm that sits

17
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.933
here, and it's actually got a red length to it and we've actually

18
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:14.933
currently got our camera in the wrong place. It's not at the

19
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:18.933
end of the SpringArm. So, let's fix that, choose your camera, and reset the location,

20
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.966
pushing it onto the end of the SpringArm. So, now you may say, well how do we

21
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:26.933
position our camera? Well, what you need to do is change the length of the Spring

22
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:30.933
Arm, so the SpringArm has a Target Arm Length here.

23
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:34.933
And we set that to say, I don't know, 1,000, you know 10 meters, something like

24
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:38.933
that and then we're in better shape. So, now the camera will stay on

25
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:42.933
the end of the SpringArm. I'm going to remove the camera's

26
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:46.933
Rotation for now, and of course, if we were to play now the camera would just be on the floor

27
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:50.933
behind the tank but we still have this strange rotational issue.

28
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.933
So, what we want to do is, we want a couple of Gimbals, one

29
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:58.933
which allows rotation of the camera in this

30
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:02.933
plane. Probably use this to just show you. Get the rotation tool up this way

31
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:06.933
in Azimuth. OK, so let's do that first! How do we do that? Well,

32
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:10.933
we can't do it all in one object without twisting the camera. Imagine

33
00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:14.933
this was plugged into a ball joint. If it's plugged into a ball joint, we can end up with the

34
00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:18.933
wrong type of rotation. You see how as I rotate the camera both in Azimuth and Elevation,

35
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:22.933
you see how it's ending up on the tilt like that? We don't want

36
00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:26.933
it on the tile right? So, what we want to do is put yourself

37
00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:30.933
a Scene root component, it's basically a simple

38
00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:34.933
transform, into the scene. Put

39
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:38.933
that on the Tank. If you accidentally put it at the root like I did, then just

40
00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:42.933
put the Tank back at the root, but the Scene root wants to be on the Tank.

41
00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:46.933
Then, put the SpringArm into the Scene root. Now, I'm going to rename these things, because it's not

42
00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:50.933
very helpful just calling it Scene. What this thing is, is it's an Azimuth

43
00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:54.933
Gimbal

44
00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:58.933
OK. So, this thing will allow this rotation Aximuth

45
00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:02.933
Gimbal. Great! Then, the SpringArm itself

46
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:06.933
is a SpringArm and it also provides for elevation.

47
00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:10.933
So, I think I'm going to just leave it called a SpringArm, but we are only going to

48
00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:14.933
control it in Elevation, so I'm going to move it up a little bit. The Azimuth

49
00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:18.933
Gimbal position, I'm going to actually put that, rather than at the middle of the tank, this is

50
00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:22.933
where the camera's pointing at. We want it pointing about 1 1/2 meters off the ground.

51
00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:26.933
So in summary, we have a Scene root component that says, this is

52
00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:30.933
where the camera's pointing at, if it points straight down the SpringArm, which it currently is,

53
00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:34.933
and the location of that is 1.5 meters

54
00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:38.933
off the ground in the middle of the tank. You then have a SpringArm about 10 meters

55
00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:42.933
long, rotated up like this, and on the end of that you have a camera, probably with no

56
00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:46.933
rotation. OK, let's take a look at how it works! It's pretty good! We've still got the

57
00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:50.933
weirdness. So, what do we do about the weirdness? The weirdness is because

58
00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:54.933
I said that the Azimuth Gimbal is only driving the Azimuth, and the SpringArm

59
00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:58.933
is going to be doing the Elevation only, like this. So, Elevation

60
00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:02.933
happens here like that. Azimuth happens here

61
00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:06.933
in the Azimuth Gimbal. OK, so what do we do? We go

62
00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:10.933
over to the Input Setup. We already have a reference to the SpringArm

63
00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:14.933
and let's have a look! Azimuth we said is being done by the

64
00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:18.933
Azimuth Gimbal. So, what we need to do is get rid of the SpringArm there, pop in a reference to the

65
00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:22.933
Azimuth Gimbal, by dragging from the components, and it's that

66
00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:26.933
that becomes the target of an Azimuth rotation. So, the Azimuth Gimbal

67
00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.933
handles the Azimuth rotation, and the AimElevation is

68
00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:34.933
handled by the SpringArm itself. Let's try this! This is about 90

69
00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:38.933
percent of the solution we're looking for! Left and right and up and down and it

70
00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:42.933
works exactly as we want, but let's see what happens if we put the

71
00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:46.933
camera or the tank on a piece of sloping ground. So I think, at this stage,

72
00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:50.933
I'm going to sculpt the terrain a little, so we need some test grounds here. So, I'm just going to

73
00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:54.933
pop into the Landscape, Molding Tool, and the Sculpt Tool.

74
00:04:54.933 --> 00:04:58.933
I'm just going to bring up some landscape here, that we can start

75
00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:02.933
to use. Remember that fragmentation of the components of the landscape is expected, before it rebuilds

76
00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:06.933
the lighting. And I've got a little bit of land here, so let's

77
00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:10.933
just try going to the tank, the Player Start rather.

78
00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:14.933


79
00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:18.933
Then, you need to come out of Landscape Sculpting Mode, at which point

80
00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:22.933
you'll be able to move the Player Start, and I'm just going to move this Player Start above the hill

81
00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:26.933
and let the tank fall onto the slope. Let's try it!

82
00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:30.933
You see, as the tank rotated on the slope,

83
00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:34.933
you see that our whole camera has rotated. That's OK, that's a choice as to

84
00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:38.933
whether we want the horizon to rotate. If we don't want the horizon to

85
00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:42.933
rotate, then the way that we deal with that is, in the Spring Arm itself,

86
00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:46.900
you can say don't Inherit the Roll of the thing you're connected to.

87
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.933
So, in the SpringArm's Camera Settings, you can disable Inherit Roll,

88
00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:54.933
and then, what'll happen when we fall and twist is that the

89
00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:58.933
horizon stays horizontal and then the tank itself appears to twist in our

90
00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:02.933
view. So, this is the camera being like gyro stabilized in roll.

91
00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:06.933
I hope that all makes sense to you. So, that's how I'm going to leave things. I may as well

92
00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:10.933
spawn on this hillside. Why not for a bit of fun? I'm just going to recap

93
00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:14.933
exactly what's happened here for you, so that it's clear how to do these more

94
00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:18.933
complicated 3rd person cameras. So, because we need control

95
00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:22.933
of the Azimuth and the Elevation, we've decided to put a object at the

96
00:06:22.933 --> 00:06:26.933
target of the camera, and we're calling it an Azimuth Gimbal. So, that is like

97
00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:30.933
a... It's a bit like the turret actually.

98
00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:34.933
It's the same type of rotation that we get wth the turret itself. It's just a

99
00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:38.933
horizontal rotation, so that would be like a kind of peg sticking up if

100
00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:42.933
you like. Onto the peg is attached a SpringArm, which we can,

101
00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:46.933
because of a hinge or another Gimbal, we can choose different heights, and we're only

102
00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:50.933
controlling the Elevation with that. So, if you look at the Input Setup, you can

103
00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:54.933
see that Azimuth, Elevation.

104
00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:58.933
And then, what we're doing is, we're pointing the camera straight down the SpringArm, we don't have to but we're doing

105
00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:02.933
that, and because, when the tank rotates

106
00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:06.933
the whole system rotates, i.e. the tank

107
00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:10.933
and the SpringArm and the camera rotate, when the tank's on the side. Of course, the view of

108
00:07:10.933 --> 00:07:14.933
the horizon becomes tilted, because the camera and the tank

109
00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:18.933
are tilted, relative to the horizon. So, the final thing we did is, we went to the SpringArm

110
00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:22.933
and said, well don't let the camera on the end of the SpringArm Inherit the

111
00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:26.933
Roll of the SpringArm, and hence the tank and hence the SpringArm.

112
00:07:26.933 --> 00:07:30.933
Alright, so we finally end up in the situation where we have the camera

113
00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:34.933
how we want it. Pretty cool! So, that's it

114
00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:38.933
for this video! And I haven't got a challenge for you in this one, because it's really

115
00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:42.933
just a question of following me through, but what I would say if you haven't been doing what I've been

116
00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:46.933
doing as you go is, just get this setup to your satisfaction. You don't have us the exact

117
00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:50.933
settings I'm using right? You could have the camera a little bit farther away,

118
00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:54.933
you could decide that actually you want to Inherit the Roll and that you quite like

119
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:58.933
this camera going with the tank. It's up to you.

120
00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:02.933
Alright, it's not going to affect the game play at all! So, just set the camera up how you want it now,

121
00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:06.133
and I'll see you in the next video!
