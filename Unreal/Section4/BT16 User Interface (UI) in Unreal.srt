00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this video

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we're going to take another major step towards being able to make a real game. which is you're going to start to

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
touch the User Interface System in Unreal which will be great!

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What we're going to do with that is very simple actually... I don't know if you can see it even. but there's a

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
little tiny white dot. about a 1/3 of the way down the screen and in the middle; it's kind of

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
over the enemy tank right now. that's our aiming reticle. So. we're going to make

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a Player UI Widget and a Tank Player Controller that's going to spawn that widget.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and then. the magic will happen! So. let's see how it's done!

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.800


10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.800
So. what we want to create is a little dot

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.800
in the screen. about a 1/3 of the way down the screen and right in the middle.

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.800
So. about where the enemy tank is in our Viewport now. something like that.

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.800
and that becomes our aim point. The simplest way to do that is to

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.800
use User Interface. something called a Widget Blueprint. and we're going

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.800
to be needing that anyway to display our ammo and to create our Start Menu later. So. let's get

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.800
into Widget Blueprints and User Interface! Just before I do. I'm going

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.800
to delete my high poly model of the ground. You could proceed with high

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.800
poly modeling. it's just taking a lot more time and the focus of this section is more on

19
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.800
control systems. So. I'm going to delete that high poly landscape. and

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.800
I'm also just going to move the FlatLand material into the BattleGround sharedassets. just to tidy up.

21
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.800
It's as simple as that. Finally. I have a _Levels folder here. but I haven't

22
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.800
used it. underscore Levels. Why underscore? Simply because it floats to the top.

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800
It's quite common that we want to choose our level. Later. we'll want to have a start scene in here. too.

24
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.800
And if you underscore levels. it floats to the top of the list. as simple as that. Alright.

25
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.800
so how are we going to do this? Well. we want to make ourselves

26
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.800
our first Widget Blueprint. So. in the Content tab you go to Add New. look for Widget.

27
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.800
or just scroll down for it. and User Interface.

28
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Widget Blueprint. That's what we want! Talk about Slate. that's a more advanced

29
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.800
tool for User Interface. We're just going to be

30
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.800
messing around with the Widget Blueprint for now. Alright. let's call it

31
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.800
Player

32
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.800
UI. for example. OK. because it's going to be the player's User Interface that we're designing

33
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.800
here. Fantastic! So. let's go into the Widget Blueprint. A whole new

34
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.800
load of tools for you! Unreal's great like this. it's got so many tools hiding away!

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.800
So. I'm just going to get rid of the Animation Timeline. at the bottom. and the Animations tab. we

36
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.800
simply don't need those and just keep things nice and simple.

37
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.800
OK. so for the sake of what we're doing here. we actually just need an

38
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.800
image. That's all we need. just a very simple couple of white

39
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.800
pixels. to be honest. So. what we're going to do is just add an image.

40
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.800
drop it in the scene. Now. the first thing we need to get right is the anchoring.

41
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.800
We want to make sure it's always anchored to a position that is

42
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.800
1/2 way along the screen and exactly a 1/3 of the way down the screen.

43
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.800
And the way we're doing things at the moment. if you just drop the image in. the anchor

44
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800
point is at the top-left. Let's see what happens if you change screen size. You see

45
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.800
how it's anchored a fixed number of pixels away from the top left? That's no use

46
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.800
to us. So. the first thing we want to do is change this anchor point. Now. the

47
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800
simplest way to make sure that this image is always at 50% of the way

48
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.800
across horizontally and a 1/3 of the way down vertically is just

49
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.800
literally to drag the anchor point there. There you go! So. add 50% horizontally.

50
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.800
33.3%. exactly 1/3. vertically. So then.

51
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.800
this is where it's going to stay anchored to. Look what happens now. if we change the screen size. That option

52
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.800
is at the top-right. You see how it's always a

53
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.800
1/3 of the way down the screen and 1/2 way

54
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.800
across the screen OK. So. I'm just going to go 19" monitor. It

55
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.800
doesn't really matter. we're going to be focusing on a 16:9 ratio. I just wanted to show you that. that's going to

56
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.800
stay there regardless. OK. so next question. Where

57
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800
is this block compared to that pivot point? Well. that's

58
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.800
these positions on the right-hand side. or not necessarily. it depends where you've got your Details

59
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.800
tab. But in your Details tab. under the Slot section. you can see Position.

60
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800
and if you reset these positions in X and Y

61
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800
and also the Size. I think maybe 5 pixels will be enough in X and Y.

62
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.800
Then. we've got a 5 by 5 pixel blop. but it's not

63
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.800
quite sitting in the middle of the anchor point. and the reason for that is the alignment needs to be

64
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.800
0.5 0.5. OK. you can see

65
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.800
that if the Alignment was 0 0. then it's the top-left of

66
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.800
the image that sits on the anchor point. but we want 0.5. which means half way across

67
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.800
horizontally and halfway up vertically. that's where we want it!

68
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.800
So. if we zoom all the way out now. what we've got is a little dot that regardless of

69
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.800
the screen size and shape is going to be a 1/3 of the way down

70
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.800
and 1/2 way across. Cool. nice and simple! So.

71
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.800
I'm just going to call this image something different. Let's call it Aim

72
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.800
Point. like that. and compile

73
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.800
the Player UI Widget and that is the start. We have a

74
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.833
Player UI Widget. Now. don't be disappointed that when you play your game it doesn't show.

75
00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:56.800
that's because we haven't yet setup the blueprint to make that show. which is

76
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800
what we need to do next. So. it's at this point we want to think about what

77
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.800
entity is responsible for showing the Player UI. Well. you could say it's

78
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800
the tank. because it's always there when we're possessing the tank. but how about if we

79
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800
de-possess the tank. i.e. our tank gets blown up. for example. What would

80
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.800
happen if we weren't actually possessing the tank? Should we still be showing our

81
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.800
UI? I think we should. Fundamentally. it's the Player Controller

82
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.800
that is responsible for showing the Player UI. or that's the choice we're making

83
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.800
in this section. And we don't have a Player Controller yet. so let's go ahead and make ourselves a new blueprint class.

84
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.800
So. as we're making a Player Controller. the type of the blueprint we're going to use is a

85
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.800
Player Controller. It's an Actor responsible for controlling a

86
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.800
Pawn used by the Player. That Pawn is the tank and we are the Player.

87
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.800
So. there you go. let's make that new blueprint! Let's call it Player

88
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.800
Controller or TankPlayer?

89
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.800
Controller I think. dot underscore BP.

90
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.800
Why TankPlayerController? Because we are possibly going to have Tank

91
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.800
AIController later. when we get to the point of having AI tanks.

92
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.800
Great! So. in the TankPlayerController. that is where we're going

93
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.800
to setup the User Interface. So. I'm going to show you how to do that. and then. I'm going to

94
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.800
allow you. as a challenge. to do the last little bit. So. if we go to the Event

95
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.800
Graph of your newly formed Tank Player Controller blueprint.

96
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.800
I'm going to delete the tick for the moment; it's the BeginPlay that we're interested in.

97
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.800
OK. so there's the BeginPlay node. So drag an execution pin

98
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.800
from your BeginPlay to get things going and search

99
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.800
for widget. One of the things we can do is under the User Interface section. which makes sense.

100
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.800
we create a widget. So. let's do that! Let's ditch this tab at the bottom.

101
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.800
So. we are going to create a widget. Now. what's the widget class? We've made it.

102
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.800
it's the Player UI class. We don't need

103
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.800
to worry about an owning player. for the moment. That's going to default

104
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.800
to us because we're going to be the Tank Player Controller. What we do

105
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.800
need to do. once we've created the widget. is we then need to add it to the Viewport. So. if

106
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.800
you drag off the execution node.

107
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.800
search for Add to Viewport. then that's what we're trying to do.

108
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.800
Now. it needs to know what to add to the Viewport. and that will be a reference

109
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.800
to the widget we just created. OK. so let

110
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.800
me just explain that a little bit more. The Player UI that we're working in here is.

111
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.800
if you look at it and you hover over it. it is a (Widget Blueprint). It is a blueprint

112
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.800
for making a UI Widget. What we're doing in the

113
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.800
Player Controller is saying. OK go ahead and create an instance of a UI Widget

114
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.800
from that template. which we've specified here. and once you've

115
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.800
got a reference to it. use that to add that widget to

116
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.800
the Viewport. OK. so we're nearly there! We're nearly there! If you compile

117
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.800
that blueprint in play. you're going to find. unfortunately. that little dot still doesn't show

118
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.800
up because there's one final thing we need to do. and I'm going to give you the satisfaction

119
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.800
of doing it. So. I want you to set the Player Controller. Find the game mode blueprint

120
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.800
for this level. We've already visited that in this section.

121
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.800
Set the Player Controller to be our new blueprint class. and then. test that the

122
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.800
aiming dot indeed shows up now. So go ahead. pause the video. and do that

123
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.800
last bit yourself.

124
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.800
OK. welcome

125
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.800
back! So. this is relatively simple. one option is the Blueprints menu. As long as we're in

126
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.800
this level. we'll see Edit BattleTankGameMode_BP.

127
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.800
We go into that and then. under here where it says Player Controller

128
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.800
Class we choose the TankPlayerController_BP. compile the class.

129
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.800
and play the game. And you see the little white dot in about the right place?

130
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.800
Pretty cool! There you go! So. now we have an aiming UI

131
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.800
widget. and we have used User Interface in Unreal. which will set us up for creating

132
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.800
Start Menus and all sorts of other fun! So. see you soon!

133
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.566
