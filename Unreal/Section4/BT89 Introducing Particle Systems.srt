
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So welcome to Introducing Particles

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Systems! In this video we are actually going to get as far as this,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is that we can get our tank, we can fire, and look it leaves

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,500
smoke and everything. How cool is that! See you in there!

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,500
OK guys, so we want to make a particle system. Now that we don't have

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,500
the starter content imported, let me show you a neat trick for getting

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
starter content across, without bringing all of it across. So go

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
ahead into the EPIC Games Launcher or just to

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
your BattleGround project and make a

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,500
new project. We're going to make a whole new Blank Unreal project With Starter Content.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I'm just going to call the project StarterContent,

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
and the idea is that once we have an empty StarterContent

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
project, which you can see forming itself here in the Editor... By the way, with the Settings

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I used it doesn't need to be a C++ project, it just needs to be Blank project With Starter Content,

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
that's all it needs to be. Now, when it opens, if you've got a VR device, it's

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
going to start trying to open all your VR devices, which is going to be a hassle.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
So just go to your Plugins, turn off all or any plugins that relate to

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
VR, that are causing those things to start when you start the project

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
and just restart it. Then, you can close your Oculus and

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
your vive and whatever else your lucky enough to have. I have to have those for work, of course.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Aren't I hard cut done by? So here we go, we have a Starter Content

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,500
project. Now what we can do in here is, we can go around, son't change anything in here

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
because that is just a bit of a, you know... ?Well to be honest

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
you could enforce that you can't change anything in here, by making

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
this particular Starter Content folder read only. Let's go ahead and

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
do that, actually. So if you go as far as there, we can go and find

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
in Explorer the Starter Content folder, maybe go up one.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,500
What I'm going to do is right-click it, go to Properties, and just make all of

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
it Read Only, turn it into a tick, including the sub-folders.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
And now, what that means is that if I'm in the Starter Content project, absent mindedly, and I

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
go and try and change something like this Explosion, some parameter on here, it doesn't matter

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
what these things are at the moment, then it won't let me save it. If you get this box

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
it's because it won't let you save, because the file is not writable

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
OK, and you can't even make it writable because it's made

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
non-writable by the operating system. OK but what we can do in this

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
project is browse things, and go, OK well maybe this is good for the muzzle flash, it's

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
a good starting point for the muzzle flash. So let's

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,500
move this into our project! So let's see how to do that! You right-click it,

39
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Asset Actions, and Migrate. So in your Starter

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Conent project, if you made one, if you haven't take a breath for a moment to go off and

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
make yourself a Starter Content project, it's a useful tool to have. Then,

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
go find the particle system you want, which we're going to be using P_Explosion, right-

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,500
click it, Asset Actions, Migrate. Then, it'll say well

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
do you want to save what you change? Well no, because we don't want to save what we change, we want the one from

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
the starter pack. It then tells you all the stuff that it's going to bring with it, all these textures and

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,500
materials. You just say OK. Then, the first time it's a little laborious,

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
because you have to drill through and find where you want to put it. So in my case, it's Documents,

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
repos, Unreal, BattleTank, BattleTank,

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
and it's the Content folder you want to point it to, of your project OK,

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
it's important! Once you've found that project and you say OK, it does a very quick migration.

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Then, close the StarterContent folder, you don't need to save anything.

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
The whole project even, close the whole project. It didn't matter whether you have your Battle Tank project

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
open or not, at that time, it will work, but don't have two Unreal projects open at the same

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
time, because you'll probably find yourself doing things in one project, when you're meant to be doing

55
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
them in another. OK. So now, look what we've got over here! We

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
have StarterContent back! Why? Haven't I gone around in circles? Well I have

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
and if we look at source control it should have picked up the fact that we've added StarterContent but there's

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,500
not much, there's only a little handful of things in here now, OK,

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
and that's the key, is that we've only got what we need for this P_Explosion

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
particle effect. Now in terms of how you want to organize your assets,

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
you could move the Explosion into the Projectile, if you want to.

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm even going to rename it, I'm just going to hit F2 to rename that, and I'm

63
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
going to call it whatever we called it in the code, actually. I think we called it Launch

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Blast? Yeah, I won't look it up, I'm pretty sure it was LaunchBlast.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,500


66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
LaunchBlast, there you go! So now I have a particle effect, in Projectile,

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
called LaunchBlast, and it's dependencies are sitting in the StarterContent folder.

68
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Now it's entirely up to you if you want to move these textures and materials into the

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Projectile, to have all of the Projectile assets together. There are so many of them, I'm not going to

70
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
bother. I'm going to allow myself to have a thin, very minimal, source

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,500
control tracked StarterContent folder now OK, because that's

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,500
how things end up by default, and if we import other assets they might want to reference these

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
as well. But I will move the actual MuzzleBlast into the Projectile, just to say to me, well

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,500
these are the things that constitute the Projectile. If I want to see the dependencies of

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
the MuzzleBlast, I can always go to the Reference Viewer and see what else it needs. Cool!

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
So let's finally get in and actually modify

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
this and look at and understand this particle effect! You want to make sure that you can

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,500
change things, that you can click Save in here, in the beginning, and that it hasn't brought over any read only

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,500
properties. It hasn't! Now I'm going to talk you through the overview of

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
how this particle system thing works! So you have a Viewport, if you don't have any other windows,

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I mentioned, just click the Window menu and bring them up. That is showing you a

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
simulation of how this particle effect is going to look. If you don't like the background color, you

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
click in the Viewport, in the toolbar click Background Color, and then, maybe

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
turn it into something like a light sky, because that's what we're go?ing to be seeing it against, mainly.

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
There you go, so I've changed the background color! The rest of this stuff in this toolbar,

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
well we're not going to use that often, possibly Restart Sim just to go back to the beginning of the

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Simulation, in a longer simulation a longer effect, but otherwise, I'm not going to be using

88
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,500
that toolbar much. Let's hide the tab. Viewport, what else can we do in

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Viewport? Well a whole bunch of stuff on the left, under View, we're not going to use at the moment, but time

90
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,500
can be handy. You can slow this thing down to 10%, click Restart, and then, you

91
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
can really carefully look at say the beginning of the simulation. So that's what you

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
can do under Time. I'm going to leave mine at 100%. Then, let's move right. We have

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Emitters. Now what's Emitters all about? Well this effect is built up from

94
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,500
a whole bunch of things. You can turn them on and off with the ticks, so if you just

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,500
wanted to turn off say the Shockwave, then you'd turn that off

96
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
and then you get the same effect without the Shockwave. If you want to look at the Shockwave only,

97
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,500
you hit S for Solo, and it turns everything else off, apart from the Shockwave.

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,500
You can also add the fireball. You can have Solo, S for single, but you can

99
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,500
have many singles. So why would you have both the ability to have many singles and

100
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,500
checkboxes? Well imagine you had 30 emitters and you wanted to see only 2 of them,

101
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,500
you would do that just by going click click, and you don't have to un-tick 28 things off to the

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,500
right. Imagine, on the other hand, you wanted to see 29 of the

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,500
30, of course, the way to do that would just be to unselect the one you don't want. So that gives you quite

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
a lot of flexibility. So the other thing we have here in the middle is a button, which changes the

105
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,500
render mode, the Emitter Render Mode, for how it displays for

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,500
debugging. But let's not worry about that one for now, we leave that on what looks like some 10 pin bowling, although it looks less

107
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
than 10, it's 6 pin bowling [Laughs], and if you click it you can see down here in details

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
what the render mode is. But let's not worry about that for now, we just don't need it.

109
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,500
So Details, what does that tell you? Well it depends on what you're selected on. Each Emitter will

110
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
have a different set of details. When you click in the actual top of it it'll go orange,

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
and if you click down into these, what we call modules like Required, Spawn,

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Lifetime, Initial Size, each of those will have a bunch of properties, as well.

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,500
They all have a Required, that tells you what material it's using if any. For example,

114
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Smoke is created by using a material that is

115
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,500
spawned into the world many times and it's a transparent material, and it tells you

116
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
where it's being emitted from and how it's aligned to this camera

117
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
or not. Basically, these things generally are pointing straight to the camera, they're little pieces of

118
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,500
transparent cellophane or cardboard, if you like, in real terms. They're just

119
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,500
tranSparent textures that are rendered facing the camera and they give these effects.

120
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
You can also choose whether this stuff happens in local or global space, that will become important

121
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
in a moment. All of these effects I think, I haven't looked through them all, are in

122
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,500
local space, as you click through the Required

123
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
section. The Sparks aren't actually, so the Sparks are staying in the world. As you click on this Required

124
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,500
module, everything but the Sparks and the Shockwave

125
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
are in local space, so they'll go with the projectile. Let's

126
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,500
see that! If we watch carefully as we fire it... Ah, well

127
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
actually [Laughs] we're missing a trick here, you need to go to your Projectile blueprint.

128
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
You need to make the Full Blueprint Editor on your LaunchBlast.

129
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Of course, we need to choose the particle system under the Details tab, under the

130
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Particles, Template, which is the LaunchBlast. Compile that!

131
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Now let's take a look at the particle system. F11 for full screen,

132
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
and then, let's take a look at it coming out. OK, so you can actually just

133
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,500
see, if you're sharp, that the particles, the sparks,

134
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
stay where they are in the world and everything else like

135
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,500
the smoke goes along with the actual

136
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,500
cannon ball or with the projectile, OK. So that's the difference between world

137
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,500
space and local space. There's smoke coming out of the projectile in the world. Look we could fire it,

138
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,500
hit F8, and then... Probably easier with our thing up.

139
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Let's just fire once more. Possess, fire, F8, Pause.

140
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Now we could go to that projectile in the world space.

141
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
But what we want to happen in the projectile is, we want it to be leaving smoke

142
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
behind it, so how are we going to do that? Well the final thing we need to

143
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
look at is this Curve Editor. I want you to remove all curves, that won't change the

144
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,500
behavior of the particle effect, try it! Right-click inside one of these curves,

145
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
down here, Remove All Curves, and it just means it's plotting nothing but the

146
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
particle effect has been unaffected by that. So this Smoke

147
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Emitter here has a Lifetime property or module

148
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,500
on it. You can add new modules by right-clicking up here and then

149
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,500
adding these modules. There's tons of an amazing amount of stuff you can with particle systems!

150
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,500
If you click the little Plot icon, next to Lifetime, it will plot it down here.

151
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
You can click Fit to fit it to the graph, and you can use the mouse wheel to

152
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,500
go in and out. What's this red and green dot. Well firstly, you can turn that

153
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,500
lifetime plot on and off. You may have several different factors that you've added with a little yellow

154
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,500
dot here, and then, the green and red correspond to something. In this

155
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,500
case, what do they correspond to? Well look in the Details tab. We have a

156
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Uniform Distribution, which means that this smoke will last somewhere

157
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,500
between 2 and 3 seconds. You can change that by dragging

158
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
the 3 up or dragging this up here to say 9 seconds.

159
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
And now what that means, if we watch this carefully, is that the smoke part of

160
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
this will now last somewhere between 3 and 9 seconds, different

161
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,500
every time OK. Or 2 and 9 seconds rather. I'm going to reset

162
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,500
that to 2 to 3, but that gives some variability. So the general

163
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,500
deal with particle systems, have a look on Wikipedia, "wiki particle

164
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
systems". Just have a look at that, it gives you a pretty good

165
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
overview of what they're like. It talks about the fuzzy phenomenon and the spawning

166
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,500
of things and the fact that you normally are using a

167
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
variable amount of time that things last for, etc.

168
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,733
Have a look at that, I'll put that in the resources of this lecture for you OK.

169
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:14,733
So what we're going to do to leave a smoke trail is, I'm going to start

170
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:18,733
with the same smoke. So right-click on your Smoke and Duplicate the Emitter.

171
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:22,733
Now you've got two called Smoke, so let's right-click. I'm going to choose the right-hand one.

172
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:26,733
They're the same so it doesn't matter. Rename it to Smoke Trail.

173
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:30,733
So now we've got a Smoke Trail to work on. Now the thing that's going to make

174
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:34,733
it different, firstly, is click the Required module of the Smoke Trail,

175
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:38,733
go into the Details tab, and then, go to where it talks about Using

176
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:42,733
Local Space. No, let's go World Space! So let's see the effect of that. We've

177
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:46,733
turned off Local Space on the Smoke Trail. Play the game, we fire.

178
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:50,733
What do we get? Well we get smoke that's staying attached to the projectile, but we also get

179
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:54,733
smoke that stays just outside the barrel but we only get one lump of smoke. What

180
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:58,733
we want is for that projectile to be continuously emitting smoke.

181
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:02,733
So how do you do that? Well you go to the Spawn module there.

182
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:06,733
Under Spawn you go and look, and we're going to make a Constant Spawn

183
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:10,733
Rate, and we're going to have it or we could have a range if you want it, it doesn't really matter. I'm going to

184
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:14,733
go with Constant and let's just try spawning at say 30,

185
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,733
30 per second OK. so put a Spawn Rate against the Smoke

186
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:22,733
Trail emitter of 30 per second. Save that, maximize

187
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:26,733
your screen, fire. Ah look at that, that's looking better! It's

188
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:30,733
lifetime's too short, because the smoke is, I would say, running out too early, so I'm just

189
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:34,733
going to fix that, and then, I'm going to challenge you to go ahead and make things how you want them. So click

190
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,733
on Lifetime. We've got somewhere between 2 and 3 seconds, let's just make it a constant

191
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:42,733
30 seconds. Then, in code, we can disable this once

192
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:46,733
it hits something. So I've made the Lifetime 30 seconds.

193
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:50,733
Let's have a look! Ah, it looks pretty

194
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:54,733
cool, apart from the color has gone a bit funny now.

195
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,733
So that's probably because we have a Color Over Lifetime.

196
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:02,733
If you have a look here, we have Color Over Lifetime,

197
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:06,733
and you can plot that by clicking the little graph. It will bring the curves down here. If you've got curves you

198
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:10,733
don't want, Remove All Curves. Never any harm in doing that, it doesn't change the properties a

199
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:14,733
bit. And if you click Color Over Lifetime, which is the one we're interested in, you can turn off Alpha

200
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:18,733
Over Lifetime with that yellow dot. And if we just plot Color Over Lifetime, you

201
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:22,733
can see the red, green, and blue. How do I know that's what it is? Well just

202
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:26,733
from experience but you could also come in here and look, and if you drill down

203
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:30,733
far enough, eventually you will see what these things

204
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:34,733
actually mean, In Values, Out Values, etc. And

205
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:38,733
you can see what effect this Color Over Lifetime is going to have. I want

206
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:42,733
it to, if anything, not change very much over its life, so I'm just going to reduce that

207
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:46,733
change. Oh, OK

208
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:50,733
so I think what we've got here is we've got... I don't even need, I don't think, Color Over Lifetime.

209
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,733
Let's just turn it off, you can temporarily turn it off there.

210
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:58,733
That's fine! But now it doesn't have a color, so we need

211
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,733
to maybe make it a constant Color Over Lifetime.

212
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:06,733
So simplify the Color Over Lifetime massively,

213
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:10,733
make it just a constant black. Let's try that!

214
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:14,733
That's better but it's taking a while to

215
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:18,733
grow, it's growing too slowly. So that's the size over

216
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:22,733
lifetime. So if I Remove All the Curves, Plot size over lifetime,

217
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,733
have a look at that, I could fit it, and the problem I'm finding is that it's not

218
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:30,733
growing fast enough, so I just drag that to the left. And hopefully

219
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:34,733
you get the idea. Let's have a look! So it's black constant...

220
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:38,733
[Strange Cannon Noise] No something's still... Ah, you know what it probably is, it's probably Transparency

221
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:42,733
Over Lifetime! So if we Plot Color Over Life, one of the things we'll

222
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:46,733
end up with, if we turn the others off, is Alpha Over Life. Let's plot that! And indeed,

223
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:50,733
Alpha Over Life is taking a while to go up,

224
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:54,733
and actually, we don't even want it changing like that. We probably just want a Constant

225
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:58,733
Alpha Over Life. And let's just try fully opaque, see

226
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:02,733
how that looks. That looks better to me! OK

227
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:06,733
there's a thousand handles you can pull here, but to be honest, that's good enough.

228
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:10,733
It's fine that the thing stopped smoking. What I want you to do now is, I want you to go ahead

229
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:14,733
and setup and share your smoke. Tweak the parameters to your taste.

230
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:18,733
Get creative with the color, the size etc. Don't worry about it disappearing from the

231
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:22,733
side view, let me just show you that. If we look at the smoke

232
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:26,733
trail, from a sufficiently wide camera view, it will just disappear. You see how it

233
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,733
disappears there, we'll sort that out in the next lecture. That is a known problem, don't try and

234
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:34,733
fix or fix it if you want, but I'm going to tell you, in the next lecture, how to fix it.

235
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,733
And then, share with the community, there's a link in the resources to our community site,

236
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:42,733
your smoke effect. I'd love to see it! Get a bit creative with color size, etc., and have

237
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,733
fun! Nothing else to do in this video, so the video will end now. And I'll see you in the

238
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:50,733
next one, where we'll sort out the camera issue! But please, make your smoke cool, then share it with

239
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:54,266
the community!
