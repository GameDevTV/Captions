1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So hey. welcome back

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and welcome to Refactoring our Aiming Component. What we're going to do in this video is. we're going

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to change the architecture of the AimingComponent to use a single initialize method like

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
this. just like the Movement Component did. and then. to strip a whole load of code

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
out of the tank and start moving the functionality over to the AimingComponent. And yeah.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we're going to hit a brick wall in it. but I want you to hit that brick wall yourself.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Or you may not. you may do things slightly better than I have. but I want you to try and do this

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
reorganization. So look back at the video where we setup the Tank

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
MovementComponent. and see if you can get the TankAimingComponent to the

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
same sort of architecture. where it is actually added here in

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the Blueprint Editor and not added as

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a default sub-object. So refactor the AimingComponent. try and move the Aiming

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Component to the same architecture. as I said. Don't worry if you can't get it working. but see if

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you can get it at least as far as compiling. If you find your game hard crashes when you play

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or something. don't worry too much. but just see if you can get compiling and connected up in

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Blueprint. like I've got there. And that's going to be a great exercise for you! If you

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
struggle with this. don't worry. it's a pretty open-ended exercise. You're very welcome to stop and

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
just follow my solution. You don't need to feel bad about it. I'm setting a pretty nebulous challenge

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to allow for lots of different ranges of abilities to get their teeth stuck into this.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
OK so go ahead. pause the video. have a go at that. and when I come back. I will be going through

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and doing the refactor myself with you.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.166


23
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:28.166
So just before we dive in and start refactoring. let's just give ourselves a little bit of context.

24
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:32.166
Remember that the Movement Component is nicely separated with the Left and Right

25
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:36.166
Tracks. only bound to that component. but the Aiming Component still has this messy

26
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:40.166
loop. where the Tank has reference to the Barrel and they have these setters

27
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:44.166
being passed down. etc. So what we're going to do is move the Aiming Component into the same

28
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:48.166
paradigm as the Movement Component. that is added in Blueprint using an Initialize()

29
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:52.166
method. etc. So I'm going to go through this with you and do some refactoring. You're welcome to try and do

30
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:56.166
the refactor yourself. You know the experienced among you can certainly do that. just

31
00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:00.166
bring the Aiming Component into the same pattern as the Movement Component. And then. I'm going to lead us to

32
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:04.166
the point at which we have a horrible hard crash. which will be with no particularly obvious

33
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:08.166
source. and then. we're going to use the debugger. the VisualStudio debugger

34
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:12.166
to actually fix that up. So let's just start this refactor process.

35
00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:16.166
Let's have the tank blueprint open. so we can remind ourselves that one of the things we are

36
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:20.166
trying to get rid of is this Set Turret and Set Barrel Reference.

37
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:24.166
In fact. let's be brave and just delete them. we don't need those anymore. We're going to have an Initialize()

38
00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:28.166
method on our TankAimingComponent. of course. So let's go

39
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:32.166
break some stuff! Over in the tank header file. let's start off!

40
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:36.166
I think I'm actually going to start at the top and just fix up my copyright notice. as I

41
00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:40.166
did in the TankMovementComponent. So let's just do the Copyright notice for the tank header

42
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:44.166
file and the TankAimingComponent header file.

43
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:48.166
They're the two things we're going to be working on. It kind of signals to me. I've touched this thing recently.

44
00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:52.166
Sure if I had of set it in the Project Settings in the beginning then it'd be set. but whenever

45
00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:56.166
you notice a problem like this. let's fix it as we go. So in the tank header file we have this

46
00:02:56.166 --> 00:03:00.166
SetTurret and SetBarrel reference. Don't need them. let's get rid of them! Both the SetTurret and SetBarrel

47
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:04.166
References. Let's remove those and let's remove the code that actually does that setting.

48
00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:08.166
So that's great! We can also get rid of. in the ATank

49
00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:12.166
BeginPlay(). you'll notice we're not using it. so let's just ditch it. And let's ditch it from the

50
00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:16.166
header file as well. if it's in there. You can always put it back. it's really easy to put back again

51
00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:20.166
OK. And SetupPlayerInputComponent. we're not using that either. so I'm taking Setup

52
00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:24.166
PlayerInputComponent out of the Tank as well. as we're trying to clear

53
00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:28.166
up the Tank. Let's clear it up properly! OK. now over in the Tank.

54
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:32.166
the other thing that we're doing is creating a default sub-object of a TankAimingComponent.

55
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:36.166
Remember what that does? It makes this TankAimingComponent inherited here. which we don't have

56
00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:40.166
any details for. and it's different to the TankMovementComponent. so we're going to stop doing

57
00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:44.166
that! Let's delete the TankAimingComponent DefaultSubobjectCreation there.

58
00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:48.166
and then. let's

59
00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:52.166
recompile. I think it'll recompile at this stage.

60
00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:56.166
Now. I did a lot of code in a very short amount of time there. so what I'll do is I'll do you the favor.

61
00:03:56.166 --> 00:04:00.166
Now that hitting Compile has saved all the tabs in VisualStudio. I can  come

62
00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:04.166
into SourceTree. while it compiles. and I can show you what I've done. I've deleted a load of code from the

63
00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:08.166
Tank.cpp. all of this stuff that you can see on the screen there. I'll leave it for you for a second.

64
00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:12.166
And then. you can see what I've done in the header file.

65
00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:16.166
removed the relevant references that's all. and then. in the AimingComponent I've just

66
00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:20.166
changed my Copyright notice. OK. so there are the changes. Now the hot reload worked.

67
00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:24.166
Now lets go look at the tank blueprint! We no longer have this inherited TankAimingComponent.

68
00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:28.166
Fantastic! So let's add it back! Now. will it be visible? Well it will be visible in the

69
00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:32.166
Custom section. if we made it the correct type of U...

70
00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:36.166
Well let's go and have a look! Remember in the TankMovementComponent header file.

71
00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:40.166
we annotated as a (BlueprintSpawnableComponent).

72
00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:44.166
Well let's go and have a look in the TankAimingComponent header

73
00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:48.166
file. and it is already a (BlueprintSpawnableComponent). If

74
00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:52.166
yours isn't. of course. you need this annotation on the TankAimingComponent. Great! So

75
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:56.166
because it's BlueprintSpawnable I can come in here and I can add it as a

76
00:04:56.166 --> 00:05:00.166
TankAimingComponent. Great! There it is looking just like the TankMovementComponent. and we can

77
00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:04.166
actually see the properties on it now. That's fun! Now what we need is one of these Initialize()

78
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:08.166
methods for the TankMovementComponent. So I'm going to go... Ah sorry. not for

79
00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:12.166
the TankAimingComponent. I'm going to go look at the TankMovementComponent's Initialize() method. and

80
00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:16.166
I think I won't copy it because it's so different but I just want to remind

81
00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:20.166
myself how that works. I'm using the English spelling of Initialise and I'm just

82
00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:24.166
setting some references. So on the TankAimingComponent. we have

83
00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:28.166
these pointers to the Barrel and Turret. which is great! We don't need them on the tank anymore.

84
00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:32.166
by the way. So if you look at the tank. we don't need a Barrel reference anymore. Let's delete that from the

85
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:36.166
Tank. that's no longer necessary. And then. in the Tank

86
00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:40.166
AimingComponent we're going to need a new Initialize() method. Now it's going to need to be public.

87
00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:44.166
isn't it? And it's also going to need to have the same signature as it does in the MovementComponent. so

88
00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:48.166
I will use the MovementComponent for that. Here (BlueprintCallable. Category

89
00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:52.166
= "Setup") and then it's this Initialize. So let's just use that as inspiration.

90
00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:56.166
And then. be very careful to immediately change it from a UTank

91
00:05:56.166 --> 00:06:00.166
Track pointer to a UTank

92
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:04.166
Barrel pointer and a UTank

93
00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:08.166
Turret pointer. And then. it's

94
00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:12.166
going to be BarrelToSet

95
00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:16.166
and TurretToSet. OK so we've made an

96
00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:20.166
Initialize here. Let's go and define that now over in the .cpp.

97
00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:24.166
I'm going to do it in place of. actually. We don't need anymore of

98
00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:28.166
this SetBarrelReference and SetTurretReference. We're replacing those with just

99
00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:32.166
a single initializer there. which just says Barrel =

100
00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:36.166
BarrelToSet and Turret

101
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:40.166
= TurretToSet. No need to protect

102
00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:44.166
these incoming values. if they're null well we're going to get null. That's fine!

103
00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:48.166
OK. now I removed a couple of setters from the TankAiming

104
00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:52.166
Component. so these two SetBarrel and SetTurretReferences they can go in the same Aiming

105
00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:56.166
Component. we simply don't need those anymore. And the TankAimingComponent is reduced down to

106
00:06:56.166 --> 00:07:00.166
a constructor. which actually because of Unreal magic we can put in the private section.

107
00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:04.166
and I'm going to prefer to do that just so it gets it out of my public interface. Then. I have an Initialize

108
00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:08.166
which takes a couple of things and an AimAt. Protected. we

109
00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:12.166
have this FiringState. which we did a couple of videos ago. So yeah. we're all good to

110
00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:16.166
go! Let's just have a little recompile of this code. see if we

111
00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:20.166
missed anything. If it compiles. then I'll show you

112
00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:24.166
the code changes. and then. we'll start to create the actual problem

113
00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:28.166
because I've missed something. Some of you may have seen what I've missed here.

114
00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:32.166
I've done this refactoring. let's just see what compile error I have.

115
00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:36.166
" 'Barrel': undeclared identifier" in TankAimingComponent 22.

116
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:40.166
OK that's an interesting error. That error has nothing to do with the fact that

117
00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:44.166
it's an undeclared identifier. It's because. earlier on. when I made

118
00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:48.166
this Initialize method I didn't put

119
00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:52.166
the class in front of it. so the compiler has read through that. got very confused. and thinks

120
00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:56.166
the error is on line 22. whereas it's actually on 20. So let's recompile! That's definitely

121
00:07:56.166 --> 00:08:00.166
worth knowing! So when you see an error. just zoom out a little bit. don't get

122
00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:04.166
super focused on it. Ooh. it doesn't understand what this Barrel is! Yeah. but it doesn't understand what the Barrel is

123
00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:08.166
because it got stuck trying to read the line before. Yeah. so don't really trust

124
00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:12.166
the errors too too much. So we have another compile failure. which is again on

125
00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:16.166
line 27. We have a Barrel it doesn't understand.

126
00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:20.166
and that is because. in the Tank. I got rid of the Barrel

127
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:24.166
reference. I'm going to pop the Barrel reference back in the Tank. for the moment. in it's header file.

128
00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:28.166
Why? Because we are not dealing

129
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:32.166
with taking out this code in the Tank. the Fire code right now.

130
00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:36.166
so let's put that back. Now the source control will tell me

131
00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:40.166
what I took out of the tank header file. right now. and you can see one of the things I

132
00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:44.166
took out was this Barrel reference. So I'm going to put it back by copying

133
00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:48.166
it from source control. popping it back in like that. OK it's got a few extra characters with

134
00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:52.166
it but we'll live. But I'm going to say "// TODO

135
00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:56.166
Remove". because we know we're going to have to remove this at some point. because we want all of this stuff to go

136
00:08:56.166 --> 00:09:00.166
over to the AimingComponent. That's not the idea now. we're trying to do as little as possible.

137
00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:04.166
while it still compiles. We're just trying to get our thing compiling again. OK. so let's go back and

138
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:08.166
Compile. Don't boil the ocean here! You should be having a feeling. at

139
00:09:08.166 --> 00:09:12.166
this point. that you're a long way from a piece of compilable code. and that should worry you

140
00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:16.166
because you may not be able to get back to compilation. which means you'd need to revert to your

141
00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:20.166
previous commit. which would be a waste of your time. So hurry up to get it compiled!

142
00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:24.166
There you go. it has compiled! That is good! Alright. and that's all

143
00:09:24.166 --> 00:09:28.166
working. So let's Save All in here and then go into the

144
00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:32.166
tank blueprint. and we should now have. if we search for "initialize". a

145
00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:36.166
Tank Aiming Component initializer. We do! That's Fantastic! So let's now

146
00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:40.166
do the TankAimingComponent initialization. It doesn't matter

147
00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:44.166
whether it's done before or after the MovementComponent. the key is that we soft reference this Barrel

148
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:48.166
and this Turret. here in

149
00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:52.166
the blueprint.

150
00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:56.166
Great OK. so that is done! So let's just compile

151
00:09:56.166 --> 00:10:00.166
this up. That compiles. OK let's Save All and try playing.

152
00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:04.166
Oh dear. we get a hard crash

153
00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:08.166
of Unreal! Well every time we've had a hard crash of Unreal my normal response is.

154
00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:12.166
oh well that often happens. let's not worry about it! Let's just try opening the Editor again! But there are some times

155
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:16.166
Unreal has a paddy. when we make changes to blueprints. One thing I think of is.

156
00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:20.166
do my categories all have. are they all string referenced? Well they're not here. So

157
00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:24.166
one of my reactions to those types of hard crashes. at the moment. with the current bugs in

158
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:28.166
Unreal.  is to make sure these guys are string reference in here. And while I'm at it I

159
00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:32.166
would probably do a search for Category = or just Category

160
00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:36.166
across the entire project. And we've paid lip service to doing this before

161
00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:40.166
but let's now go and do it. Let's check where category appears. and wherever

162
00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:44.166
it appears. make sure it's properly string referenced. I know I skipped on there.

163
00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:48.166
so I'm going to have to go back and get that.

164
00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:52.166
So by paying lip service to something I mean saying oh we ought to. without

165
00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:56.166
doing anything. Always capture the idea or just deal with it immediately. Only

166
00:10:56.166 --> 00:11:00.166
don't deal with it immediately if doing so would really break your context. in that you feel

167
00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:04.166
like you're opening too many ideas in your mind in one go. Otherwise.

168
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:08.166
if you can deal with it immediately do. otherwise at least put a TODO in your code.

169
00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:12.166
so that you do come back and deal with it later. because. of course. we're going to be in the good habit

170
00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:16.166
of dealing with TODOs regularly. So I'm just going to search through that once more.

171
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:20.166
to make sure all my categories have a string

172
00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:24.166
referenced value against them. I think I missed one. OK fine. so

173
00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:28.166
that's done! OK. so that was a suspicion that it could be that. Let's recompile!

174
00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:32.166


175
00:11:32.166 --> 00:11:36.166
And once it's recompiled. I will open the tank blueprint.

176
00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:40.166
which is actually slightly broken which is interesting. Fix up the execution flow.

177
00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:44.166
Compile that. Save All. and play and we get

178
00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:48.166
a hard crash again! Oh dear! So the interesting thing about this

179
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:52.166
situation is. why is this hard crashing? So you could start saying. well let's look at

180
00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:56.166
the Tank implementation file. for a start. and let's look at all

181
00:11:56.166 --> 00:12:00.166
instances where we used say a Barrel. And you can say. well the Barrel pointer is

182
00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:04.166
protected there. you know. that's fine. etc. You could go through

183
00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:08.166
and start to try and work out where the problems are. Is it in the TankAiming

184
00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:12.166
Component? I don't know. Let's go look at the implementation file. Can we see somewhere

185
00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:16.166
where we're using unprotected pointers. Barrel. there's not Turret in this

186
00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:20.166
guy. MoveBarrelTowards is missing pointer protection. We should

187
00:12:20.166 --> 00:12:24.166
probably do that. because we use a Barrel and a Turret down here. and it makes no sense to

188
00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:28.166
try and move a Barrel without them. So we'd better say if not

189
00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:32.166
(!Barrel or II not

190
00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:36.166
!Turret) then .

191
00:12:36.166 --> 00:12:40.166
So could it be that? Now I'm guessing here. Now there's a better way than guessing.

192
00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:44.166
but let's just compile and see what happens! What I'm trying to get you the feeling of is. we're a long

193
00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:48.166
way from... Well we're not a long way from from compilation. we're a long way from a running project.

194
00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:52.166
You should be feeling by this amount of time working and this amount of changes. we're 12

195
00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:56.166
minutes into this video or a bit more. that I want to bring this

196
00:12:56.166 --> 00:13:00.166
to some sort of conclusion. because my source control is sitting with a bunch of uncommitted changes. I've

197
00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:04.166
obviously done work here but something's not working. So

198
00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:08.166
ah. it's compiled! Does it play?

199
00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:12.166
No it crashes! Alright. so at this point.

200
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:16.166
because of the length of this video and also because of the amount of code you've changed and

201
00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:20.166
the fact that you've made some progress right. we've refactored. A bunch of this

202
00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:24.166
stuff initializes into the TankAimingComponent! We've

203
00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:28.166
connected it up in Blueprint and it didn't compile. Then. we did a load of work. and

204
00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:32.166
now it does compile but it's hard crashing. I'm going to. I'm going to suggest that you

205
00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:36.166
would make a micro-commit here. In fact. I'm even going to make a Commit. and then.

206
00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:40.166
later I'm going to squash a couple of different commits together. So I'm going to say. here

207
00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:44.166
simply "Moved

208
00:13:44.166 --> 00:13:48.166
to" Blueprint "composition

209
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:52.166


210
00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:56.166
of Aiming Component

211
00:13:56.166 --> 00:14:00.166
now compiles but

212
00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:04.166
HARD CRASHES on run". And it's

213
00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:08.166
OK to make a temporary commit like that. to say OK I've got it as

214
00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:12.166
far as it compiling. Let's capture this work and now go about the

215
00:14:12.166 --> 00:14:16.166
job of trying to stop this hard crash. because at least it's compiling. Alright. and yes

216
00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:20.166
this messes up my list of lecture names. but we can actually

217
00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:24.166
squash things together later. I'm actually going to rename this commit to the same as the

218
00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:28.166
lecture name. but don't be afraid to make a commit because I will be showing you how you could. if you

219
00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:32.166
really have a particular vision for how your commits work. Just get it

220
00:14:32.166 --> 00:14:36.166
committed. because you can change stuff later. Alright. so we have got a

221
00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:40.166
fair distance down the road. We have changed the architecture. but

222
00:14:40.166 --> 00:14:44.166
we have a hard crash. In the next video. we are going to focus on how

223
00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:48.166
we're going to find the source of that hard crash. by attaching the VisualStudio

224
00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:52.166
Debugger. so that's going to be pretty cool! I'll see you in there!

225
00:14:52.166 --> 00:14:52.799


=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So hey, welcome back

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and welcome to Refactoring our Aiming Component. What we're going to do in this video is, we're going

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to change the architecture of the AimingComponent to use a single initialize method like

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
this, just like the Movement Component did, and then, to strip a whole load of code

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
out of the tank and start moving the functionality over to the AimingComponent. And yeah,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we're going to hit a brick wall in it, but I want you to hit that brick wall yourself.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Or you may not, you may do things slightly better than I have, but I want you to try and do this

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
reorganization. So look back at the video where we setup the Tank

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
MovementComponent, and see if you can get the TankAimingComponent to the

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
same sort of architecture, where it is actually added here in

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the Blueprint Editor and not added as

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
a default sub-object. So refactor the AimingComponent, try and move the Aiming

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Component to the same architecture, as I said. Don't worry if you can't get it working, but see if

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
you can get it at least as far as compiling. If you find your game hard crashes when you play

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or something, don't worry too much, but just see if you can get compiling and connected up in

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Blueprint, like I've got there. And that's going to be a great exercise for you! If you

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
struggle with this, don't worry, it's a pretty open-ended exercise. You're very welcome to stop and

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
just follow my solution. You don't need to feel bad about it, I'm setting a pretty nebulous challenge

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to allow for lots of different ranges of abilities to get their teeth stuck into this.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
OK so go ahead, pause the video, have a go at that, and when I come back, I will be going through

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and doing the refactor myself with you.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,166


23
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:28,166
So just before we dive in and start refactoring, let's just give ourselves a little bit of context.

24
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:32,166
Remember that the Movement Component is nicely separated with the Left and Right

25
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:36,166
Tracks, only bound to that component, but the Aiming Component still has this messy

26
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:40,166
loop, where the Tank has reference to the Barrel and they have these setters

27
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:44,166
being passed down, etc. So what we're going to do is move the Aiming Component into the same

28
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:48,166
paradigm as the Movement Component, that is added in Blueprint using an Initialize()

29
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:52,166
method, etc. So I'm going to go through this with you and do some refactoring. You're welcome to try and do

30
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:56,166
the refactor yourself. You know the experienced among you can certainly do that, just

31
00:01:56,166 --> 00:02:00,166
bring the Aiming Component into the same pattern as the Movement Component. And then, I'm going to lead us to

32
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:04,166
the point at which we have a horrible hard crash, which will be with no particularly obvious

33
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,166
source, and then, we're going to use the debugger, the VisualStudio debugger

34
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:12,166
to actually fix that up. So let's just start this refactor process.

35
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,166
Let's have the tank blueprint open, so we can remind ourselves that one of the things we are

36
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:20,166
trying to get rid of is this Set Turret and Set Barrel Reference.

37
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:24,166
In fact, let's be brave and just delete them, we don't need those anymore. We're going to have an Initialize()

38
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:28,166
method on our TankAimingComponent, of course. So let's go

39
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:32,166
break some stuff! Over in the tank header file, let's start off!

40
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:36,166
I think I'm actually going to start at the top and just fix up my copyright notice, as I

41
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:40,166
did in the TankMovementComponent. So let's just do the Copyright notice for the tank header

42
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,166
file and the TankAimingComponent header file.

43
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:48,166
They're the two things we're going to be working on. It kind of signals to me, I've touched this thing recently.

44
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:52,166
Sure if I had of set it in the Project Settings in the beginning then it'd be set, but whenever

45
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:56,166
you notice a problem like this, let's fix it as we go. So in the tank header file we have this

46
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:00,166
SetTurret and SetBarrel reference. Don't need them, let's get rid of them! Both the SetTurret and SetBarrel

47
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:04,166
References. Let's remove those and let's remove the code that actually does that setting.

48
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:08,166
So that's great! We can also get rid of, in the ATank

49
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:12,166
BeginPlay(), you'll notice we're not using it, so let's just ditch it. And let's ditch it from the

50
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:16,166
header file as well, if it's in there. You can always put it back, it's really easy to put back again

51
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:20,166
OK. And SetupPlayerInputComponent, we're not using that either, so I'm taking Setup

52
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:24,166
PlayerInputComponent out of the Tank as well, as we're trying to clear

53
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,166
up the Tank. Let's clear it up properly! OK, now over in the Tank,

54
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,166
the other thing that we're doing is creating a default sub-object of a TankAimingComponent.

55
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:36,166
Remember what that does? It makes this TankAimingComponent inherited here, which we don't have

56
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:40,166
any details for, and it's different to the TankMovementComponent, so we're going to stop doing

57
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:44,166
that! Let's delete the TankAimingComponent DefaultSubobjectCreation there,

58
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:48,166
and then, let's

59
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:52,166
recompile. I think it'll recompile at this stage.

60
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:56,166
Now, I did a lot of code in a very short amount of time there, so what I'll do is I'll do you the favor.

61
00:03:56,166 --> 00:04:00,166
Now that hitting Compile has saved all the tabs in VisualStudio, I can  come

62
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:04,166
into SourceTree, while it compiles, and I can show you what I've done. I've deleted a load of code from the

63
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:08,166
Tank.cpp, all of this stuff that you can see on the screen there. I'll leave it for you for a second.

64
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,166
And then, you can see what I've done in the header file,

65
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:16,166
removed the relevant references that's all, and then, in the AimingComponent I've just

66
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:20,166
changed my Copyright notice. OK, so there are the changes. Now the hot reload worked.

67
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,166
Now lets go look at the tank blueprint! We no longer have this inherited TankAimingComponent.

68
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:28,166
Fantastic! So let's add it back! Now, will it be visible? Well it will be visible in the

69
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:32,166
Custom section, if we made it the correct type of U...

70
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:36,166
Well let's go and have a look! Remember in the TankMovementComponent header file,

71
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:40,166
we annotated as a (BlueprintSpawnableComponent).

72
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,166
Well let's go and have a look in the TankAimingComponent header

73
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,166
file, and it is already a (BlueprintSpawnableComponent). If

74
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:52,166
yours isn't, of course, you need this annotation on the TankAimingComponent. Great! So

75
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,166
because it's BlueprintSpawnable I can come in here and I can add it as a

76
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:00,166
TankAimingComponent. Great! There it is looking just like the TankMovementComponent, and we can

77
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:04,166
actually see the properties on it now. That's fun! Now what we need is one of these Initialize()

78
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,166
methods for the TankMovementComponent. So I'm going to go... Ah sorry, not for

79
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:12,166
the TankAimingComponent. I'm going to go look at the TankMovementComponent's Initialize() method, and

80
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,166
I think I won't copy it because it's so different but I just want to remind

81
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:20,166
myself how that works. I'm using the English spelling of Initialise and I'm just

82
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,166
setting some references. So on the TankAimingComponent, we have

83
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:28,166
these pointers to the Barrel and Turret, which is great! We don't need them on the tank anymore,

84
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,166
by the way. So if you look at the tank, we don't need a Barrel reference anymore. Let's delete that from the

85
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,166
Tank, that's no longer necessary. And then, in the Tank

86
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:40,166
AimingComponent we're going to need a new Initialize() method. Now it's going to need to be public,

87
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:44,166
isn't it? And it's also going to need to have the same signature as it does in the MovementComponent, so

88
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:48,166
I will use the MovementComponent for that. Here (BlueprintCallable, Category

89
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:52,166
= "Setup") and then it's this Initialize. So let's just use that as inspiration.

90
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:56,166
And then, be very careful to immediately change it from a UTank

91
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:00,166
Track pointer to a UTank

92
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:04,166
Barrel pointer and a UTank

93
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:08,166
Turret pointer. And then, it's

94
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:12,166
going to be BarrelToSet

95
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:16,166
and TurretToSet. OK so we've made an

96
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:20,166
Initialize here. Let's go and define that now over in the .cpp.

97
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,166
I'm going to do it in place of, actually. We don't need anymore of

98
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,166
this SetBarrelReference and SetTurretReference. We're replacing those with just

99
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,166
a single initializer there, which just says Barrel =

100
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:36,166
BarrelToSet and Turret

101
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,166
= TurretToSet. No need to protect

102
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:44,166
these incoming values, if they're null well we're going to get null. That's fine!

103
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:48,166
OK, now I removed a couple of setters from the TankAiming

104
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,166
Component, so these two SetBarrel and SetTurretReferences they can go in the same Aiming

105
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:56,166
Component, we simply don't need those anymore. And the TankAimingComponent is reduced down to

106
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,166
a constructor, which actually because of Unreal magic we can put in the private section,

107
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:04,166
and I'm going to prefer to do that just so it gets it out of my public interface. Then, I have an Initialize

108
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,166
which takes a couple of things and an AimAt. Protected, we

109
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:12,166
have this FiringState, which we did a couple of videos ago. So yeah, we're all good to

110
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,166
go! Let's just have a little recompile of this code, see if we

111
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,166
missed anything. If it compiles, then I'll show you

112
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,166
the code changes, and then, we'll start to create the actual problem

113
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:28,166
because I've missed something. Some of you may have seen what I've missed here.

114
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:32,166
I've done this refactoring, let's just see what compile error I have.

115
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:36,166
" 'Barrel': undeclared identifier" in TankAimingComponent 22.

116
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,166
OK that's an interesting error. That error has nothing to do with the fact that

117
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:44,166
it's an undeclared identifier. It's because, earlier on, when I made

118
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:48,166
this Initialize method I didn't put

119
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:52,166
the class in front of it, so the compiler has read through that, got very confused, and thinks

120
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:56,166
the error is on line 22, whereas it's actually on 20. So let's recompile! That's definitely

121
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:00,166
worth knowing! So when you see an error, just zoom out a little bit, don't get

122
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,166
super focused on it. Ooh, it doesn't understand what this Barrel is! Yeah, but it doesn't understand what the Barrel is

123
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:08,166
because it got stuck trying to read the line before. Yeah, so don't really trust

124
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:12,166
the errors too too much. So we have another compile failure, which is again on

125
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:16,166
line 27. We have a Barrel it doesn't understand,

126
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:20,166
and that is because, in the Tank, I got rid of the Barrel

127
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,166
reference. I'm going to pop the Barrel reference back in the Tank, for the moment, in it's header file.

128
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:28,166
Why? Because we are not dealing

129
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:32,166
with taking out this code in the Tank, the Fire code right now,

130
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:36,166
so let's put that back. Now the source control will tell me

131
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,166
what I took out of the tank header file, right now, and you can see one of the things I

132
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:44,166
took out was this Barrel reference. So I'm going to put it back by copying

133
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:48,166
it from source control, popping it back in like that. OK it's got a few extra characters with

134
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,166
it but we'll live. But I'm going to say "// TODO

135
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,166
Remove", because we know we're going to have to remove this at some point, because we want all of this stuff to go

136
00:08:56,166 --> 00:09:00,166
over to the AimingComponent. That's not the idea now, we're trying to do as little as possible,

137
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:04,166
while it still compiles. We're just trying to get our thing compiling again. OK, so let's go back and

138
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,166
Compile. Don't boil the ocean here! You should be having a feeling, at

139
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,166
this point, that you're a long way from a piece of compilable code, and that should worry you

140
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:16,166
because you may not be able to get back to compilation, which means you'd need to revert to your

141
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:20,166
previous commit, which would be a waste of your time. So hurry up to get it compiled!

142
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:24,166
There you go, it has compiled! That is good! Alright, and that's all

143
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,166
working. So let's Save All in here and then go into the

144
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:32,166
tank blueprint, and we should now have, if we search for "initialize", a

145
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:36,166
Tank Aiming Component initializer. We do! That's Fantastic! So let's now

146
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:40,166
do the TankAimingComponent initialization. It doesn't matter

147
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,166
whether it's done before or after the MovementComponent, the key is that we soft reference this Barrel

148
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,166
and this Turret, here in

149
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:52,166
the blueprint.

150
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:56,166
Great OK, so that is done! So let's just compile

151
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,166
this up. That compiles. OK let's Save All and try playing.

152
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,166
Oh dear, we get a hard crash

153
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,166
of Unreal! Well every time we've had a hard crash of Unreal my normal response is,

154
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:12,166
oh well that often happens, let's not worry about it! Let's just try opening the Editor again! But there are some times

155
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:16,166
Unreal has a paddy, when we make changes to blueprints. One thing I think of is,

156
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,166
do my categories all have, are they all string referenced? Well they're not here. So

157
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,166
one of my reactions to those types of hard crashes, at the moment, with the current bugs in

158
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,166
Unreal,  is to make sure these guys are string reference in here. And while I'm at it I

159
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:32,166
would probably do a search for Category = or just Category

160
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,166
across the entire project. And we've paid lip service to doing this before

161
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:40,166
but let's now go and do it. Let's check where category appears, and wherever

162
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:44,166
it appears, make sure it's properly string referenced. I know I skipped on there,

163
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:48,166
so I'm going to have to go back and get that.

164
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:52,166
So by paying lip service to something I mean saying oh we ought to, without

165
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:56,166
doing anything. Always capture the idea or just deal with it immediately. Only

166
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,166
don't deal with it immediately if doing so would really break your context, in that you feel

167
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:04,166
like you're opening too many ideas in your mind in one go. Otherwise,

168
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:08,166
if you can deal with it immediately do, otherwise at least put a TODO in your code,

169
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:12,166
so that you do come back and deal with it later, because, of course, we're going to be in the good habit

170
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:16,166
of dealing with TODOs regularly. So I'm just going to search through that once more,

171
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,166
to make sure all my categories have a string

172
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,166
referenced value against them. I think I missed one. OK fine, so

173
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,166
that's done! OK, so that was a suspicion that it could be that. Let's recompile!

174
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:32,166


175
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:36,166
And once it's recompiled, I will open the tank blueprint,

176
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:40,166
which is actually slightly broken which is interesting. Fix up the execution flow,

177
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,166
Compile that, Save All, and play and we get

178
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,166
a hard crash again! Oh dear! So the interesting thing about this

179
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,166
situation is, why is this hard crashing? So you could start saying, well let's look at

180
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:56,166
the Tank implementation file, for a start, and let's look at all

181
00:11:56,166 --> 00:12:00,166
instances where we used say a Barrel. And you can say, well the Barrel pointer is

182
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:04,166
protected there, you know, that's fine, etc. You could go through

183
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:08,166
and start to try and work out where the problems are. Is it in the TankAiming

184
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,166
Component? I don't know. Let's go look at the implementation file. Can we see somewhere

185
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:16,166
where we're using unprotected pointers. Barrel, there's not Turret in this

186
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:20,166
guy. MoveBarrelTowards is missing pointer protection. We should

187
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:24,166
probably do that, because we use a Barrel and a Turret down here, and it makes no sense to

188
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,166
try and move a Barrel without them. So we'd better say if not

189
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:32,166
(!Barrel or II not

190
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,166
!Turret) then .

191
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,166
So could it be that? Now I'm guessing here. Now there's a better way than guessing,

192
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:44,166
but let's just compile and see what happens! What I'm trying to get you the feeling of is, we're a long

193
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:48,166
way from... Well we're not a long way from from compilation, we're a long way from a running project.

194
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:52,166
You should be feeling by this amount of time working and this amount of changes, we're 12

195
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:56,166
minutes into this video or a bit more, that I want to bring this

196
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:00,166
to some sort of conclusion, because my source control is sitting with a bunch of uncommitted changes. I've

197
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:04,166
obviously done work here but something's not working. So

198
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:08,166
ah, it's compiled! Does it play?

199
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:12,166
No it crashes! Alright, so at this point,

200
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,166
because of the length of this video and also because of the amount of code you've changed and

201
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:20,166
the fact that you've made some progress right, we've refactored. A bunch of this

202
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:24,166
stuff initializes into the TankAimingComponent! We've

203
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:28,166
connected it up in Blueprint and it didn't compile. Then, we did a load of work, and

204
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,166
now it does compile but it's hard crashing. I'm going to, I'm going to suggest that you

205
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:36,166
would make a micro-commit here. In fact, I'm even going to make a Commit, and then,

206
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:40,166
later I'm going to squash a couple of different commits together. So I'm going to say, here

207
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:44,166
simply "Moved

208
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:48,166
to" Blueprint "composition

209
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:52,166


210
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:56,166
of Aiming Component

211
00:13:56,166 --> 00:14:00,166
now compiles but

212
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:04,166
HARD CRASHES on run". And it's

213
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:08,166
OK to make a temporary commit like that, to say OK I've got it as

214
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:12,166
far as it compiling. Let's capture this work and now go about the

215
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:16,166
job of trying to stop this hard crash, because at least it's compiling. Alright, and yes

216
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:20,166
this messes up my list of lecture names, but we can actually

217
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:24,166
squash things together later. I'm actually going to rename this commit to the same as the

218
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:28,166
lecture name, but don't be afraid to make a commit because I will be showing you how you could, if you

219
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:32,166
really have a particular vision for how your commits work. Just get it

220
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:36,166
committed, because you can change stuff later. Alright, so we have got a

221
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,166
fair distance down the road. We have changed the architecture, but

222
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:44,166
we have a hard crash. In the next video, we are going to focus on how

223
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:48,166
we're going to find the source of that hard crash, by attaching the VisualStudio

224
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,166
Debugger, so that's going to be pretty cool! I'll see you in there!
