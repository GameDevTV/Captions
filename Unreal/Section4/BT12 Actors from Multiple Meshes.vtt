00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this video we're going to be

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
making up actors from multiple meshes. You'll basically import the

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
tank in 4 static mesh parts, assemble the parts using sockets,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then, we'll create a tank blueprint and test. By the end of it, you'll have

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
something looking something like this. An untextured, but otherwise pretty cool

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.666
tank, and a corresponding blueprint and all of the parts assembled properly. So, let's go and make that happen!

7
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:29.700
So, let's finally put this tank together! In the resources

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.700
attached to this lecture, you should find the battle tank, well the

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.433
TankParts.zip file. If you open that up you'll have a bunch of .fbx's.

10
00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:42.433
So before I go any further I'd like to thank Robert Wu, one of our students

11
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:46.433
who kindly donated this tank model for the course, and you can find a link

12
00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.700
to his Facebook profile in the resources of this lecture.

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.666
So, let's get those into Unreal! There's a few ways to do this. You can either be in

14
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:57.633
Unreal, and in your Content Browser you can right-click... In fact, let's make a

15
00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:01.633
folder for the tank. So make a folder for the tank, and then,

16
00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:05.600
in that folder, we can right-click and say Import to/Game/Tank

17
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.566
folder. We can do that! Point it at the Downloads, TankParts,

18
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:13.600
and then, we could select them all. That's one way or we could have dragged them in, but I'm going to do it the way

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.633
of just selecting. So, I'm importing into the tank, new

20
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:21.633
Tank folder. I'm going to use the default import settings. Ideally, if you're working

21
00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:25.633
with a modeler, they will set things up so you don't have to mess around here.

22
00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:29.600
And then, we're going to get 4 skeletal mesh, not skeletal, but

23
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.633
static meshes, that don't have bones and things, in here. There they go! There's actually

24
00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:37.633
some materials with them; we could delete those materials because we're going to recreate our own

25
00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:41.600
materials later. So, ditch the materials, and you can even force delete

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.566
them, it doesn't matter. And now, let's take a look at these meshes one at a time. So we've got

27
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:49.566
a barrel. You can dock this barrel to the top. There it is, nice

28
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:53.600
sitting there perfectly OK. What else do we have?

29
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.566
We have a body, and there it is sitting on the origin. The

30
00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:01.566
00 point's about the middle of the bottom of the tank there.

31
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:05.533
We'll see why that matters in a little bit. Let's take a look at the rest, we've got some tracks,

32
00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:09.533
again sitting on the origin there and a turret sitting on the ground,

33
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:13.566
and that's all good stuff!

34
00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:17.566
And the barrel is also sitting on the ground. Good! So, I'm just checking that all

35
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:21.533
of these models are sitting, so that the position that we want to attach

36
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:25.533
them to something else is at 00, is at the origin. And that's how your rmodels

37
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.500
need to be specified from your designer for Unreal. Certainly if you're using

38
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500
Blender, there's no way to bring in the pivot points, so we want

39
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.533
our models to be done like this. The tank sits so it centers in the middle

40
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:41.566
there. The track, the center of the track is in the middle.

41
00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:45.566
The position that the turret here is going to connect to the tank is sitting on the

42
00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:49.566
origin, so that's important, but we've done all that for you. So, basically import those

43
00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:53.566
meshes and we're good to go. Alright, so now we're going to make, in this same Tank folder,

44
00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:57.566
we're going to make ourself a new basic Blueprint Class.

45
00:02:57.566 --> 00:03:01.600
OK, so create a basic asset Blueprint Class in the Tank folder.

46
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.566
Now, what's it going to be based on? Let's have a think about this. Is it an actor? Well, an Actor

47
00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:09.566
doesn't have enough coming with it, because it doesn't

48
00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:13.600
allow for possession and receiving of input from a controller. So, if we based in on an Actor,

49
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.633
we would have to do a load of stuff that is already done for us, in the Pawn, remembering

50
00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:21.666
that the Pawn inherits from the Actor and the Character inherits from the

51
00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:25.700
Pawn. It's like a family tree, remember, so as we

52
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.700
go down from Actor to Pawn to Character, we're getting more and more. But a Character gives us

53
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.700
too much. It's all about AI, which yeah we're going to use some AI, but we're going to

54
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.733
use very simplified AI. But if you look at this description, we're not going to be using,

55
00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:41.700
you know it's not a vertically oriented player that can walk, jump, fly and

56
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.666
swim yeah. It's just too much for a tank, so Pawn is the appropriate

57
00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:49.666
class to base it on. So, there you go! Now, let's call it Tank_BP.

58
00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:53.700
Oops, it doesn't matter if you missed, just rename... F2, by the way,

59
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.700
will also rename for you. So, there's the Tank_BP.

60
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.733
Great! Now, let's open it up and make sure it's docked. It is,

61
00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:05.766
i.e. along the top here. Now later, we can

62
00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:09.766
reparent this class. Now remember, of course, if you don't like the way that toolbar looks, remember you can right-

63
00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:13.766
click up or left-click here rather, and you then get the handle.

64
00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:17.733
You can then drag the handle along the top if you need to. So,

65
00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:21.733
like so, alright and then you could hide that again. Now, remember later

66
00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:25.766
in the class settings, we're going to be able to change the parent class from a Pawn,

67
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:29.733
there it is, to something that we create ourselves called a Tank.h but not yet. Let's just build

68
00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:33.700
the tank for now. Alright, so in the spirit of building the tank, let's go ahead

69
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.700
and get on with it. Let's show you how to do it, and then, you can come in and finish it off.

70
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.700
So, we're going to add a static mesh to the tank, I'm going to call it Tank.

71
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.666
There you go! I'm going to go and choose the tank body static mesh,

72
00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:49.666
like so. So there it is! This is the beginnings of our

73
00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:53.700
tank. Now, in order to put the turret on the tank, in the middle of this, we're

74
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.733
going to use something called a socket for positioning. So, I'm going to add a socket. Now, there are bugs

75
00:04:57.733 --> 00:05:01.700
with sockets, I warn you, so watch carefully. The way you

76
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.733
add the socket is, you add the socket to the tank body mesh.

77
00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:09.766
So, we can find the mesh with the little icon here, or

78
00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.733
we could, so that by the icon here I'm saying in the Details Tab under Static Mesh.

79
00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:17.733
Right there you've got Browse To, that takes you to it in the Content Browser.

80
00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:21.733
OK, so if we open up the mesh here...

81
00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:25.733
Remember the purple thing is the collision mesh, it's generated as quite a sensible one, so we'll leave

82
00:05:25.733 --> 00:05:29.766
that for now. We create a socket. Now be careful, don't rename it now. If you rename it now,

83
00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:33.766
the bug that's in this version of Unreal will stop it working. So just create it,

84
00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:37.766
call it Socket. Then, we're going to go and choose ourselves a preview mesh,

85
00:05:37.766 --> 00:05:41.766
this allows us to position the socket. So, it's the turret that we are positioning,

86
00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:45.733
so choose the turret as the preview mesh there. Then, if you

87
00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:49.733
drag the socket up, you see the turret comes with it. How cool is that? So this is your

88
00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:53.766
opportunity now to get the socket in the right place, so with the socket selected,

89
00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:57.800
you just get it to where it should be. I think it's about 150 in Z.

90
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.800
There you go, it looks pretty good! Now, if

91
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.800
you want to be able to rename the socket, don't do it yet. You need to Clear

92
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.833
the preview, like so, it's in the dropdown

93
00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:13.800
to Clear. Now, you can rename the socket

94
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.800
to Turret. I know I know, it's terrible isn't it! Now make sure you save your blueprint.

95
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.833
You can see it's not saved because there's a star there, and then, we

96
00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:25.800
have done the first thing we need to do. Cool! Nice! OK,

97
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.766
let me show you that again for reinforcement, then, I think I'll get you to do the tracks.

98
00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:33.733
So now, we're going to add another static mesh. Note curiously that if

99
00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:37.700
you try and add one, it's going to try and add one using the same tank_fbx

100
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.733
static mesh, and that's because it's selected here in the content

101
00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:45.733
Browser. If you deselect it and go back to the tank blueprint, you can now just

102
00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:49.700
add an empty static mesh, which probably makes more sense. Call it the

103
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.733
Turret. Now importantly, we child the Turret by dragging under the tank like this.

104
00:06:53.733 --> 00:06:57.766
Now, go and find the Turret

105
00:06:57.766 --> 00:07:01.733
and we're nearly there, but the Turret is hidden, especially if we go to Wireframe mode,

106
00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:05.733
you'll be able to see this. There that Turret is hidden inside the

107
00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:09.766
tank OK. That's OK, that's what we expect at this point. What we want to do

108
00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:13.766
is to then say to the Turret, your parent socket here

109
00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:17.733
is the turret socket that we put on the tank body. And

110
00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:21.700
boom, it snaps to it! You get the idea. Pretty cool hey!

111
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.733
Alright, so that is the turret done. Now, what I want you to do is

112
00:07:25.733 --> 00:07:29.733
to go ahead and do the same magic for the barrel. So, your

113
00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:33.733
challenge is as follows. Import the barrel, basically. Import the .fbx

114
00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:37.733
file, it's already done for you. Create a socket on the turret. You can eyeball its

115
00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:41.766
position and also use the preview mesh, but remember the

116
00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:45.800
tricks. Remember that you don't rename the socket until you've added the preview mesh,

117
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.833
positioned it, then you remove the preview mesh, then you can rename your socket. I'm sorry, on Unreal's

118
00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:53.866
part that that's the case. Create the child and

119
00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:57.900
link it and set the socket and just check it all looks and rotates OK. So

120
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.900
go ahead, pause the video, and see if you can get the barrel setup now.

121
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.933
OK welcome back!

122
00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:09.966
So, let's do this barrel thing! Remember with nothing selected over here or,

123
00:08:09.966 --> 00:08:13.933
if you like, with the barrel selected over here in the Content Browser, you

124
00:08:13.933 --> 00:08:17.933
can add yourself a static mesh, it will have a reference to the barrel then.

125
00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:21.966
I'm going to just call it Barrel. Drag it under the Turret.

126
00:08:21.966 --> 00:08:25.966
Now, that's on it's way! Now, does the Turret

127
00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:29.933
currently have a socket? It doesn't does it? So, we're going to add a socket to the Turret.

128
00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:33.933
I'm going to use the barrel as the preview mesh,

129
00:08:33.933 --> 00:08:37.900
then move the socket to where we want it to be. Now you may

130
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.900
want to be rotating this to check that it works. Yeah, that looks

131
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.900
pretty good about there. So, my position for your reference is

132
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.900
at X is 100, and let's call it 110, nice round numbers and

133
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.900
that the Z is at say 13, something like that. Just going to have a

134
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.900
slightly closer look, make sure it looks reasonably good here. Our designer will

135
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.866
kill us if we put it in the wrong place. I think it's too low personally, so I'm going to move that socket

136
00:09:01.866 --> 00:09:05.900
up to say 15 and 20

137
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.933
and 22. [Laughs] OK, at

138
00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:13.933
about 22 it's looking about right. Again check it rotates.

139
00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:17.900
That bit that sticks out of the bottom is going to go inside of the model, so we don't mind, and it can go low enough.

140
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.900
Good! OK! So, I'm going to leave that there like that.

141
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.866
Now, that socket, we can remove the

142
00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:29.866
preview mesh. Clear the preview mesh, like so,

143
00:09:29.866 --> 00:09:33.833
and then, we can now rename it to Barrel. Horrible I know but

144
00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:37.800
it's what it is. Save it, make sure you save it. Back to the tank.

145
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.833
Now, we go to the Barrel and we say, what's your parent socket? Well, now you can

146
00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:45.833
say here it's the Barrel. Now if

147
00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:49.866
your Barrel ends up on the floor like this, that's because at some point Unreal has changed the default

148
00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:53.900
location of the Barrel. The location of the turret

149
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.933
should be 0 0 0, and the Barrel should be 0 0 0 relative

150
00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:01.900
to the socket. So, I've clicked Reset so we're at 0 0 0,

151
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.866
and now we have things positioned as we wanted them. Let's check it all works.

152
00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:09.900
If, for example, I rotate here the Turret, the Barrel is going

153
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.900
with it. That's cool! And of course, I can rotate the Barrel as we did in the preview.

154
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.900
Great, we have a tank pretty much together! I'm just going to put the

155
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.933
tracks on now. That's a relatively simple job. Now the tracks, of course, are connected directly

156
00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:25.933
to the tank. So, let's go to the Track,

157
00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:29.966
back to the Tank blueprint, add ourself a Track,

158
00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:34.000
call it Left Track.

159
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.966
Then, it's a job of positioning it.

160
00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:41.933
So, I'm going to select Left Track, go into the Viewport,

161
00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:45.900
get my W key shortcut. Now,

162
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.900
we need a Left Track socket. Don't try and position it yet.

163
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.866
Remember, we want a Left Track socket on the tank itself,

164
00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:57.866
right, so we go to the tank body. We create a socket

165
00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:01.900
called left track or right track? I'm going left track, so Left Track.

166
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.866
I'm going to select a preview mesh, which is the track,

167
00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:09.866
which will allow me to position this track, so here we go!

168
00:11:09.866 --> 00:11:13.900
Now, I made the mistake didn't I? I

169
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.900
renamed the socket before I move it, and because of this

170
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.866
nasty bug it doesn't work. So, if it happens to you, delete it, create

171
00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:25.900
a new socket, leave it named as it was, as I told you to, and then, I know I ignored my own advice.

172
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.933
Add the track in, position it. So we need to

173
00:11:29.933 --> 00:11:33.900
look a bit more carefully to do that. It's still called Socket.

174
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.933
And I might position this more finely, at a future point, but I think

175
00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:41.933
that roughly right is good enough here. And I'll get you some

176
00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:45.900
figures that you can use, if you just want to use my figures.

177
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.866
Again, you might be using your own tank model, so my figures are here for you,

178
00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:53.833
if you care. There you go! So, let's say about

179
00:11:53.833 --> 00:11:57.800
30 -160 for round numbers and about -

180
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.800
-6 in the Z. OK, that's where I think the socket,

181
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.766
the left socket should be. Now, remember you need to Clear the preview mesh,

182
00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:09.733
before then renaming it Left Track. How do I know it's left? Because

183
00:12:09.733 --> 00:12:13.700
the front of the tank or the back of the tank has these

184
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.666
barrels on it here, these things. OK, so that's the Left

185
00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:21.633
Track. Now for the Right Track, I want to do something very similar. I'm going to try just duplicating it,

186
00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:25.666
and that should work actually, because I don't need the

187
00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:29.700
preview mesh for this, because all I'm doing is looking at the Y coordinate

188
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.733
and just setting that to the opposite. So the only things that change

189
00:12:33.733 --> 00:12:37.700
are the Y, minus some tiny floating point error there. Good OK,

190
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.733
rename Right Track. Good, so we've got a Left Track and a Right Track

191
00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:45.700
socket on the tank. Let's save that! Back to the tank blueprint! Now,

192
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.700
the Left tank, Track should be very simply attached to the Left

193
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.666
Track socket. Now the reason

194
00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:57.700
it's not showing up is because it can't find a Left Track socket here, because we haven't yet

195
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.733
childed the track to the tank. Once it's a child of the tank, the Left

196
00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:05.733
Track socket will be available, and we want to Duplicate this

197
00:13:05.733 --> 00:13:09.766
guy, call it Right Track, and just the only thing that changes

198
00:13:09.766 --> 00:13:13.733
is it's socket should be the Right Track. Look at that, we have a tank.

199
00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:17.733
It's a miracle! [laughs] OK, I'm just going to compile this blueprint,

200
00:13:17.733 --> 00:13:21.733
Save All, and as a final pièce de résistance, if you like, I'm going

201
00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:25.733
to find the Tank blueprint, drag it into the world, and look at that, a tank in the

202
00:13:25.733 --> 00:13:29.766
world. We can look at it, we can move it around, we can

203
00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:33.700
do what we like. We can't rotate its barrel from here, because it's a single piece actor once it's in the

204
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.666
world. I think I've got a track in the wrong place? No I haven't! No we're good!

205
00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:41.700
So, there you go, we have a tank! Awesome!

206
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.566
