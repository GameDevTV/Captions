1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Target Points and Patrol Routes! What we're going to do in this video is use these

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
little markers here, called Target Points, to work as waypoints for the

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
soldiers to be moving around, and then, we're going to provide a facility for each of the

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
guards to have certain Target Points that he visits like this one. This guy has

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
three or four, and this other guy has different Target Points. But they're also

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.600
sharing one of them, and they're sharing the one that's upstairs here. So go ahead and take a look at how we get this done!

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.600
So if we're going to setup the sort of patrolling behavior I showed you a

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.600
few videos ago, then obviously this method of programming it all

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600
individually inside the blueprint is going to get very cumbersome indeed.

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.600
What we want to be able to do is put something down, physically in the world, something called a

12
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.600
Target Point, and then, it's very easy for

13
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.600
us or the designer to move those target points around. And then later, we can hang

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.600
further information off those Target Points, like how long should the AI loiter at

15
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.600
this point or anything else that we want. So we need to setup an

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600
architecture of Target Points, and then, have a way for a given

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.600
instance of an AI character like this specifying the Target Point's,

18
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.600
that he or she should be visiting. So let's

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.600
start off by just looking at the blueprint for this AI character.

20
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.600
So let's just go find that somewhere in, I think it's in Third

21
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.600
PersonCharacterCPP. There you go, ThirdPersonCharacter! Let's go edit the blueprint!

22
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.600
Now that didn't open up in the tab how I wanted it to, Unreal

23
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.600
seems to forget that setting sometimes. So I'm going to go to my Editor Preferences

24
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.600
and right here, Asset Editor Open Location, then Main Window.

25
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.600
Just keep beating it into shape! Set that as Default,

26
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600
make my settings writable. So I said Set as Default, make

27
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.600
settings writable. It's warned me that it may effect other developers. Well I'm the only developer here, at the moment.

28
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600
That's fine for now. And I'm just going to go ahead and check, in source control, that that's

29
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.600
setting has been properly saved. It should have actually made a change to

30
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.600
this .ini file. And it looks like it has! Good!

31
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.600
And it's right down here. Alright! Anyway, so what we want to

32
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.600
do is, inside this ThirdPersonCharacter, I'm going to open up the full blueprint. It's just I find it

33
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600
easier to navigate and give myself some sight here. What we're going to do is start off

34
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.600
with a Blueprint Variable that is going to allow to store an

35
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.600
array of target points, and then, we'll also talk about

36
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
what target points are and get those setup. So if you go to the My

37
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.600
Blueprint tab, of the ThirdPersonCharacter blueprint,

38
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.600
we can add a new variable here and I'm going to call it Patrol

39
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.600
Points. Now, if I can put a space in blueprint, I do just

40
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.600
because it reads more clearly. And we're going to go ahead and look

41
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.600
at what it is. Now, do we have something of Target Point type? We

42
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.600
do! Great! Alright, so we want a reference to a

43
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.600
Target Point! As I said, we'll see what target points are in a moment, but I just want to get the variables setup

44
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.600
first. Now, whenever we've made a blueprint variable before, it's all very well, it sits here.

45
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600
And if I compile this blueprint and look at an instance

46
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.600
like this dude here and now search for "patrol",

47
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.600
then provided you've made it visible, you see

48
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.600
this little eye, you have to click visible here. Recompile so you have a Patrol Point

49
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.600
variable, compiled with an eye. If we now look here

50
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.600
we see, under the Default category, that category, by the way, is set here. You see

51
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.600
category Default. Default's not descriptive, so we could call it

52
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.600
Patrol Root or Route if you like, if you're American. So I make the category

53
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.600
Patrol Route, and then over here on the guy

54
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.600
we have a Patrol Route section. Here it is, buried somewhere!

55
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.600
Patrol Route, and it's saying, tell me what the Patrol Points are, but it's only asking me

56
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.600
to select a single Patrol Point. We want multiple Patrol Points, so

57
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.600
how do you organize that? Well, for the first time, we're going to make our blueprint variable, not just a

58
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.600
single but an array. So you literally just click this button here, that turns it

59
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.600
into an array. Alright, if we recompile now

60
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.600
you can see that you would be able to add multiple elements here to the

61
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.600
archetype or probably, more usefully, to the specific instance here.

62
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600
We can now come in, we can go down, find the patrol setup

63
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600
area, or it might be easier, because he's got so many properties, just to type that, and

64
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600
you can start adding multiple Patrol Points. Cool! Alright,

65
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.600
so I'm just going to remove all of those patrol points and start talking about what these

66
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.600
Target Points actually are in the world. So if you go now to

67
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.600
Modes and you look for Target, you'll find a Target Point,

68
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.600
and you can drop that into the world. And now, let's just take a little look

69
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600
at it! What is it? Well firstly, you can see it! There it is, it's rendered like a billboard, it's

70
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.600
always facing the camera, so it doesn't matter where we go, it doesn't really have three dimensionality to it.

71
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.600
And then, you get a load of options on this Target Point! If we click

72
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.600
on it here, you can see that it's got a Sprite icon here, and you can get various different

73
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.600
screen sizes that you can increase and decrease, but whether or not that

74
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.600
will take effect depends on all sorts of factors. So let's not worry too much about screen size,

75
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.600
for the moment. The default is there and it's good enough, we can

76
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.600
see it, which is what we're after. Alright, so there's other factors

77
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.600
here, to do with the UV Mapping, etc. ect. and Editor Scaling, and

78
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.600
all of these will effect how large it is but look it works! The point is, it's just a

79
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.600
thing in the world that allows us to specify points, and what we're going to do is,

80
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.600
we're going to grab these points and pop them around where we want them.

81
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.600
So we may have a Target Point there, we may have another Target Point say here,

82
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.600
and I'll just put a third Target Point down here, just for the sake of argument.

83
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.600
And all these are, for us at the moment, until we start

84
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.600
embellishing them with other properties, is a way of defining the Patrol Route.

85
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.600
Now, what we can do is we can go to this character, and we

86
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.600
can assign that character to the Target Points we

87
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.600
want him to move around. Now how do you do that? Well

88
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.600
you look for his Patrol Points array and you just start adding them. Now you can pick from

89
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.600
them, you can give them meaningful names, if you like, or you can just click on them and

90
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.600
notice what their name is. That's Point3, that's Point2, that's Point1. So I'm

91
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.600
going to imagine that this soldier wants to patrol between these three

92
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.600
points. Now of course, a given point can be shared amongst multiple soldiers,

93
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.600
one of the benefits of doing it this way. So let's go to the soldier and just

94
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600
assign these three Target Points. Then, what I'm

95
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.600
going to do is, I'm going to challenge you, when this drop-down decides to work, to add in another

96
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.600
soldier and make sure that they've got separate Target Points. And then, in the next

97
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.600
lecture, we'll start thinking about how we're actually going to read from these Target Points and iterate

98
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.600
through them in Blueprint. OK, so this dude

99
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.600
has three Target Points associated with him, and there is no currently

100
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600
no other AI Actor in the scene. Perfect! OK

101
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.600
let me give you a challenge! So what I want you to do to reinforce what we've just gone through is

102
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.600
to add another patrolling soldier. Add another AI character to your scene anywhere.

103
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.600
will do. Add a new Target Point up the stairs, and

104
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.600
then, make the two soldiers share that one point. So

105
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.600
add the point that's at the top of the stairs to the first soldier, the one I just worked on, and then,

106
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.600
for the second soldier that you're going to add, make sure that the point that's up the stairs is

107
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.600
one of them. So they're going to have different points, in general, but one of them they're going to share.

108
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600
It creates water cooler moments, where they both end up in the same place at the same time and

109
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.600
they can chat. And then, add a couple of new points for the new guy. So

110
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.600
hopefully you understand that the current guy has three points, we want to add one more for him,

111
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.600
and then, a new guy with a few points, at least two or three,

112
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.600
one of which is shared with the first guy. Hopefully that makes sense. So go ahead, pause the video, and see

113
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600
if you can get another patrolling soldier and set ourselves up for a water cooler moment

114
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.600
right now. OK welcome

115
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.600
back! So what do I mean by water cooler moment? I'm just saying that this is an opportunity,

116
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.600
as I say, for these two soldiers to interact. So there is

117
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.600
my Target Point, at the top of the stairs. I could give this one a more meaningful name,

118
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.600
I could say UpStairs. It's worth giving them

119
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.600
sensible names, quite early on. I'm going to add UpStairs to this

120
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.600
Actor's list. So there you go, UpStairs! You see how easy this is to setup

121
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.600
now? It's pretty cool, right? And then, I'm going to go ahead to the Content

122
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.600
Browser, drop in another ThirdPersonCharacter. Remember that the End

123
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.600
key on your keyboard will snap him to the ground. He has actually snapped to the ground automatically,

124
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.600
but should he be up in the air like this, I can hit the End key and push him to the ground.

125
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.600
Then, I need to give him at least the UpStairs Patrol Point,

126
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600
and then, I want to get in a few more of these Patrol

127
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.600
Points, so I'll put one perhaps here, making sure it's not under the ground.

128
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.600
I'm going to hold down the Alt key, that's one way of duplicating something in Unreal,

129
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.600
and then, drag with Alt held down and that gives me another couple

130
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.600
of Target Points. They are Target Point 4 and 5, and I'll just

131
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.600
leave them named like that, for the moment. All the time there's only a handful that is still going to be

132
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.600
manageable. So this guy now has Target Point 4

133
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.600
and Target Point 5. OK, so as we flip between the two

134
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.600
characters, you can see that this guy has these points, this guy has these points,

135
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
and now, in the next video, we can start focusing on the logic of how we make these

136
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.600
characters interact and move between these points. And you can see,

137
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.600
hopefully, this is a nice general simple way of specifying Patrol Routes.

138
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.400
So I'll see you in the next video!
