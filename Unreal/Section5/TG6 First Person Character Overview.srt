
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
OK and welcome to the First Person

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Character Overview! Notice I've changed engine versions or I will be during this video to

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,900
4.13.0, that's why it's in yellow at the top-right. And I will see you in there! Let's go and take a look!

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,900
So let's dive in and start this great project that's going to be

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,900
really using Unreal for what it was built to create, a first person shooter. So we'll

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,900
be swimming down stream, rather than up stream now. So 4.13.0

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,900
just shipped at the time of recording. You can use 4.13 anything. I'm going to

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,900
go ahead and upgrade the project now, so I'm going to open my

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,900
4.13 from here, I'm going to make sure that I have a commit, recently

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,900
with no uncommitted changes, which I do in my source control in case anything goes wrong.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,900
I'm going to open the 4.12 version of TestingGrounds, and I'm actually

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,900
going to use, as we did before, Convert in-place here

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,900
and that will actually overwrite the existing project. It's not a problem,

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,900
because it's all under source control. If we look at the source control, while it does the

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,900
upgrade, you'll see that the main thing it actually does is just write an engine association

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,900
line into the .uproject file. It may make some other

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,900
changes but that's usually all it does. So once the project's open,

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,900
I will be tagging this commit, as well,

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,900
to say that I've changed versions. That's just a convenient way of indicating

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,900
when I changed versions, but I probably won't do that until I actually commit at the end

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,900
of this video. So there you go, we're up and running in 4.13.0.

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Now, of course, it's .0, so that means things are going to go wrong! [Laughs]

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,900
We'll just live with that, for now, and as the project goes on I will upgrade through the

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,900
versions. But it will be the same for you, whatever version of 4.13 you're using.

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,900
You could do this in a more recent version than 4.13, you could use 4.14 or

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,900
whatever, but I would say that, in order to be seeing exactly

27
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,900
what I'm doing in the videos, it's easier if you just go Add Versions, pick 4.13 from the list.

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,900
It's not there yet, of course, because it's the current version, and use 4.13 point

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,900
something. Okey dokey, so that's open! Let's start

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,900
then the project, by saying what have we got? What have

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,900
we got here in this world, at the moment? So there's a lot of stuff going on for us,

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,900
and I just want to have a look at the world outliner and just see what

33
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,900
they've already put in here. They put some ArenaGeometry! If I zoom out a little bit like this,

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,900
there's a lot of walls, and these are all static mesh actors, you can see that from

35
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,900
the right-hand column, so they are literally just boxes. And then, it's also got in here

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,900
some Cubes, which they've put in, and they've got some physics on, as you can

37
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,900
see. So that's the ArenaGeometry! We then have

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,900
some lighting. There's a Light Source there of some type, we can look

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,900
over here and find out what properties it has, so you can see

40
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,900
what default Light Source you have there. We have a LightmassImportanceVolume covering the

41
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,900
entire play space, that tells the lighting system where to focus its efforts.

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,900
We have a Post Processing Volume here, which is

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,900
allowing us to do visual effects post processing. We'll leave all this in, I'm just showing you what

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,900
we've got. We have a SkyLight, so that's it under Lighting. There's some

45
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,900
RenderFX, there's a little bit of AtmosphericFog, and a SphereReflection

46
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Capture. Now, all of these things are here just to improve the

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,900
visual fidelity of the game, OK. We don't need to worry about them, we're going to leave

48
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,900
them as they are for now. We'll start exploring these types of components, as we need them, as we go through the

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,900
project. Right, now there's a FirstPersonCharacter on here, as well. Now

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,900
that FirstPersonCharacter, if I edit the blueprint and go to the full

51
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Blueprint Editor, there's actually a fair amount to this guy and I'm just going to overview it, at the moment.

52
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,900
If we have a look in the Viewport, we have a capsule collider there.

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,900
So you'll see what's happening with this first person character is, it just has arms

54
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,900
and a gun. Now the gun is pointing off in a weird direction, right now, and that's because it's controlled by

55
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,900
animation and by code. And you'll see there's a camera, roughly where his face would be,

56
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,900
and then, a capsule collider. There's a FirstPersonCameraComponent

57
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,900
here, and you can see that that has childed to it a

58
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,900
mesh, which are the arms. And this time

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,900
that mesh is a different type of mesh, and you can see it here, it is a Skeletal

60
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,900
Mesh. We'll be talking about Skeletal Meshes a lot later in the section, but Skeletal

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,900
Meshes vary from Static Meshes, because each of the vertices on

62
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,900
this mesh, each of the little dots are connected, behind the scenes, to a bone

63
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,900
that tells you how all the bones are laid out. And Skeletal Meshes

64
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,900
can actually deform and change their shape at runtime,

65
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,900
based on things called Vertex Weightings. We'll look at all that later on, this is just an overview.

66
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,900
You also have a Gun, which they've got as a separate mesh and a MuzzleLocation,

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,900
which is looking like it's in a slightly odd place there, but we'll leave it with it.

68
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,900
Let's check that the bullets actually fire properly, because that does look like a

69
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,900
strange place. By the way, these tabs, remember whenever you start a new project, you need to go to your

70
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,900
Editor settings , Appearance, Asset Editor Open Location,

71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,900
and I want the Main Window. That means when I open up new tabs, they end up docked

72
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,900
like this. For me that's my preference. So

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,900
i just want to make sure that the bullets are actually coming out of the gun in a sensible place.

74
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,900
They are, so this obviously means that, at runtime, this gun

75
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,900
moved and possibly even this MuzzleLocation all moved

76
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,900
programmatically. And then, we have a CharacterMovement component, that has a load

77
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,900
of stuff on it! Look at all the different parameters that you can change on that,

78
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,900
and this is going to be doing a lot of work for us! Now, we're going to allow ourselves to let Unreal

79
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,900
give us this big leg up, and we're in a situation here where we have a

80
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,900
prebuilt character. Now look carefully, you see the character's breathing? You see how

81
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,900
the gun and the hands are moving? There's a lot of stuff going on here!

82
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,900
We can run around, we could put some steps in. In fact, let's put some steps

83
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,900
in, right now! That can be your challenge just for this first

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,900
video, is just to look around as I just have done in this scene, and

85
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,900
also we're going to put a set of spiraled stairs in here, just on the

86
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,900
side of the block. See if you can do that, right now! Go ahead, pause the video, no

87
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,900
challenge slide for you, and just put a staircase in here.

88
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,900
If you need a hint as to where you get that from, then

89
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,900
you can go into Modes,

90
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,900
Geometry, and then you have Curved Stair or Spiral Stair.

91
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,900
So I'm just going to go

92
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,900
to Modes, Geometry, grab a Curved Stair, I'm going to rotate it around

93
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,900
by, in this case, 90 degrees, by the looks of it.

94
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Translate it, remember your keys, W,

95
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,900
E, R, etc. on your keyboard, a nice and easy way of switching between the tools.

96
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Remember that the End key will snap things to the floor, and the one way you can change this

97
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,900
is to change the Step Height in the parameters here to maybe 30. And then,

98
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,900
there we have a BSP staircase, Binary

99
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Spaced Partitoning is a way of storing this type of geometry. If we look in the

100
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,900
World Outliner you can see that we have a BSP brush. I actually have two

101
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,900
stairs, so I'm just going to get rid of the extra one. There you go!

102
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,900
Alright, so now let's just see what the character does when we encounters a slope

103
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,900
like this! He just pops up the stairs! Great! And he can jump

104
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,900
and lots of features! So have a look around, see what's already in this World Outliner,

105
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,900
make sure you're happy with how it works. Remember to

106
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,900
use, when you are adjusting geometry, things like the snapping settings up here,

107
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,900
you've got grid snapping for angles and for translation,

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,900
and just get yourself familiar with exactly what's in this environment. And

109
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,900
then, in the next video we are going to put in some third person

110
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,900
agents and give them the ability to navigate around this world. I just popped that Cube

111
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,900
back on the ground with the End key, and there you go, we're in a great starting position

112
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,900
for the project pair of stairs and we are ready to start this patrolling

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,466
behavior. See you in the next video!
