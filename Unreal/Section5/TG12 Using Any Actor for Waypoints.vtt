1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So welcome to Using Any Actor

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for Waypoints! What we're going to do in this video is get our guys,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Steve and Harry we're going to call them, moving at least to their first waypoints, there and there.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But we're also going to make it possible to specify waypoints that are not just

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
target points but include cubes, like this EditorCube21. This cube

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.266
here has now become part of Steve's patrol route. So I will see you in there!

7
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:29.266
OK, so currently these guys are running between two

8
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:33.266
predefined points, as defined in the blueprint hard coded in,

9
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:37.266
and what we want them to do is start going to at least their first waypoints. I believe

10
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:41.266
this guy goes to TargetPoint, as his first one, and this

11
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:45.266
guy over here, on the right, goes to...

12
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.266
In fact, why don't I give these guys names! I can't very call them this and this guy, let's give them some

13
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:53.266
names. So ThirdPerson, no no no let's not call him that! Let's F2,

14
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:57.266
call him Guard 1 -

15
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:01.266
Steve, and the other guy can be called Guard 2 -

16
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:05.266
Harry. OK,

17
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:09.266
[Laughs] so we've got a couple of guards in the world, Steve and Harry. So Steve is going to go

18
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:13.266
upstairs and Harry's going to go over here. O.K. so how do we arrange

19
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:17.266
that? Well let's just take a bit of a zoom out and a bit of a recap as to what all this is about,

20
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:21.266
alright. So we have this Behavior Tree, let's watch it running! If you hit play

21
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:25.266
and go to the Behavior Tree, firstly, notice that you've got to decide which Behavior Tree

22
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:29.266
you're looking at. Are you looking at Steve's AI Controller or Harry's AI

23
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:33.266
Controller? Each of them have a different brain in the world, and they're

24
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:37.266
classily named C_1 and C_0. So you can

25
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:41.266
switch between them, and then, for each one you can see where they are, what point they're currently moving to.

26
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:45.266
And at the same way, you can go to the blackboard and see what the data is for each of them

27
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:49.266
as well. In fact, you can see which guards, they are. SelfActor here is Steve and

28
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:53.266
SelfActor here is Harry. Great! Alright, so they're just patrolling

29
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:57.266
between those two points. Now what we want is, rather than these points to be hard coded

30
00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:01.266
in, we want these points to be variable, based on their array.

31
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:05.266
So actually, you're just going to delete these keys from the blackboard now bravely, both of

32
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:09.266
those, we don't need them. And we're going to create a new key, but instead of making it a vector, why don't

33
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:13.266
we just make it an object, more generally, and then, we can send the actor

34
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:17.266
not only to vector points but to the position of an object. Let's just see that that works!

35
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:21.266
So I'm just going to call it Waypoint, as simple as that,

36
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:25.266
and that's it really, that's all we have to do, it's just the waypoint that this guy is heading

37
00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:29.266
towards right now. OK, back in the Behavior Tree! What are we

38
00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:33.500
going to get them to do? I said the job was just to get them to go to their first waypoint,

39
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.533
so let's Move To, and then, with the Blackboard Key is going to need to be

40
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:41.500
Waypoint. Now, why doesn't that Blackboard Key come up? Good question, let's just

41
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.266
save and see if it does now, and if it doesn't, I'm going to close and reopen the Behavior

42
00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:49.266
Tree, because we should be able to go to Waypoint.

43
00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:53.266
If you can't, then that's because we need to specialize the Key Type. So come in here

44
00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.266
and rather than it being an Object, it can be an Actor. Object is

45
00:02:57.266 --> 00:03:01.266
just too general for us to be specifying the position of. An Object

46
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:05.266
doesn't have a position, an Actor is the most basic thing that has a position in the

47
00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:09.266
world. So get back to your Blackboard, expand out the Key Type, and make it

48
00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:13.266
an Actor! If you now go back to your Behavior Tree, you should

49
00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:17.266
be able to now say Move To Waypoint. OK,

50
00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:21.266
so it's important that it's not just an object but it's an actor. So now that we've made the

51
00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:25.266
actual Blackboard item, more generally, an Actor

52
00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:29.266
rather than necessarily a particular vector, let's go look at the Third

53
00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:33.266
PersonCharacter blueprint. Remember we made an array of patrol points.

54
00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:37.266
Well these can be made, rather than target points,

55
00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:41.266
they could also just be made to be actors. Now, you may

56
00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:45.266
fear you'll lose your data, in this case, you actually won't lose your data. The reason

57
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:49.266
why you don't lose your settings... Firstly, let's just check we haven't lost our settings.

58
00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:53.266
If we click on Steve here and look at his Patrol Points, you'll see they're still

59
00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:57.266
there, but now, we can actually select not only Target

60
00:03:57.266 --> 00:04:01.266
Points but any actor, which is more general and more powerful. Now the reason we don't

61
00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:05.266
lose the existing Control Points is, if you look at the Class

62
00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:09.266
Viewer and you look at what a Target Point is. It is an

63
00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:13.266
Actor, so going from a Target Point up to an Actor is absolutely fine, because

64
00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:17.266
it's of the same type. Target Point inherits from Actor.

65
00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:21.266
OK cool! So now what we can do is just

66
00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:25.266
another handy little thing I want to show you here! If we were to click on say Steve,

67
00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:29.266
click the little lock symbol in the Details Panel there. And what that'll do is,

68
00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:33.266
when I select other objects now it'll still be Steve's details that show.

69
00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:37.266
Now, what I can do is, imagine I wanted him to patrol to this cube and I don't necessarily

70
00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:41.266
want to have to put another target point in the scene. Generally, by the way, it's probably a better

71
00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:45.266
bet just to put another target point in the scene. Why? Because it decouples

72
00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:49.266
the idea of where this guy's navigating from where these things are. Imagine you or a level

73
00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:53.266
designer come along later and move the cube, you may or may not want the

74
00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:57.266
guard to go with it, so you need to just discuss with everybody involved.

75
00:04:57.266 --> 00:05:01.266
But let's just imagine that we do want his waypoint to track any future

76
00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:05.266
movements of that cube. Then, this little trick of having him selected, selecting the cube,

77
00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:09.266
clicking +, and then, saying Use Select, at the

78
00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:13.266
top there, will add this cube to

79
00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:17.266
the mix. So we'll do that just for fun! So we've made things more general.

80
00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:21.266
Now, what we want these guys to do is go to their first waypoint. So where

81
00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:25.266
do we even set that up? Well this is asset binding, isn't it?

82
00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:29.266
Remember whenever we want to soft reference things we use Blueprint. Who's blueprint?

83
00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:33.266
Who's job is it to pick the piece of paper out of this actor's pocket, this Third

84
00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:37.266
PersonCharacter's pocket, and read it? That's my question for you.

85
00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:41.266
Is it the job of the ThirdPersonCharacter, or is it the job of the

86
00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:45.266
AI Controller, when he turns up on the character and possesses it?

87
00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:49.266
Well I would say it's the job of the AI Controller! When he

88
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:53.266
walks up and takes control of this character, it's his job to take the piece

89
00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:57.266
of paper out of the pocket and start setting these Blackboard values. So we're going to no longer

90
00:05:57.266 --> 00:06:01.266
set these Blackboard keys hard like this, and we're just going to do a bit of top

91
00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:05.266
down programming. Sure we're going to use a Blackboard and at the end of the day, we're going to run a

92
00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:09.266
Behavior Tree, but in between what are we going to do? Well I'm going to put a comment block here,

93
00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:13.266
and I'm going to say, we are going to "Find

94
00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:17.266
Patrol Route", basically. That's what we need to do in the middle.

95
00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:21.266
So our job now is to work out how we're going to find the Patrol Route,

96
00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:25.266
and at least for now, we're going to find the very first element of that

97
00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:29.266
Patrol Route. So I'm going to get rid of the tick, and I'm going to start

98
00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:33.266
on that and then challenge you to finish it. So we're going to get the Controlled

99
00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:37.266
Pawn, this is the first thing. So the AI Controller has

100
00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:41.266
possessed the Pawn, we need to get it. Now, from that, can we get the Patrol Points?

101
00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:45.266
Well no we can't, because Pawns, in general, don't have Patrol Points, but the

102
00:06:45.266 --> 00:06:49.266
ThirdPersonCharacter that we've created does. So we do need to do a cast to a

103
00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:53.266
ThirdPersonCharacter. Is that nice? It's not great but it's OK. It's

104
00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:57.266
OK because basically, the AI Controller only really works with a ThirdPersonController

105
00:06:57.266 --> 00:07:01.266
anyway. We already have a tight coupling in there. So once we have a

106
00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:05.266
ThirdPersonCharacter, we can now go get the Patrol Route

107
00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:09.266
OK or the Patrol Point, and that is an array of, now, Actors

108
00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:13.266
or Actor references. It used to be an

109
00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:17.266
array of Target Points, but we've made that more general. Now what

110
00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:21.266
I want you to do, at least for now, is to find

111
00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:25.266
"First Element

112
00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:29.266
only For Now". What I want you to do in here then,

113
00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:33.266
is... Let's be consistent on the capitalization. ...is to

114
00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:37.266
get this array, find just the first element of it, set the irrelevant

115
00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:41.266
key on the Blackboard,  you've got the Blackboard here. Set

116
00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:45.266
that Waypoint Key, and then, see if both of our players will actually go

117
00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:49.266
to their first Waypoints.

118
00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:53.266
OK welcome back! So let's get

119
00:07:53.266 --> 00:07:57.266
this done! We will extract this behavior out into a function, in a little bit, but for

120
00:07:57.266 --> 00:08:01.266
now, let's just get it working. So you come off of the Patrol Points Array; under

121
00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:05.266
Utilities in Array, you have a Get. Now, you might be asking

122
00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:09.266
why we're doing this in Blueprint rather than in C++. Just for simplicity, for now, we will

123
00:08:09.266 --> 00:08:13.266
decide when we finish refactoring in Blueprint if it's worth moving it to C++.

124
00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:17.266
So here is element 0 and it is an Actor. So the next thing we're going to need

125
00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:21.266
is the Blackboard, and then, we're going to need to Set Value

126
00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:25.266
as Object. Remember we're using objects now. So the execution

127
00:08:25.266 --> 00:08:29.266
flow comes through, we have BeginPlay, use Blackboard, we find

128
00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:33.266
the Blackboard. We need to decide on what key, so let's generate the key

129
00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:37.266
name now. The name, literally, is going to be Waypoint,

130
00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:41.266
but I'm not going to type it, I'm going to copy and paste it with any string referencing.

131
00:08:41.266 --> 00:08:45.266
And then it says, well OK that's very well, what do you want

132
00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:49.266
to set my Waypoint Key to?

133
00:08:49.266 --> 00:08:53.266
Well I want to set it to the value of the first Patrol Point.

134
00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:57.266
OK that's cool! Now comes the question, when are

135
00:08:57.266 --> 00:09:01.266
we going to even cast to ThirdPersonCharacter? It's all very well having that

136
00:09:01.266 --> 00:09:05.266
there, but there's no execution flow, so I think that we need to do that before

137
00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:09.266
we try and set the value. So I'm moving everything across to the right, I'm going to bring execution

138
00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:13.266
flow into here, and then from here, assuming the class succeeds all the way

139
00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:17.266
up there. We could bring that up, leave it down, it doesn't really matter. We're going to extract some of this into a

140
00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:21.266
function, in a minute, as soon as we know it works. And then, once that's

141
00:09:21.266 --> 00:09:25.266
done, we just go ahead and run the Behavior Tree! So that is my code, the

142
00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:29.266
Blueprint code that I've added in there. Let's go ahead and see if it works! Do both of these

143
00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:33.266
guys go to their first point? Ah hah, they do! There's Harry there going

144
00:09:33.266 --> 00:09:37.266
to his point and Steve at the top of the stairs. That's fantastic! So well done if you

145
00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:42.433
got that far! What I think I'm going to do now is just take all of this stuff here,

146
00:09:42.433 --> 00:09:45.266
including the Get Controlled Pawn, everything apart from

147
00:09:45.266 --> 00:09:49.266
this Blackboard, actually, so all of this, but not get Blackboard. The way I'm

148
00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:53.266
unselecting get Blackboard is by holding the Control Key down, and all of this, we

149
00:09:53.266 --> 00:09:57.266
can say Collapse to Function. And we can name that function, look on the left-hand

150
00:09:57.266 --> 00:10:01.266
side, it's waiting, it's going to be Find Patrol

151
00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:05.266
Route. We don't need the comment anymore, because that was our

152
00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:09.266
way of doing top down coding in Blueprint. You drag that across, tighten

153
00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:13.266
it all up, and then, look how tight and tidy the blueprint is. I'll even close the Details Tab so

154
00:10:13.266 --> 00:10:17.266
you can see it. On BeginPlay we use the Blackboard, find a Patrol Route, and run

155
00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:21.266
the Behavior Tree. [Laughs] Very simple! OK there's some hidden complexity in here,

156
00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:25.266
under Find Patrol Route, so let's go tidy that up a little bit. That one's still

157
00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:29.266
looks nice and simple as well. So when we start Find Patrol Route,

158
00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:33.266
we go ahead, we get the Control Pawn that the AI's controlling down

159
00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:37.266
here, we pull off the list of Patrol Points,

160
00:10:37.266 --> 00:10:41.266
we get index 0, later we'll iterate through them,

161
00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:45.266
and if I bring these two down I can prevent any... Oops, I can

162
00:10:45.266 --> 00:10:49.266
prevent any crosses, if I can get it right, I can bring those down,

163
00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:53.266
I can put the literal name in here, bring these guys back up,

164
00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:57.266
and I can keep it nice and tidy, I don't have to go absolutely mad,

165
00:10:57.266 --> 00:11:01.266
and then, it's relatively clear what this is doing. It gets the Control Point,

166
00:11:01.266 --> 00:11:05.266
Pawn cast to a ThirdPersonCharacter. Notice this line here, this Selft 2 line.

167
00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:09.266
Firstly, it shouldn't be called Self 2, so let's rename that here. How do we

168
00:11:09.266 --> 00:11:13.266
rename it? Well we're going to need the Details Panel back, and we can either

169
00:11:13.266 --> 00:11:17.266
do it here, at this level, or we could zoom out to the other level. And instead of Self 2,

170
00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:21.266
we're asking the question, what is this? Let's go up a level! What is

171
00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:25.266
Self 2? It's Blackboard! So I will rename it here because it's easier. Click on it

172
00:11:25.266 --> 00:11:29.266
and rename it Blackboard.

173
00:11:29.266 --> 00:11:33.266
So if we look back in here, what do we have coming in? We have a Blackboard object coming

174
00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:37.266
in. Now, I don't like the way these are crossed

175
00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:41.266
over, so I'm going to lift that up so I can see that these are separate objects. And if you don't

176
00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:45.266
like things crossing, you can go nuts and start doing all this sort of stuff, but some

177
00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:49.266
way, you're going to end up with a cross if you're not careful. So I wouldn't worry about it too

178
00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:53.266
much, but certainly, don't obfuscate the fact that two lines are doing different

179
00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:57.266
things. So perhaps the best way to lay this out is something like this! That cross doesn't

180
00:11:57.266 --> 00:12:01.266
really matter, at least the two blue lines don't get confused, and then, we can bring all

181
00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:05.266
this stuff sort of up here and whatever.

182
00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:09.266
At this point, you can go mad on the blueprints here! You can start putting

183
00:12:09.266 --> 00:12:13.266
reroute nodes in, by the way, if you want to, but I think that that

184
00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:17.266
might be going too far. If you want to do that, you right-click, Add

185
00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:21.266
Reroute Node, and you can use that

186
00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:25.266
Reroute Node to pass execution flow through. I don't like them, because they

187
00:12:25.266 --> 00:12:29.266
make it a little bit harder to adjust the blueprint later, but it can tidy things up, if you're worried about

188
00:12:29.266 --> 00:12:33.266
how they look. So that's the detail in there, we zoom up to the bigger level, you've

189
00:12:33.266 --> 00:12:37.266
got this, and hopefully it's clear what's going on there. I'm just going to compile, play,

190
00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:41.266
make sure they go to their initial Patrol Routes, and we are done!

191
00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:42.632
