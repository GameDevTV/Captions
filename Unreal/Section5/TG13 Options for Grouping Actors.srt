Hi! Welcome to Options for Grouping Actors!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video we're simply going to be discussing all the different ways that we could group actors together.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
including layers and groups and tags and empty actors and folders.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.033
etc. And then. we will be picking a scheme and discussing it with other students and cracking on!

5
00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:22.033
So just before we get these NPC's actually iterating through

6
00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:26.033
a list of possible patrol points. let's just discuss in general

7
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:30.033
different ways that we could actually group things together. This is a very general discussion

8
00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:34.033
about how do you group actors. that are semantically related.

9
00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:38.033
So the point is. there is no correct answer in a given situation. but what is

10
00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:42.033
quite important is you've got some idea of the options that are available to you and

11
00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:46.033
that you are able to choose between them. sensibly. You're nearly always making a comprimise in

12
00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:50.033
an engineering situation like this. but we want you to make one that you and everybody else you're

13
00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:54.033
working with understands. So let's start and take a look at a few things! I'm just going to play

14
00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:58.033
around here and have a look! So one thing we've got is layers! So if I

15
00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:02.033
multi-select say a few of these cubes. say maybe all three of these cubes

16
00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:06.033
here. these EditorCubes are then multi-selected. I use the Control Key to do that.

17
00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:10.033
One thing we can look at is layers. So we have to go to Window

18
00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:14.033
and then Layers. and that'll bring up this funny little panel here.

19
00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:18.033
And then. what we can do is right-click in there and then say. Add Selected Actors to a New

20
00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:22.033
Layer. and we could just call this Cube Stack. for example.

21
00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:26.033
That should be one way. And if I turn that off you can't see them. and if you turn them on you can see them!

22
00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:30.033
We could add all Cubes to another layer. including those Cubes. so

23
00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:34.033
we could say these three. In fact. it would be easier if I just did this

24
00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:38.033
one in the Hierarchy. so let's just grab them all. And do have a play with this. as you listen to me. Now. all

25
00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:42.033
Cubes are selected. and I could Add Selected Actors to a New Layer and

26
00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:46.033
say All Cubes. So one thing about using layers is

27
00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:50.033
that a particular

28
00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:54.033
object. like this stack of three cubes. can be in more than one layer. So we can turn off

29
00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:58.033
All Cubes or we can turn off the Cube Stack. but the only way that this layer.

30
00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:02.033
that these cubes. will disappear is if they're turned off in both situations. If they appear

31
00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:06.033
in any layer. then they will appear in your level. Layers are normally used for visibility. For

32
00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:10.033
example. if you have a building with multiple levels on it. as in floors. then you may

33
00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:14.033
want to turn off floors that you're not working on for simplicity. when it comes to visability.

34
00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.033
You could also say use it for cover. we could turn off All Cubes if we're working on level

35
00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:22.033
geometry that didn't include these cubes for cover. etc. So it's one way of grouping things.

36
00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:26.033
I'd suggest you mainly use it for visibility. as that's what it's designed for. You can kind of

37
00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:30.033
see that inherent here. in the way that there's a little eye. You can also click

38
00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:34.033
See Contents in the Layers window. that that will show you the contents. I'm

39
00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:38.033
going to Delete all of these Layers. Don't delete the actors. Delete the

40
00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:42.033
Layers themselves. if you delete them. Delete Layer there. right-click Delete Layer. and I'm going to

41
00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:46.033
close the window. So layers. that's one option. mainly for visibility. it is a possablity for grouping

42
00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:50.033
things together. You could query for those but I would stick with it for simplicity

43
00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:54.033
and visibility. Alright. so groups. what are groups? Well let's have a look!

44
00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:58.033
If we multi-select something in the World Outliner and right-click. we have this

45
00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:02.033
strange Group option. If I hit Group like that. let's see what it's done.

46
00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:06.033
It's made this thing called a GroupActor here. in the Hierarchy. and it's

47
00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:10.033
a kind of weird thing. If I click on any of the TargetPoints and they all end up selected. but the Group

48
00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:14.033
Actor doesn't. and if I click on GroupActor. then everything including

49
00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:18.033
the GroupActor gets selected. So really. a group is just a way of

50
00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:22.033
rapidly multi-selecting things. and I don't really like that. I think that's a bit

51
00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:26.033
confusing. There's not hierarchical aspect to it. it's a bit asymmetric the way that I

52
00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:30.033
click on TargetPoint and GroupActor doesn't come up and vice versa. But there may be some situations

53
00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:34.033
in which you want to use this for rapid multi-selection of things.

54
00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:38.033
So I'm gong to Delete the Group. You need to do that a little bit carefully. you need to

55
00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:42.033
Ungroup first. and then. well then the group disappears and you're done!

56
00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:46.033
Alright. so tags! How about tags? Well tags can be pretty cool! So if we

57
00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:50.033
multi-select the TargetPoint and look down at tags. then we could just add

58
00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:54.033
arbitrary tags. Now a given thing could have multiple tags. so we could say patrol

59
00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:58.033
and then all of these TargetPoints would have a patrol tag on

60
00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:02.033
them. And you can have multiple tags on a given object. very handy. a bit

61
00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:06.033
like the way Google Docs works. you can have multiple folder labels

62
00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:10.033
effectively on a given file. Advantages. well one thing can have

63
00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:14.033
multiple tags. it's nice and flexible and simple. it's unobtrusive.

64
00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:18.033
it's relatively fast to find things by the tags. but the problem is. you've got to

65
00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:22.033
remember to add them and it's quite easy to forget to add tags. Just like the problem with Google

66
00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:26.033
Drive is that you can forget to assign things to folders. if you're going to be cleaver and

67
00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:30.033
try and have two definite hierarchies running. So I'd prefer a hierarchy that's simple to

68
00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:34.033
conceive. but tags can be useful. I don't think I want to use tags in this situation. but be

69
00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:38.033
aware that they're there. they can be queried in Blueprint. they can be queried in C++.

70
00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:42.033
and they're pretty cool! So that's tags. now

71
00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:46.033
a parent empty actor! So here's another thing we can do with these Target Points. we could say well we've got all these Target Points.

72
00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:50.033
why don't we put an empty actor in the world? It doesn't really matter where. and then. back in the

73
00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:54.033
World Outliner we grab all the TargetPoints and pop them under the empty

74
00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:58.033
Actor. if Provided I can find it. There it is! And I can give this guy a name. I can say

75
00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:02.033
Patrol Route 1. and that's pretty cool!

76
00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:06.033
When you ever add another PatrolPoint it's fairly obvious that you'll

77
00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:10.033
want to be sticking under this Patrol Route. You can iterate through children

78
00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:14.033
of this Patrol Route Actor. to find all of its TargetPoints. Pretty handy!

79
00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:18.766
It's a bit weird if we want to add say a cube as one of control routes. because then

80
00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:22.033
where do we put the cube? Does it go in this folder. because this is organizing by folders.

81
00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:26.033
which is. of course. another way that you could do things. You could use empty actors.

82
00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:30.033
which has a consequence that if you move the parent actor then all the

83
00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:34.033
children move. and perhaps that's the best reason to use an empty actor. I'm not sure that you'd

84
00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:38.033
want to do that here. Why would we move the Patrol Route around.

85
00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:42.033
as a whole? You know. its shape really does depend on what's in the level.

86
00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:46.033
so I think it's not really appropriate. but one of the consequences

87
00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:50.033
of using a parent actor is that you can move the parent and all the children go with it.

88
00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:54.033
So I'm just going to move these out. get

89
00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:58.033
rid of the parent actor.

90
00:05:58.033 --> 00:06:02.033
So to create a folder. you just to the top-right here of the World Outliner. and that just literally

91
00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:06.033
makes a folder. which just groups things from that stand point. It's literally

92
00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:10.033
a way of organizing your hierarchy. so they have no impact on how anything is actually working.

93
00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:14.033
it's just an organizational tool. They can be handy as well! In fact. straight away.

94
00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:18.033
all these TargetPoints should at least be in a folder. So I'm going to do that. Target

95
00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:22.033
Points.

96
00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:26.033
and there we go! Now. why has the SkySphere ended up under the TargetPoints? If I undo with

97
00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:30.033
Control Z. it's just because it was selected. If you have something selected before

98
00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:34.033
you create a folder. then you are going to put those things in that folder

99
00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:38.033
straight away. So why not select all the TargetPoints and then call this

100
00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:42.033
Patrol Route. And there is a folder of them or Patrol

101
00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:46.033
Routes or TargetPoints is more descriptive.

102
00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:50.033
OK. so I could put all my TargetPoints neatly there and then collapse all this stuff

103
00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:54.033
down. Simple. folders. telling you how to use folders! So what else could we do?

104
00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:58.033
We could group on the GameObject. which is what we are already doing. On the ThirdPerson

105
00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:02.033
Character here we have an array of PatrolPoints. and they are

106
00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:06.033
now. rather than being just TargetPoints they are actors in general.

107
00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:10.033
which means that we can put into that array whatever we want. We can put TargetPoints. we

108
00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:14.033
could put stairs. we could put cubes. we can put any actor. we can even put another

109
00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:18.033
actor. like a player. One of the patrol points could be chasing the player. it'd be a bit weird but you could

110
00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:22.033
do it. So loads of options! Let's just recap what we've done! We've talked about layers

111
00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:26.033
that you access through Windows and Layers. You could use Groups. which is

112
00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:30.033
just a clicking tool inside the World Outliner here.

113
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:34.033
You could use tags. nice and flexible. easy to forget to add them. You could use a parent

114
00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:38.033
empty actor. particularly useful if you think you're going to be moving all the children wholesale.

115
00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:42.033
together. then the way the transforms work will mean that's easy.

116
00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:46.033
You can use a folder and we're going to use a combination of a

117
00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:50.033
folder and then also just grouping on

118
00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:54.033
the actor. because a given actor may want to share some of these TargetPoints.

119
00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:58.033
so that makes life easy to conceive about. And you can use. not just

120
00:07:58.033 --> 00:08:02.033
TargetPoints but other actors as well. So what I want you to do is to just explain a

121
00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:06.033
grouping choice. Pick a grouping choice for the patrol points yourself.

122
00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:10.033
Don't worry about what we're already doing or what I've decided I'm going to use. I just want you to

123
00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:14.033
argue for a particular grouping choice. I'm going to go ahead and do it the way that I'm doing it.

124
00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:18.033
but I want you to just get used to discussing it with other people. this is

125
00:08:18.033 --> 00:08:22.033
really helpful to open the discussions. So click on Lecture Discussions in the Resources.

126
00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:26.033
share your thoughts with others about how you may group these things. or you're

127
00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:30.033
welcome. at this stage. to open the discussion wider and talk about how you may

128
00:08:30.033 --> 00:08:34.033
group things like projectiles from a previous project or whatever. Let's just have a discussion

129
00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:38.033
about grouping in the discussions. And.

130
00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:42.033
as I said. I'll pick one and carry on with that. and the purpose of this is purely to think about different grouping

131
00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:46.033
choices. the pros and cons. and also perhaps you can think of some other ways of grouping

132
00:08:46.033 --> 00:08:50.033
actors. that may be useful to you. So go ahead. pause the video.

133
00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:54.033
discuss grouping with your peers. and I will see you in the next video. when I

134
00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:57.166
will carry on with my choice!

=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi! Welcome to Options for Grouping Actors!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video we're simply going to be discussing all the different ways that we could group actors together,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
including layers and groups and tags and empty actors and folders,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,033
etc. And then, we will be picking a scheme and discussing it with other students and cracking on!

5
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:22,033
So just before we get these NPC's actually iterating through

6
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:26,033
a list of possible patrol points, let's just discuss in general

7
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:30,033
different ways that we could actually group things together. This is a very general discussion

8
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:34,033
about how do you group actors, that are semantically related.

9
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:38,033
So the point is, there is no correct answer in a given situation, but what is

10
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:42,033
quite important is you've got some idea of the options that are available to you and

11
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:46,033
that you are able to choose between them, sensibly. You're nearly always making a comprimise in

12
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:50,033
an engineering situation like this, but we want you to make one that you and everybody else you're

13
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:54,033
working with understands. So let's start and take a look at a few things! I'm just going to play

14
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:58,033
around here and have a look! So one thing we've got is layers! So if I

15
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:02,033
multi-select say a few of these cubes, say maybe all three of these cubes

16
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:06,033
here, these EditorCubes are then multi-selected. I use the Control Key to do that.

17
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:10,033
One thing we can look at is layers. So we have to go to Window

18
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:14,033
and then Layers, and that'll bring up this funny little panel here.

19
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:18,033
And then, what we can do is right-click in there and then say, Add Selected Actors to a New

20
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:22,033
Layer, and we could just call this Cube Stack, for example.

21
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:26,033
That should be one way. And if I turn that off you can't see them, and if you turn them on you can see them!

22
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:30,033
We could add all Cubes to another layer, including those Cubes, so

23
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:34,033
we could say these three. In fact, it would be easier if I just did this

24
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:38,033
one in the Hierarchy, so let's just grab them all. And do have a play with this, as you listen to me. Now, all

25
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:42,033
Cubes are selected, and I could Add Selected Actors to a New Layer and

26
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:46,033
say All Cubes. So one thing about using layers is

27
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:50,033
that a particular

28
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:54,033
object, like this stack of three cubes, can be in more than one layer. So we can turn off

29
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:58,033
All Cubes or we can turn off the Cube Stack, but the only way that this layer,

30
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:02,033
that these cubes, will disappear is if they're turned off in both situations. If they appear

31
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:06,033
in any layer, then they will appear in your level. Layers are normally used for visibility. For

32
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:10,033
example, if you have a building with multiple levels on it, as in floors, then you may

33
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:14,033
want to turn off floors that you're not working on for simplicity, when it comes to visability.

34
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,033
You could also say use it for cover, we could turn off All Cubes if we're working on level

35
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:22,033
geometry that didn't include these cubes for cover, etc. So it's one way of grouping things,

36
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:26,033
I'd suggest you mainly use it for visibility, as that's what it's designed for. You can kind of

37
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:30,033
see that inherent here, in the way that there's a little eye. You can also click

38
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:34,033
See Contents in the Layers window, that that will show you the contents. I'm

39
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:38,033
going to Delete all of these Layers. Don't delete the actors, Delete the

40
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:42,033
Layers themselves, if you delete them. Delete Layer there, right-click Delete Layer, and I'm going to

41
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:46,033
close the window. So layers, that's one option, mainly for visibility, it is a possablity for grouping

42
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:50,033
things together. You could query for those but I would stick with it for simplicity

43
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:54,033
and visibility. Alright, so groups, what are groups? Well let's have a look!

44
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:58,033
If we multi-select something in the World Outliner and right-click, we have this

45
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:02,033
strange Group option. If I hit Group like that, let's see what it's done.

46
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:06,033
It's made this thing called a GroupActor here, in the Hierarchy, and it's

47
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:10,033
a kind of weird thing. If I click on any of the TargetPoints and they all end up selected, but the Group

48
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:14,033
Actor doesn't, and if I click on GroupActor, then everything including

49
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:18,033
the GroupActor gets selected. So really, a group is just a way of

50
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:22,033
rapidly multi-selecting things, and I don't really like that, I think that's a bit

51
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:26,033
confusing. There's not hierarchical aspect to it, it's a bit asymmetric the way that I

52
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:30,033
click on TargetPoint and GroupActor doesn't come up and vice versa. But there may be some situations

53
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:34,033
in which you want to use this for rapid multi-selection of things.

54
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:38,033
So I'm gong to Delete the Group. You need to do that a little bit carefully, you need to

55
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:42,033
Ungroup first, and then, well then the group disappears and you're done!

56
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:46,033
Alright, so tags! How about tags? Well tags can be pretty cool! So if we

57
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:50,033
multi-select the TargetPoint and look down at tags, then we could just add

58
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:54,033
arbitrary tags. Now a given thing could have multiple tags, so we could say patrol

59
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:58,033
and then all of these TargetPoints would have a patrol tag on

60
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:02,033
them. And you can have multiple tags on a given object, very handy, a bit

61
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:06,033
like the way Google Docs works, you can have multiple folder labels

62
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:10,033
effectively on a given file. Advantages, well one thing can have

63
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:14,033
multiple tags, it's nice and flexible and simple, it's unobtrusive,

64
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:18,033
it's relatively fast to find things by the tags, but the problem is, you've got to

65
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:22,033
remember to add them and it's quite easy to forget to add tags. Just like the problem with Google

66
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:26,033
Drive is that you can forget to assign things to folders, if you're going to be cleaver and

67
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:30,033
try and have two definite hierarchies running. So I'd prefer a hierarchy that's simple to

68
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:34,033
conceive, but tags can be useful. I don't think I want to use tags in this situation, but be

69
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:38,033
aware that they're there, they can be queried in Blueprint, they can be queried in C++,

70
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:42,033
and they're pretty cool! So that's tags, now

71
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:46,033
a parent empty actor! So here's another thing we can do with these Target Points, we could say well we've got all these Target Points,

72
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:50,033
why don't we put an empty actor in the world? It doesn't really matter where, and then, back in the

73
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:54,033
World Outliner we grab all the TargetPoints and pop them under the empty

74
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:58,033
Actor, if Provided I can find it. There it is! And I can give this guy a name, I can say

75
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:02,033
Patrol Route 1, and that's pretty cool!

76
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:06,033
When you ever add another PatrolPoint it's fairly obvious that you'll

77
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:10,033
want to be sticking under this Patrol Route. You can iterate through children

78
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:14,033
of this Patrol Route Actor, to find all of its TargetPoints. Pretty handy!

79
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:18,766
It's a bit weird if we want to add say a cube as one of control routes, because then

80
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:22,033
where do we put the cube? Does it go in this folder, because this is organizing by folders,

81
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:26,033
which is, of course, another way that you could do things. You could use empty actors,

82
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:30,033
which has a consequence that if you move the parent actor then all the

83
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:34,033
children move, and perhaps that's the best reason to use an empty actor. I'm not sure that you'd

84
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:38,033
want to do that here. Why would we move the Patrol Route around,

85
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:42,033
as a whole? You know, its shape really does depend on what's in the level,

86
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:46,033
so I think it's not really appropriate, but one of the consequences

87
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:50,033
of using a parent actor is that you can move the parent and all the children go with it.

88
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:54,033
So I'm just going to move these out, get

89
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:58,033
rid of the parent actor.

90
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:02,033
So to create a folder, you just to the top-right here of the World Outliner, and that just literally

91
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:06,033
makes a folder, which just groups things from that stand point. It's literally

92
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:10,033
a way of organizing your hierarchy, so they have no impact on how anything is actually working,

93
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:14,033
it's just an organizational tool. They can be handy as well! In fact, straight away,

94
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:18,033
all these TargetPoints should at least be in a folder. So I'm going to do that, Target

95
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:22,033
Points,

96
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:26,033
and there we go! Now, why has the SkySphere ended up under the TargetPoints? If I undo with

97
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:30,033
Control Z, it's just because it was selected. If you have something selected before

98
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:34,033
you create a folder, then you are going to put those things in that folder

99
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:38,033
straight away. So why not select all the TargetPoints and then call this

100
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:42,033
Patrol Route. And there is a folder of them or Patrol

101
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:46,033
Routes or TargetPoints is more descriptive.

102
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:50,033
OK, so I could put all my TargetPoints neatly there and then collapse all this stuff

103
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:54,033
down. Simple, folders, telling you how to use folders! So what else could we do?

104
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:58,033
We could group on the GameObject, which is what we are already doing. On the ThirdPerson

105
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:02,033
Character here we have an array of PatrolPoints, and they are

106
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:06,033
now, rather than being just TargetPoints they are actors in general,

107
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:10,033
which means that we can put into that array whatever we want. We can put TargetPoints, we

108
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:14,033
could put stairs, we could put cubes, we can put any actor, we can even put another

109
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:18,033
actor, like a player. One of the patrol points could be chasing the player, it'd be a bit weird but you could

110
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:22,033
do it. So loads of options! Let's just recap what we've done! We've talked about layers

111
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:26,033
that you access through Windows and Layers. You could use Groups, which is

112
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:30,033
just a clicking tool inside the World Outliner here.

113
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,033
You could use tags, nice and flexible, easy to forget to add them. You could use a parent

114
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:38,033
empty actor, particularly useful if you think you're going to be moving all the children wholesale,

115
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:42,033
together, then the way the transforms work will mean that's easy.

116
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:46,033
You can use a folder and we're going to use a combination of a

117
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,033
folder and then also just grouping on

118
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:54,033
the actor, because a given actor may want to share some of these TargetPoints,

119
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:58,033
so that makes life easy to conceive about. And you can use, not just

120
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:02,033
TargetPoints but other actors as well. So what I want you to do is to just explain a

121
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:06,033
grouping choice. Pick a grouping choice for the patrol points yourself.

122
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:10,033
Don't worry about what we're already doing or what I've decided I'm going to use, I just want you to

123
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:14,033
argue for a particular grouping choice. I'm going to go ahead and do it the way that I'm doing it,

124
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:18,033
but I want you to just get used to discussing it with other people, this is

125
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:22,033
really helpful to open the discussions. So click on Lecture Discussions in the Resources,

126
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:26,033
share your thoughts with others about how you may group these things, or you're

127
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:30,033
welcome, at this stage, to open the discussion wider and talk about how you may

128
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:34,033
group things like projectiles from a previous project or whatever. Let's just have a discussion

129
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:38,033
about grouping in the discussions. And,

130
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:42,033
as I said, I'll pick one and carry on with that, and the purpose of this is purely to think about different grouping

131
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:46,033
choices, the pros and cons, and also perhaps you can think of some other ways of grouping

132
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:50,033
actors, that may be useful to you. So go ahead, pause the video,

133
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:54,033
discuss grouping with your peers, and I will see you in the next video, when I

134
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,166
will carry on with my choice!
