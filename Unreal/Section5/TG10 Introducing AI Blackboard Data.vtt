00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So in this video

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we're going to be Introducing AI Blackboard Data, and we're going to use that data

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to specify two patrol points like this, that the AI Controller will be

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
moving between. You see him running between the world origin, at my cursor, and some other point

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
in the map. And while he's doing all that, the Behavior Tree now

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
will be doing something slightly more interesting, using a sequence node and moving between these

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
two different points, that are specified in two pieces of Blackboard data.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And of course, there's some blueprint that goes along with that. So I will see you in there!

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.266


10
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:36.266
So now that we're had a brief look at Behavior Trees, which are like the methods

11
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:40.266
of your code, they are the behavior or the

12
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:44.266
execution flow of how the artificial intelligence is going to work.

13
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:48.266
Let's take a little bit more of a look at the blackboards! So you may have a Self

14
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:52.266
Actor key that's added itself here, probably just because the Behavior Tree's

15
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:56.266
Move To wants something to move to. So I'm going to add a new

16
00:00:56.266 --> 00:01:00.266
key and make it a VectorKey, because that's the sensible thing

17
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:04.266
to use if we're wanting to specify a position in the world. I'm going to call it

18
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:08.266
WorldOrigin. And this is just

19
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:12.266
the 0,0,0 point. So that's

20
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:16.266
how I make a vector! Now, this is not obviously setting the value, this is

21
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:20.266
just a description, this is just a hover over description

22
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:24.266
for it. So now we need to talk about how we're going to set the value. So back in the

23
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:28.266
Behavior Tree, instead of moving to this SelfActor thing, we're going to move to this new WorldOrigin

24
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.266
key. I'm actually going to delete the SelfActor key, so we're just

25
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:36.266
left with a vector key, a yellow vector key, called WorldOrigin

26
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:40.266
and Move To uses that. Now, how do we set the value?

27
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:44.266
Well you actually set the value inside the blueprint, so let's go to the

28
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:48.266
NPC_AI_BP blueprint here, and I'm going to set this value before we run the

29
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:52.266
Behavior Tree. It kind of makes sense to do that, because we want the data

30
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:56.266
available before we try and run the behavior. So what I'm going to is I'm going to say Use

31
00:01:56.266 --> 00:02:00.266
Blackboard, which is a new type of blueprint node,

32
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:04.266
and I'm going to do that straight after BeginPlay, I'm going to specify the Blackboard as

33
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:08.266
the patrol data. OK that's cool! Now, I'm going to give myself

34
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:12.266
some more room and just show you how to do this, and then, there's going to be a nice exercise where you get to rehearse this yourself.

35
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:16.266
So we're going to use the patrol data Blackboard. Now we've got a reference

36
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:20.266
to the Blackboard component here, and with that we can Set Value

37
00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:24.266
as Vector. This is how we set these

38
00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:28.266
Blackboard values. So I'm going to do that and then I'll wire up the execution.

39
00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:32.266
So how do we set the value? Well it's string referenced, or more specifically

40
00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:36.266
it's name reference, which is an f name, which is something called a hash

41
00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:40.266
of a string, but to all intents and purposes it's referenced by string. The way

42
00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:44.266
we're going to use it is go and grab the actual string name of

43
00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:48.266
this WorldOrigin. I don't like referencing things by string like this but it's how it's done.

44
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:52.266
So the good practice is to copy and paste the word WorldOrigin,

45
00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:56.266
and then, in the blueprint we make, by dragging backwards off the key name,

46
00:02:56.266 --> 00:03:00.266
we make a new name make literal name and just paste it right

47
00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:04.266
in there. So the game begins, we tell it what Blackboard

48
00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:08.266
to use, we set a value as a vector. Well which value? Which key? Which

49
00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:12.266
of the Blackboard keys? Well there's only one right now and it's called WorldOrigin. So you set it by

50
00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:16.266
name like this and we'll leave the value as 0,0,0. So it's in

51
00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:20.266
here that we actually set the Blackboard key, effectively these two nodes

52
00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:24.266
do it. You could put a comment around those two, "Set Blackboard

53
00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:28.266
Key". The only thing is, it's kind of confusing unless we drag things out

54
00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:32.266
What's going on? So why not space it out a little bit? So you

55
00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:36.266
use a Blackboard, you set the Blackboard key, and then, you run the Behavior Tree. Cool!

56
00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:40.266
Alright, let's see that working now! Play the game!

57
00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:44.266
What does he do?, He kind of hovers or slides himself to 0,0,0. So

58
00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:48.266
why is he sliding? Let's deal with that first. Well if you click on the

59
00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:52.266
instance here in the world, the ThirdPersonCharacter, it has a section called Animation.

60
00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:56.266
And previously, to get the animation working, we forced him to continually use a

61
00:03:56.266 --> 00:04:00.266
particular animation asset, which was the ThirdPersonIdle. Now we're going to

62
00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:04.266
revert back to doing it the other way, which is the Use the Animation Blueprint that

63
00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:08.266
he has got with him. We'll delve into the details of animation blueprints later, but let's just

64
00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:12.266
go back to using the default Third Person Animation Blueprint, like that. And

65
00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:16.266
then, what will happen is when we play, he will actually choose his animation state, let

66
00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:20.266
me show you that again, based on what he's doing. He runs to the origin, 0,0,0.

67
00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:24.266
If we depossess and click on him we can confirm he is

68
00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:28.266
close to the origin. He's not actually at the origin exactly, and the reason for that

69
00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:32.266
is that when we asked him to do a move to in

70
00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:36.266
here, you'll see that it's got an acceptable radius here of 5,

71
00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:40.266
so it's a question of what you set as this Acceptable Radius. If we set that

72
00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:44.266
down to say well even 0, then you run again

73
00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:48.266
and then we depossess and find out where he ends up, you'll find

74
00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:52.266
he may be a bit closer. But he's still a little bit away, particularly in Z. He's only

75
00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:56.266
20 or 30 centimeters away in X and Y, but in Z his origin

76
00:04:56.266 --> 00:05:00.266
has to be not at 0, 0, 0, because look his Z

77
00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:04.266
origin is up and down, is at his hip, and that is never going to be

78
00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:08.266
in the 0, 0, 0 position which is at the floor or just under the

79
00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:12.266
floor. Alright, so I'm just going to reset that acceptable radius. I just

80
00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:16.266
wanted to show you there, where that comes in to say 5.0 centimeters like that.

81
00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:20.266
And this is a very different way, you may have noticed, of doing AI to how we did it

82
00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:24.266
in Battle Tank. In Battle Tank, we still had all this going on behind the scenes but we circumvented

83
00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:28.266
this whole Behavior Tree thing and that was because we wanted to force the

84
00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:32.266
AI tanks to move in a very specific way using the controller, and it also

85
00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:36.266
allowed me to hid all this detail from you until this section. But this is the standard way

86
00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:40.266
of doing things. So we just move to the World Origin. The other thing to show you is, that if

87
00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:44.266
you go over to the Behavior Tree here, while

88
00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:48.266
it's running you can actually see what it's doing, especially if you do it quick enough. Click play, click over, and

89
00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:52.266
you can see its Selector, and then, it's going to Move To and then it's stopped. It's going to

90
00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:56.266
be a lot clearer, once we have a second node down here under the Selector, and that's what I

91
00:05:56.266 --> 00:06:00.266
want you to do right now. I want you to patrol between two points, modify the Behavior

92
00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:04.266
Tree, use the Sequence node instead of the Selector node,

93
00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:08.266
because remember that the Selector node does one thing and then stops

94
00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:12.266
running altogether, so he'd move to the origin and then stop. We want to use the Sequence node, so

95
00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:16.266
that we repeatedly move to the origin and then to a second

96
00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:20.266
location, that you're going to specify somewhere nearby inside the map,

97
00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:24.266
a few meters away. And in total, you're going to need to use two Blackboard keys, just create

98
00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:28.266
one new Blackboard key so that we have two in total, the World Origin and his

99
00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:32.266
second patrol point. So go ahead, pause the video, and see if you can make that work

100
00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:36.266
now.

101
00:06:36.266 --> 00:06:40.266
OK welcome back! So this will be a great revision of how to do this and let's

102
00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:44.266
take a look! So how are we going to do it? Well the first thing we're going to need really

103
00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:48.266
is to start at the Blackboard. We're going to need a new vector for this

104
00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:52.266
PatrolPoint, something like that. And it's called PatrolPoint

105
00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:56.266
and "Somewhere

106
00:06:56.266 --> 00:07:00.266
Else to go". That's just to get in the habit of ?putting comments in.

107
00:07:00.266 --> 00:07:04.266
We'll talk about what Instance Synced means later, it's not relevant till we have multiple AI

108
00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:08.266
controllers in the game. But we have this second key called PatrolPoint! Fantastic!

109
00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:12.266
Now, what would be the easiest way of setting this second Blackboard key? Well it would really

110
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:16.266
be just to copy this entire section here, not just

111
00:07:16.266 --> 00:07:20.266
a comment like I just did there, but you need to highlight the whole lot, Duplicate it by

112
00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:24.266
right-clicking, if you can do it like that. You have got to

113
00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:28.266
click in the right place, Duplicate, and then, you can move the whole thing over

114
00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:32.266
here. And what this just allows us to do... It's a little bit messy, to be

115
00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:36.266
honest, doing it this way. It may be easier to just select these two nodes,

116
00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:40.266
move the Behavior Tree out here, and Duplicate just them.

117
00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:44.266
You'll get the idea of duplicating nodes. Now, the reason I'm duplicating them and then

118
00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:48.266
rewiring this execution flow is because what we're doing this second time is very similar.

119
00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:52.266
But instead of going to WorldOrigin, we're going to be going to PatrolPoint.

120
00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:56.266
Remember use Cut and Paste. And we're going to use a different value. Now the way I'm going to discover

121
00:07:56.266 --> 00:08:00.266
my values is like this, I'm just going to click on this dude, I'm

122
00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:04.266
going to use this particular selector point here. So you see that the X

123
00:08:04.266 --> 00:08:08.266
and Y arrows have gone yellow, if I go there, and then, I can move him along

124
00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:12.266
the floor to say here. Notice roughly what the value is, 700 by

125
00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:16.266
400 would do it, and I'm just going to remember that value.

126
00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:20.266
I'll put him back somewhere else, it doesn't matter where, and I'm going to say

127
00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:24.266
700, 400. We don't have to worry that the Z is at his feet, he will

128
00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:28.266
sort that out, the AI Controller will sort that out. So all we've done there is

129
00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:32.266
set a second value, which means

130
00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:36.266
that in the Blackboard here that both of those values end up as set.

131
00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:40.266
Alright, now in the Behavior Tree, we're going to then need to change the Selector for a

132
00:08:40.266 --> 00:08:44.266
Sequence node, as I said. Now, you can see the difference, because you put it in and you hover

133
00:08:44.266 --> 00:08:48.266
over it, and it tells you the difference, and once the Sequence node is in, we then

134
00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:52.266
Move To WorldOrigin. And then, we're going to do another Move To.

135
00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:56.266
Move Directly Towards, by the way, ignores the navigation system, not a good idea at the moment,

136
00:08:56.266 --> 00:09:00.266
and the Blackboard key, the piece of data we're going to move to here is the patrol point.

137
00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:04.266
So let's firstly observe the behavior! Well there's a

138
00:09:04.266 --> 00:09:08.266
compiler error, so let's have a look! What's the problem in here?

139
00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:12.266
Ah, now the problem here is that I didn't wire up the Target! It needs to know

140
00:09:12.266 --> 00:09:16.266
what it is setting the value on. Which Blackboard

141
00:09:16.266 --> 00:09:20.266
am I setting the value on? So you need to pull that Blackboard Target through.

142
00:09:20.266 --> 00:09:24.266
OK, so we end up with this. Now let's try it!

143
00:09:24.266 --> 00:09:28.266
There he is, he runs to the 0, 0, 0 point, runs over there,

144
00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:32.266
runs back, runs over there, runs back. Now, if I depossess

145
00:09:32.266 --> 00:09:36.266
and go and have a look at the Patrol Behavior Tree, look what's happening.

146
00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:40.266
He's moving to the Origin, to the PatrolPoint, to the Origin, to the PatrolPoint. So well done! He's

147
00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:44.266
running back and forth, that's great! This is obviously not a sustainable way of

148
00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:48.266
continuing to add waypoints or patrol points

149
00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:52.266
to the system, so I'm going to show you shortly how to do this in a much more scalable and

150
00:09:52.266 --> 00:09:56.266
sustainable way. I'm just going to comment this second bit. "Set 2nd key",

151
00:09:56.266 --> 00:10:00.266
spread things out a little bit, and then, again I'm going to make

152
00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:04.266
my commit inside Source Tree here, after having

153
00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:08.266
Saved All and then, close Unreal. I'll go and make

154
00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:12.266
my commit, but I'll do that after I finish recording. So I'll see you in the next video!

155
00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:14.332
