1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.400
So just before we get into the markdown and a little bit of a speech on marketing.

2
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.400
let's just sort out a couple more things with regards to this source control. When I

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.400
opened up my Unreal. I've noticed it's spawned both Oculus and

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.400
SteamVR for me. This happened in the last section. So I'm going to prevent that

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.400
by going to Settings and Plugins. Virtual Reality. then I'm

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.400
just going to turn off Oculus. for now. If we add any support

7
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.400
for this stuff later. then I will turn it back on. but I'm going to turn all these off. for now. including Gear

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.400
VR. and then. I am going to restart the Editor

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.400
and let's watch what happens over in the source control. Already. there are some changes to the

10
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.400
.uproject. and what's happened in the .uproject file. if I just tab

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.400
back to it. is it's put some plain text in here. just

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.400
saying that all of these VR platforms are disabled. false. OK.

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.400
that's cool! So we could commit that change. but let's just do a couple of things! Firstly. I'm just

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.400
going to close down the Editor again. and I'm going to close the

15
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.400
VR apps. Oculus and Steam VR. and just make

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.400
sure that they do actually not spawn next time. So

17
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.400
both are asking me to confirm to close them. Now. let's reopen the .uproject.

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.400
and hopefully that change to this

19
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.400
.uproject file here will result in neither of the

20
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.400
VR apps opening. And it does! So now. let's test

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.400
if this Source Control. Submit to Source Control actually works.

22
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.400
when it comes to the very .uproject file itself. I want to explore the limitations

23
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.400
of this thing. so we Submit to Source Control. and it says "No assets to check in!"

24
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.400
so it's not infallible. It would work if we say move that block up in the

25
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.400
air to make a floating block. If I now say. Submit to Source

26
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.400
Control... I better Save All first. because that's the most

27
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.400
reliable way for us to be sure that. when we click Submit to Source

28
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.400
Control that. it actually does recognize there's a change to the map. then I

29
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.400
would be able to commit. But if you just make a change to something like the project settings. it

30
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.400
may not recognize it. So I am going to do the first commit from inside Unreal

31
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.400
here. and actually. I think what I'm going to call it is the very name of

32
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.400
this video. which is called Marketing & Markdown. So the way that I

33
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.400
name my videos is. I prefix them with TG for Testing Grounds.

34
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.400
and then. I have a .cmproj on the end. because it's a Camtasia project. So I'm going to

35
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.400
use this as a template. and this video is going to be called TG4.

36
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400
Testing Grounds video 4. and then. the name of it will be

37
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400
Marketing & Markdown. there you go .cmproj.

38
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.400
Now. let's just let it do that! "Checking file(s) into Source Control". I'm going to

39
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.400
close Unreal and have a look over here and see what's happening.

40
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.400
Let's just do a Refresh!

41
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.400
And you can see that it has committed TG4 Marketing & Markdown.

42
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.400
but Unreal has still not got this .uproject

43
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.400
information here. It just didn't notice that these things changed. so as I said. it's

44
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400
not infallible. when it comes to project settings. so there's a limitation. Now. say you have

45
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.400
this and you think. actually. I don't want this commit without these changes to this

46
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.400
.uproject in it. What would you do about that? Well what you could do is you could Reset that

47
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.400
Master Branch back here. So you'll right-click back on where I was

48
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.400
at the end of the previous video and you say Mixed is fine. It's going to "keep

49
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.400
the working copy but reset index". which means it'll move this

50
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.400
master tab down here. and then. all of those changes will be in our Uncommitted changes.

51
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.400
and just lumped together. the changes to the .uproject file and the changes to the map

52
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.400
that I made. remember when I made that cube float. Now I could commit from

53
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.400
SourceTree. with the same naming convention as before. I need to Stage

54
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400
everything and Commit. Let's just go in here and say

55
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.400
Marketing & Markdown.

56
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.400
I'm just going to use exactly the same name as I used in the slides.

57
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.400
just for consistency. Yep. that's an ampersand!

58
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.400
And I'm going to push it immediately to GitHub. once I've Staged All the files.

59
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.400
So I've covered a couple of different things there. pretty much as an aside. but

60
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.400
it's more about the source control. If you've made a mistake on a very recent commit.

61
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.400
especially before you've pushed it up to the web. you can reset

62
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.400
your branch back to a previous commit and you can lump together a

63
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400
couple of different commits. in that very simple way. There is another way of doing this. it's a

64
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.400
command called squash with git. but we don't need to go into that right now. The other thing that

65
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.400
we've noticed here is that Unreal doesn't necessarily notice a change to all files.

66
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.400
The meta files like the .uproject files and some of the Editor settings

67
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.400
and stuff. it may not notice they've changed. OK. So it's going to be really good at noticing

68
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.400
most of our changes to our assets. and it's going to allow us to commit from inside

69
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.400
Unreal. without having to exit it. by using that

70
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.400
to Source Control button but it's not infallible. So what I've done is. I've come out of Unreal and

71
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.400
done it the way I want it in Source Tree. Remember that source control.

72
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.400
in general. is a useless master

73
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.400
but a very good slave. That's the right saying. So by that I mean. you don't let it tell

74
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.400
you how you want things to be. you tell it how you want it to show your history. It's just going to

75
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.400
keep an eye out for you. This is how I want my history. so this is what I've

76
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.400
made it do. even if I have to change things. OK. Cool!

77
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400
So that's that! Now let's switch gears altogether! Still talking about

78
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.400
source control and GitHub but a little bit more peripheral. Let's go over to GitHub and have a

79
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.400
look at the Unreal course organization. Now this is an

80
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.400
organization that contains two people. me and Sam. both of the people working on this.

81
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.400
and there's a few things about it. Firstly. I want this to be public. Now

82
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.400
you've got to decide. do you want your game code to be public? You might not. but if you do.

83
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.400
with these tutorial projects. why not? Why not get yourself out there. the more you can be out there the better!

84
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.400
Then. present it nicely! So if I look. firstly. at the

85
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.400
Settings of the repo. what have we got here? Well I've bothered to put in a description.

86
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.400
I've bothered to put in a URL. including a discount

87
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.400
code. Why not? If somebody's going to click this URL. why not give them a discount. give them an opportunity to buy

88
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.400
straight away. We don't make a lot of money through that discount code but it's still an option. And then. other

89
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.400
details in here like e-mails. etc. OK. so do

90
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.400
that! Setup some sort of profile picture. because this is the face

91
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.400
of your repo. at the top here. Then. each of the Repositories. let's have

92
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.400
a look at BattleTank! BattleTank. when you hit it. has a README.md.

93
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.400
md stands for markdown. And if you look at "daring fireball

94
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.400
markdown". it'll give you the syntax of markdown here.

95
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.400
It's a very cleaver system. introduced by a blogger.

96
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.400
to write HTML without having to mess around with

97
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.400
actually writing all the HTML tags. So this is one place you can find it. and all

98
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.400
the information is down here. as to how you write it. We'll be doing some in a minute! And the other place you could look is.

99
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.400
you could look at "unreal answers markdown".

100
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.400
and they'll give you a cheatsheet on markdown as well. because another place you can

101
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.400
use markdown is on the Unreal UE4 AnswerHub. And it shows you like.

102
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.400
on double underlines give you a heading 1. etc. So why am I mentioning all of this? Because I want

103
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.400
you to present things nicely. with the Battle Tank here. because I've bothered to put all

104
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.400
this stuff here. I've even got a Lecture List in there. Why have I got a Lecture List?

105
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.400
Well the reason I've put the full Lecture List in here is. in order to get

106
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.400
some sort of. what I would call. Google juice. [Laughs] What I mean by that is. if somebody

107
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.400
is searching for one of these things. then. especially

108
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.400
if it's something a little bit unusual. like one of Unreal's commands or

109
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.400
something like that. then we will probably come up on Google.

110
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.400
Let's try it! Let's do a Google search for Using SpawnActor to Spawn! Because

111
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.400
what GitHub has given us here. in this repo. is a public webpage.

112
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.400
provided you want it public. then I don't know. I've never even tried

113
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.400
this. Let's try it! Using Spawn Actor to Spawn. If we scroll down. there's a load of Unreal

114
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.400
docs. but I suspect we don't need to go too many pages through Google.

115
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.400
before we hit our repo. Maybe

116
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.400
I've missed it. or maybe it's not referenced yet?

117
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.400
OK. so let's try another one! As an example. let's go back up and try...

118
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.400
I don't know. here Creating Default SubOb. the C++ Compilation Process.

119
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.400
No. that's too common. So when you're looking for people to find your stuff.

120
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.400
the C++ Compilation Process. I can't hope to compete on that

121
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.400
keyword on the Internet. but some of the less

122
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.400
common things I'm much more likely to be able to compete for.

123
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.400
So Delegating to Components. Using virtual and

124
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.400
override. Let's just try that. do a search for that. "unreal".

125
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.400
see if we get our repo. I'm doing this live. because I'm hoping that our

126
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.400
repo will come up in the first couple of pages for one of these. It certainly came up for one of the things I

127
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.400
tested recently. Now there's a GitHub repo coming up there. someone else's OSVR

128
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.400
on the VR headset. OK. well I'm not getting them coming up right now. But the

129
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.400
point is. it depends how long it's been on GitHub and it depends on

130
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.400
how competed that term is and a whole load of other stuff. but you're giving yourself

131
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.400
the greatest chance of this coming up on Google. Let's try something that will

132
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.400
come up like this. because it's a ridiculously uncommon search query

133
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.400
and you'll get the idea. The others are filtering their way up. Here you go! GitHub -

134
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.400
UnrealCourse: An open-world head-to-head. Now. if I open that as an incognito window. which I

135
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.400
always suggest you do when you're looking at websites. you can see what it looks like to the public. and you

136
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.400
can see straight away that somebody looking for that will find that. They'll probably. if they're tech savvy. do an in

137
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.400
page search. and with a bit of thinking. they'll realize that this is one of the videos of

138
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.400
this course. OK enough said on that! It's a little bit about search engine marketing and just trying to

139
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.400
get everything you can out there. get as many handles to your work as you can. Now what I want

140
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.400
to do is. I'm just going to quickly setup the README for this

141
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.400
section. or at least I'm going to look at the README.md and I'm going to edit

142
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.400
it. Which you can just click on the README.md. and if you don't have a README.md.

143
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.400
like TestingGrounds. you can create one down here. Add Readme. And that's

144
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.400
going to be your challenge! So you can hang on a second. I just want to show you a little bit about the markdown

145
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.400
format. and then. I'll challenge you to decorate and share your README.

146
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.400
Notice that this. which is the markdown on the left here. looks very different

147
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.400
to the repo once it's been

148
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.400
processed on the right. It's the same stuff but you see how links work. square brackets here?

149
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.400
It turns out like that. and in the normal braces or parentheses you put

150
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.400
the URL. You can see how I've got double hash.

151
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.400
because I don't want too big a title. which is my level 2 heading which is

152
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.400
coming out there. You can see that. in this instance. I forgot to put a star

153
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.400
against my BT01 so that's inconsistent there. and I could edit it right here on

154
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.400
the website. And then. the rest of these stars make an unordered list.

155
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.400
etc. So you can read about the markdown format. that is all in your

156
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.400
documentation. You can edit and add and edit your README file

157
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.400
right on GitHub. by saying Add Readme. You can say that you're just doing that. Commit the

158
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.400
changes. and then. go ahead and get the URL for your repo. like

159
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.400
this like the BattleTank one. it'll look something like this.

160
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.400
and share it with us over on the community site. Now. when you do that.

161
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.400
use the link in resources. because that'll take you to just the right place on the community site. Rather than

162
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.400
browsing through like I am. go to Resources on Udemy. and then. you will end up

163
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.400
inside Testing Grounds. inside this video which doesn't even exist yet. You can create a

164
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.400
discussion. Now interestingly. markdown also works in here. [a link].

165
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.400
And then if I go open brackets (www.test

166
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.400
.com). You see how it's looking on the right-hand side? "Here is"

167
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.400
and then. I can go back tick

168
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.400
" 'some code' ". and then.

169
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.400
it formats it like code. "A list" and then you can go "1.

170
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.400
First". "1. Second". and now notice that we can keep going

171
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.400
"1.". and I suggest you do. because then it doesn't put you under the illusion these

172
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.400
numbers have anything to do with the actual numbering. these are numbered in sequence. If you use 1.

173
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.400
all the time. it allows you to reorder things like that. You see how I moved third.

174
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.400
in between first and second on the left? Because I'm using 1.. i.e. any number and a

175
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.400
dot. then the numbering still works. So I'd suggest you use 1's. as a useful tip for you.

176
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.400
Star star for bold. star italic.

177
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.400
and they're the main things you're going to need. The link format like that.

178
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.400
code formatting. italics. etc. Headers. some big header. it's worth just using

179
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.400
underlines. or I prefer just using the hashes. "Big header".

180
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.400
"Small header".

181
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.400
OK you get it. so markdown is super useful! It's useful in

182
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.400
UE4 AnswerHub. it's useful in the GameDev.tv community

183
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.400
site. it's very useful on GitHub. Make your stuff pretty.

184
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.400
show off what you've got to offer. get yourself out there. make yourself findable.

185
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.400
ask for feedback really early. and you'll do much better.

186
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.400
So your challenge is to decorate and share your repo! Use organizations

187
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.400
and teams in GitHub if you need to or want to. Add a README.md

188
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.400
file and use MarkDown to format it nicely. Check the

189
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.400
visibility in a anonymous browser. like I just did. and note. of course.

190
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.400
all this assumes you're OK with your work being public. And then. share the link.

191
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.400
share using the link in the Resources in the community side. and ask everybody for

192
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.400
feedback. And also think. how else can you get feedback about your game? Where else could you go. Twitter.

193
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.400
Facebook. etc.? Get feedback on your code. get feedback on everything.

194
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.400
it's fantastic! I love the feedback that you guys give me. and I really encourage you to start getting

195
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.400
feedback on your projects as early and as often as possible. Fail regularly

196
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.400
and you'll get better! That's how kids learn to walk. remember? You know. if you saw two

197
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.400
small kids. neither of which could walk. but one. you said to the

198
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.400
parent. how many times has that kid fallen over trying to walk? And they say. oh 50.

199
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.400
and the other said. oh he's only fallen over once. this is his first attempt. Well which kid's going to walk first?

200
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.400
Well it's going to be the kid that's fallen over 50 times! Paradoxically.

201
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.400
that's the only way to learn to walk and it's the only way to learn to market and it's the

202
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.400
only way to learn to code! So please. fail fast. fail regularly. have fun.

203
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.400
share with us. and I'll see you in the next video!

204
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.666


=======

1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,400
So just before we get into the markdown and a little bit of a speech on marketing,

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
let's just sort out a couple more things with regards to this source control. When I

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,400
opened up my Unreal, I've noticed it's spawned both Oculus and

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,400
SteamVR for me. This happened in the last section. So I'm going to prevent that

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,400
by going to Settings and Plugins, Virtual Reality, then I'm

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
just going to turn off Oculus, for now. If we add any support

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
for this stuff later, then I will turn it back on, but I'm going to turn all these off, for now, including Gear

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,400
VR, and then, I am going to restart the Editor

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,400
and let's watch what happens over in the source control. Already, there are some changes to the

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,400
.uproject, and what's happened in the .uproject file, if I just tab

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,400
back to it, is it's put some plain text in here, just

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,400
saying that all of these VR platforms are disabled, false. OK,

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,400
that's cool! So we could commit that change, but let's just do a couple of things! Firstly, I'm just

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
going to close down the Editor again, and I'm going to close the

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,400
VR apps, Oculus and Steam VR, and just make

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
sure that they do actually not spawn next time. So

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
both are asking me to confirm to close them. Now, let's reopen the .uproject,

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
and hopefully that change to this

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
.uproject file here will result in neither of the

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
VR apps opening. And it does! So now, let's test

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
if this Source Control, Submit to Source Control actually works,

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
when it comes to the very .uproject file itself. I want to explore the limitations

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,400
of this thing, so we Submit to Source Control, and it says "No assets to check in!"

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,400
so it's not infallible. It would work if we say move that block up in the

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,400
air to make a floating block. If I now say, Submit to Source

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Control... I better Save All first, because that's the most

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
reliable way for us to be sure that, when we click Submit to Source

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Control that, it actually does recognize there's a change to the map, then I

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
would be able to commit. But if you just make a change to something like the project settings, it

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,400
may not recognize it. So I am going to do the first commit from inside Unreal

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,400
here, and actually, I think what I'm going to call it is the very name of

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,400
this video, which is called Marketing & Markdown. So the way that I

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
name my videos is, I prefix them with TG for Testing Grounds,

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
and then, I have a .cmproj on the end, because it's a Camtasia project. So I'm going to

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
use this as a template, and this video is going to be called TG4,

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Testing Grounds video 4, and then, the name of it will be

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Marketing & Markdown, there you go .cmproj.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Now, let's just let it do that! "Checking file(s) into Source Control". I'm going to

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
close Unreal and have a look over here and see what's happening.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Let's just do a Refresh!

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
And you can see that it has committed TG4 Marketing & Markdown,

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
but Unreal has still not got this .uproject

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
information here. It just didn't notice that these things changed, so as I said, it's

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,400
not infallible, when it comes to project settings, so there's a limitation. Now, say you have

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
this and you think, actually, I don't want this commit without these changes to this

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
.uproject in it. What would you do about that? Well what you could do is you could Reset that

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Master Branch back here. So you'll right-click back on where I was

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
at the end of the previous video and you say Mixed is fine. It's going to "keep

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
the working copy but reset index", which means it'll move this

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
master tab down here, and then, all of those changes will be in our Uncommitted changes,

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
and just lumped together, the changes to the .uproject file and the changes to the map

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
that I made, remember when I made that cube float. Now I could commit from

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
SourceTree, with the same naming convention as before. I need to Stage

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
everything and Commit. Let's just go in here and say

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Marketing & Markdown.

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm just going to use exactly the same name as I used in the slides,

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
just for consistency. Yep, that's an ampersand!

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
And I'm going to push it immediately to GitHub, once I've Staged All the files.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
So I've covered a couple of different things there, pretty much as an aside, but

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
it's more about the source control. If you've made a mistake on a very recent commit,

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
especially before you've pushed it up to the web, you can reset

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
your branch back to a previous commit and you can lump together a

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
couple of different commits, in that very simple way. There is another way of doing this, it's a

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
command called squash with git, but we don't need to go into that right now. The other thing that

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
we've noticed here is that Unreal doesn't necessarily notice a change to all files.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
The meta files like the .uproject files and some of the Editor settings

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
and stuff, it may not notice they've changed, OK. So it's going to be really good at noticing

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
most of our changes to our assets, and it's going to allow us to commit from inside

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Unreal, without having to exit it, by using that

70
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
to Source Control button but it's not infallible. So what I've done is, I've come out of Unreal and

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
done it the way I want it in Source Tree. Remember that source control,

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
in general, is a useless master

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
but a very good slave. That's the right saying. So by that I mean, you don't let it tell

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
you how you want things to be, you tell it how you want it to show your history. It's just going to

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,400
keep an eye out for you. This is how I want my history, so this is what I've

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,400
made it do, even if I have to change things, OK. Cool!

77
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
So that's that! Now let's switch gears altogether! Still talking about

78
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
source control and GitHub but a little bit more peripheral. Let's go over to GitHub and have a

79
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
look at the Unreal course organization. Now this is an

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
organization that contains two people, me and Sam, both of the people working on this,

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,400
and there's a few things about it. Firstly, I want this to be public. Now

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
you've got to decide, do you want your game code to be public? You might not, but if you do,

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
with these tutorial projects, why not? Why not get yourself out there, the more you can be out there the better!

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Then, present it nicely! So if I look, firstly, at the

85
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Settings of the repo, what have we got here? Well I've bothered to put in a description.

86
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
I've bothered to put in a URL, including a discount

87
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
code. Why not? If somebody's going to click this URL, why not give them a discount, give them an opportunity to buy

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
straight away. We don't make a lot of money through that discount code but it's still an option. And then, other

89
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
details in here like e-mails, etc. OK, so do

90
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
that! Setup some sort of profile picture, because this is the face

91
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,400
of your repo, at the top here. Then, each of the Repositories, let's have

92
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
a look at BattleTank! BattleTank, when you hit it, has a README.md,

93
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,400
md stands for markdown. And if you look at "daring fireball

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,400
markdown", it'll give you the syntax of markdown here.

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
It's a very cleaver system, introduced by a blogger,

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,400
to write HTML without having to mess around with

97
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
actually writing all the HTML tags. So this is one place you can find it, and all

98
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
the information is down here, as to how you write it. We'll be doing some in a minute! And the other place you could look is,

99
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,400
you could look at "unreal answers markdown",

100
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,400
and they'll give you a cheatsheet on markdown as well, because another place you can

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
use markdown is on the Unreal UE4 AnswerHub. And it shows you like,

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
on double underlines give you a heading 1, etc. So why am I mentioning all of this? Because I want

103
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
you to present things nicely, with the Battle Tank here, because I've bothered to put all

104
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,400
this stuff here. I've even got a Lecture List in there. Why have I got a Lecture List?

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Well the reason I've put the full Lecture List in here is, in order to get

106
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
some sort of, what I would call, Google juice. [Laughs] What I mean by that is, if somebody

107
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,400
is searching for one of these things, then, especially

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
if it's something a little bit unusual, like one of Unreal's commands or

109
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
something like that, then we will probably come up on Google.

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Let's try it! Let's do a Google search for Using SpawnActor to Spawn! Because

111
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
what GitHub has given us here, in this repo, is a public webpage,

112
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
provided you want it public, then I don't know. I've never even tried

113
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,400
this. Let's try it! Using Spawn Actor to Spawn. If we scroll down, there's a load of Unreal

114
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
docs, but I suspect we don't need to go too many pages through Google,

115
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,400
before we hit our repo. Maybe

116
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I've missed it, or maybe it's not referenced yet?

117
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
OK, so let's try another one! As an example, let's go back up and try...

118
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
I don't know, here Creating Default SubOb, the C++ Compilation Process.

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
No, that's too common. So when you're looking for people to find your stuff,

120
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
the C++ Compilation Process, I can't hope to compete on that

121
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
keyword on the Internet, but some of the less

122
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
common things I'm much more likely to be able to compete for.

123
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
So Delegating to Components, Using virtual and

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
override. Let's just try that, do a search for that, "unreal",

125
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
see if we get our repo. I'm doing this live, because I'm hoping that our

126
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
repo will come up in the first couple of pages for one of these. It certainly came up for one of the things I

127
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,400
tested recently. Now there's a GitHub repo coming up there, someone else's OSVR

128
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,400
on the VR headset. OK, well I'm not getting them coming up right now. But the

129
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,400
point is, it depends how long it's been on GitHub and it depends on

130
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,400
how competed that term is and a whole load of other stuff, but you're giving yourself

131
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,400
the greatest chance of this coming up on Google. Let's try something that will

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,400
come up like this, because it's a ridiculously uncommon search query

133
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,400
and you'll get the idea. The others are filtering their way up. Here you go! GitHub -

134
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,400
UnrealCourse: An open-world head-to-head. Now, if I open that as an incognito window, which I

135
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
always suggest you do when you're looking at websites, you can see what it looks like to the public, and you

136
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,400
can see straight away that somebody looking for that will find that. They'll probably, if they're tech savvy, do an in

137
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,400
page search, and with a bit of thinking, they'll realize that this is one of the videos of

138
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,400
this course. OK enough said on that! It's a little bit about search engine marketing and just trying to

139
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,400
get everything you can out there, get as many handles to your work as you can. Now what I want

140
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
to do is, I'm just going to quickly setup the README for this

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,400
section, or at least I'm going to look at the README.md and I'm going to edit

142
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,400
it. Which you can just click on the README.md, and if you don't have a README.md,

143
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
like TestingGrounds, you can create one down here, Add Readme. And that's

144
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,400
going to be your challenge! So you can hang on a second, I just want to show you a little bit about the markdown

145
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,400
format, and then, I'll challenge you to decorate and share your README.

146
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Notice that this, which is the markdown on the left here, looks very different

147
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
to the repo once it's been

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,400
processed on the right. It's the same stuff but you see how links work, square brackets here?

149
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,400
It turns out like that, and in the normal braces or parentheses you put

150
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,400
the URL. You can see how I've got double hash,

151
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,400
because I don't want too big a title, which is my level 2 heading which is

152
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,400
coming out there. You can see that, in this instance, I forgot to put a star

153
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,400
against my BT01 so that's inconsistent there, and I could edit it right here on

154
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,400
the website. And then, the rest of these stars make an unordered list,

155
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,400
etc. So you can read about the markdown format, that is all in your

156
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
documentation. You can edit and add and edit your README file

157
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,400
right on GitHub, by saying Add Readme. You can say that you're just doing that, Commit the

158
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,400
changes, and then, go ahead and get the URL for your repo, like

159
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,400
this like the BattleTank one, it'll look something like this,

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,400
and share it with us over on the community site. Now, when you do that,

161
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,400
use the link in resources, because that'll take you to just the right place on the community site. Rather than

162
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,400
browsing through like I am, go to Resources on Udemy, and then, you will end up

163
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,400
inside Testing Grounds, inside this video which doesn't even exist yet. You can create a

164
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,400
discussion. Now interestingly, markdown also works in here, [a link].

165
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,400
And then if I go open brackets (www.test

166
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,400
.com). You see how it's looking on the right-hand side? "Here is"

167
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,400
and then, I can go back tick

168
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,400
" 'some code' ", and then,

169
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,400
it formats it like code. "A list" and then you can go "1.

170
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,400
First", "1. Second", and now notice that we can keep going

171
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
"1.", and I suggest you do, because then it doesn't put you under the illusion these

172
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,400
numbers have anything to do with the actual numbering, these are numbered in sequence. If you use 1.

173
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,400
all the time, it allows you to reorder things like that. You see how I moved third,

174
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,400
in between first and second on the left? Because I'm using 1., i.e. any number and a

175
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,400
dot, then the numbering still works. So I'd suggest you use 1's, as a useful tip for you.

176
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Star star for bold, star italic,

177
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,400
and they're the main things you're going to need. The link format like that,

178
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
code formatting, italics, etc. Headers, some big header, it's worth just using

179
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,400
underlines, or I prefer just using the hashes, "Big header",

180
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,400
"Small header".

181
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,400
OK you get it, so markdown is super useful! It's useful in

182
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,400
UE4 AnswerHub, it's useful in the GameDev.tv community

183
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,400
site, it's very useful on GitHub. Make your stuff pretty,

184
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,400
show off what you've got to offer, get yourself out there, make yourself findable,

185
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,400
ask for feedback really early, and you'll do much better.

186
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,400
So your challenge is to decorate and share your repo! Use organizations

187
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,400
and teams in GitHub if you need to or want to. Add a README.md

188
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,400
file and use MarkDown to format it nicely. Check the

189
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,400
visibility in a anonymous browser, like I just did, and note, of course,

190
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,400
all this assumes you're OK with your work being public. And then, share the link,

191
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,400
share using the link in the Resources in the community side, and ask everybody for

192
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,400
feedback. And also think, how else can you get feedback about your game? Where else could you go, Twitter,

193
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Facebook, etc.? Get feedback on your code, get feedback on everything,

194
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,400
it's fantastic! I love the feedback that you guys give me, and I really encourage you to start getting

195
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,400
feedback on your projects as early and as often as possible. Fail regularly

196
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,400
and you'll get better! That's how kids learn to walk, remember? You know, if you saw two

197
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,400
small kids, neither of which could walk, but one, you said to the

198
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,400
parent, how many times has that kid fallen over trying to walk? And they say, oh 50,

199
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,400
and the other said, oh he's only fallen over once, this is his first attempt. Well which kid's going to walk first?

200
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Well it's going to be the kid that's fallen over 50 times! Paradoxically,

201
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,400
that's the only way to learn to walk and it's the only way to learn to market and it's the

202
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,400
only way to learn to code! So please, fail fast, fail regularly, have fun,

203
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,400
share with us, and I'll see you in the next video!

204
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,666
