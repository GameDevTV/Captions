00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey guys, Ben with you here, and welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.400
Testing Grounds GDD, the Game Design Document! So let's dive in and see what the vision for this game is!

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.400
So slightly inspired by the Hunger Games, you're a contestant in an entertainment

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.400
game, some sort of sick game where you are being watched and you have to try and

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.400
survive as many testing grounds as possible. So

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.400
the question is, can you reach the end? Is there even an end to the game? [Laughs]

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.400
Are there an infinite number of grounds or not? Well we will let the player 1 know

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.400
whether or not there are an infinite number of grounds, and, indeed, we're going to decide

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.400
on how many there are, based on how we create the assets. And that we're going to

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.400
decide as we go through the section, depending on whether we end up down the procedural

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.400
generation route or down the route of creating testing

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.400
grounds by hand. If it's by hand then, obviously it's going to be finite.

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.400
You can use force or stealth to pass through the grounds.

14
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.400
So you'll understand more about that, as we go through this GDD, but basically,

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.400
you can fight your way through or sneak your way through or a combination of both.

16
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.400
So the rules are, you can pass a testing ground undetected,

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.400
if detected you must clear the area, and check points

18
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.400
save when you pass into a new area, so pretty simple stuff. If you're killed you'll return

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.400
to the last checkpoint, and you and enemies will be fighting for the same

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.400
ammo resources and you're scored, ultimately, on how many areas you can

21
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.400
pass. This bit about fighting for the same ammo resources I thought it would

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.400
be a bit of fun! The AI will need to look for ammo on dead bodies

23
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.400
or on pickups, and you'll all be looking for the same ammo, rather than the

24
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.400
AI just having like infinite ammo. I thought that'd be a bit of fun! OK so,

25
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.400
what do we need? We're going to need some testing ground landscapes, either made by hand or procedurally

26
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.400
generated. We're going to need some Unreal starter content,

27
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.400
plus the landscape tools that they've got built in, some guns, some ammo boxes.

28
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.400
A rigged humanoid character, which we can modify, the one that Unreal

29
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.400
gives us should be fine. And various sound effects, I'm going to be

30
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.400
using samples from Gamemaster Audio, who's kindly, well not donated, but said that we

31
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.400
can use samples from their pack provided that we credit him. So I really

32
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.400
appreciate that! And of course, other stuff I haven't though of yet. [Laughs] So there'll be

33
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.400
other requirements, but the whole point here, with a Game Design Document, is not

34
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.400
to go nuts. You really want to just get on with making the game quite quickly and get to

35
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.400
the fun as quickly as you can, and then, as soon as it's fun get it out to your people to

36
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.400
try. So this other stuff I haven't thought of yet is kind of a light

37
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400
hearted jib, but the idea is to say, look

38
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400
there's going to be tons of stuff you haven't thought of but let's get an overall grand idea

39
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.400
of the type of requirements. Typically, programmers will underestimate the amount

40
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.400
of content required. Remember content is king, content meaning

41
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.400
audio, original audio, content meaning meshes, textures, etc.

42
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.400
So all of that stuff can take a huge amount of time, and it's usually important,

43
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.400
it's the thing that makes your game unique. So technical cha...

44
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.400
[Laughs] Potential Technical Challenges, rather than potechnical tencial

45
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400
challenges. Serialization when saving. So we want to be able to

46
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.400
save at the checkpoint, but we want to be able to save most of the state of the game at the

47
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.400
checkpoint, at least your ammo and any weapons and all this type of

48
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.400
stuff. So we may have some challenges with serialization and we'll do our best to solve those.

49
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.400
The whole architecture of a checkpoint system, so

50
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.400
you alert a lot of guards, that means the area's locked down a bit like in

51
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.400
the modern Doom game. How do we know, how does the game know, how does the

52
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.400
checkpoint know when all those enemies are killed, and what is an area and all

53
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.400
these sorts of questions? It's all about responsibility, dependencies, architecture, lots

54
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.400
of ways of doing it, of course, but we'll be discussing some of the ways and the pros and

55
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400
cons. If we get to co-op play, then we're going to

56
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.400
have to make sure that the networking is smooth in there, and procedural

57
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.400
generation of the testing grounds, if we go down that route, that could present some interesting challenges.

58
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.400
And the whole idea of creating a new skeletal animation,

59
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.400
for us dev types, could be challenging, because it may not be that

60
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.400
easy just to add a new animation into an already professionally animated

61
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.400
character. So there are some challenges we may meet! Now, let's talk about, for

62
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.400
a moment, how the grounds spawn and the whole layout.

63
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.400
So here's the first testing ground here! And you come in on the left-

64
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400
hand side, and there's already a second testing ground spawned.

65
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.400
Behind you will be a red force field, effectively a closed door,

66
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.400
but I think I'll make it an opaque red force field. And in front of you, initially,

67
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.400
will be a semiopaque green force field, kind of luring

68
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.400
you to that end. So the idea is to head left to right. You'll see in the distance, you should be able to see

69
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.400
through it into at least the next testing ground, and there will be this open door

70
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.400
effectively, and in here we'll have enemies and cover and basically a terrain.

71
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.400
Now, if you alert an AI the far door will close, the area

72
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.400
will lock down. The moment the area's locked down, the

73
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.400
only way you can then get out is to clear all of the enemies. So once the last

74
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.400
AI none player character is dead, this door will reopen, or this force field

75
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.400
will grow green again. You can then pass through, and the moment you pass through it locks

76
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.400
behind you, that's the cruelty of this thing! But the one in front of you is giving you

77
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.400
hope again, you can make it to the other side! If you can sneak to the other side, you can

78
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400
pass straight through. If you get detected then it's going to lock down

79
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.400
and the whole cycle is going to repeat. So hopefully it's pretty clear what's

80
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.400
going on there. OK, so that'll provide a pretty

81
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.400
cool basis for the game. Now you're welcome to add any other things you want, and

82
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.400
especially if those things can be done using what you've already learned in Battle Tank or Building

83
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.400
Escape. So I want you to think about what the scope of your game is going to be, your Game Design Document.

84
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.400
The more advanced you are, the more you want to deviate from my ideas.

85
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.400
The less advanced you are, the less comfortable you are, the more you want to just stick to what we're giving you.

86
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.400
Write a post on our forum community.gamedev.tv. Use the link

87
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.400
in the resources of this lecture, that'll take you exactly to the right place to

88
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.400
write that post. It'll take you to the right sub-section of Unreal, but also,

89
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.400
it'll tag the post with the correct lecture tag and that will help

90
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.400
everybody else find it. Start a new topic, write your GDD,

91
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.400
and use markdown to format it. Why not get a little bit used to using markdown. Now that's not

92
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.400
just so that you make pretty posts on our forum, but markdown is used in a lot of different

93
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.400
places, it's an approximation or simplification of HTML.

94
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.400
But also, we're going to be talking about, in the very next lecture, Git and

95
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.400
the readme.md file, which is a markdown file that is on the Git

96
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.400
repositories that are on Github.com,

97
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.400
and so I just want you to start getting used to Markdown. You can do a Google search

98
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.400
for Daring Fireball Markdown, and I'll put that in your resources.

99
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.400
That's the kind of definitive guide to the syntax of markdown, and just

100
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.400
use at least some markdown and also our forum will guide you on that as well. And

101
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.400
include sketches, you can upload images. So go ahead, share your GDD with us

102
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.400
in the forum, and that's it for this video! I'm not going to do anymore, I've already

103
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.266
written the GDD, you just saw mine. And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture!
