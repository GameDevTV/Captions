Hey guys and welcome to Testing Grounds! Firstly, who is this man?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Sam! Hi guys! You may have seen Sam help you out in the Support

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and in the VR course, the Unity course, various other courses. Sam's been helping

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
me all along, actually, with this course in the background, in the programming, and

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
working on the code together. But what are you going to be doing in this section, Sam?

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So in this section I'm going to be getting more involved in

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
some of the lectures and teaching some of the lectures, and we're going to be working together

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
as we did before and prototyping the section and basically getting to

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
grips with what we're going to actually teach you guys. And because this is early access, at this

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
stage, we don't know exactly how many videos I'll be doing, I might do all of them, how many videos sam will be doing,

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
he might be doing all of them or what the mix is going to be, but please please give us feedback.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If you prefer learning from me just say so, if you prefer learning from Sam... Yeah, no hard

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
feelings at all, we want to give you guys the best teaching possible and the best teaching you prefer, so

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
just let us know what you would rather see. Yeah and there's three types of feedback,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if you prefer either instructor say so or if you just prefer a continuative instructor,

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
like do you mind how often your mind is changing, just tell us early on,

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
because this talking head will be replaced when the section is finished. The section is on early access. Yep.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What does that mean? that means you're pretty safe to take it now, but that does mean that two or three videos

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
at the end, the latest two or three, might just get changed. Sometimes we backtrack

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
two or three to improve things. Yeah, when we want to improve things, exactly. What else?

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's the most ambitious section yet! It is and we've got lots of cool stuff

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
coming for you, so you've got to wait and see what we're going to be including in the Game Design Document.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yeah, and we don't know precisely the scope at this stage, because we're recording this so that we can

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
start the section, and then we'll come back at the end of the section and replace this video. So we don't know exactly

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
what the scope will be, but when you see in next slide,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in the next lecture, you'll see roughly what it involves. Exactly. What else?

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Bookmark the live Google slides. Yep. We always like to get your feedback right on the

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
slides, in terms of what we're teaching, as early as possible so that we can filter it

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and adapt to what you guys want to see. Particularly typos and stuff, if you can catch them

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
when we've typed them that's great! It's kind of fun for you to watch us to fill out the slides

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
as we go. We try not to swear too much. What else? So comment in

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
slides, typos, oh yeah and go over to community.gamedev.tv! Yep, it's the place to be!

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So we'd love to see you guys engaging there, sharing your games, sharing your cool creations

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you made with Unreal, and your progress, obviously, in this section.

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Absolutely! So enjoy it, we're looking forward to it, and we'll see you in there!

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.066
