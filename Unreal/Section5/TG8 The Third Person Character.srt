
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So welcome to The

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Third Person Character! In this video we will be adding a Third Person Character

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to our scene! There he is, standing on the ground, breathing away, and the other thing

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,266
we'll be doing is adding this green Navmesh and making sure that it's nice and smooth up the stairs. So I will see you in there!

5
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:22,266
So in the last video I said I would Tag my Commit. Let me show you what that is! Here's the

6
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:26,266
commit for the last video. If you click on Tag here, you can either

7
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:30,266
Tag the branch, basically, or a specific commit. I'm going to go

8
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:34,266
ahead and Tag this specific commit, and I'm just going to Tag

9
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:38,266
it with version 4.13.0

10
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:42,266
like that. And then, or just 4.13.0.

11
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:46,266
There you go! And what that does is it just puts that tag one, and as

12
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:50,266
the master label heads up the tree, this 4.13.0

13
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:54,266
will stay there, and it's just a really quick and easy way for me to see in which video I upgraded

14
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:58,266
my version. Not a bad thing to do to keep track of where you upgraded your versions. OK

15
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,266
so let's go back over to Unreal and let's just take a look at what we need to do

16
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:06,266
next! Of course, what we're going to need to make this even remotely interesting, just move that

17
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:10,266
out, is a Third Person Character in here that's going to be running around and

18
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:14,266
is going to act as a guard, and we're going to be focusing on creating patrol routes for those

19
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:18,266
guards. So where do we get a third person character from? Well there's no point in us building these up

20
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:22,266
from the ground. What I'd rather do with the First Person and the Third Person

21
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:26,266
is to use what Unreal already gave us, like this FirstPerson character

22
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:30,266
here, and then, start breaking it down as we need to, because frankly it already

23
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:34,266
works. It would be weeks of work to produce this thing from scratch, and we will learn

24
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:38,266
what all these parameters mean. Now, in the previous video I talked

25
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:42,266
about parameters, but a quiz question is coming up. There's going to be a question about

26
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:46,266
how to change the CharacterMovement speed. So just be aware it's under CharacterMovement,

27
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:50,266
and then, you've got in here, you've got the idea of Maximum Walking Speed,

28
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:54,266
when you're crouched and standing and things like that. OK, so let's go ahead and get

29
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:58,266
the Third Person in! How do you do that? Well, what we come

30
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:02,266
to is the Content Browser, Add New, and then, Add Feature or Content

31
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:06,266
Pack. Then, let's click over to C++ feature, and we can actually

32
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:10,266
bring in the necessary stuff from the Third Person

33
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:14,266
Demo project. So you'll see it's a slightly different world! We started off with a

34
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:18,266
First Person as our template, because we are fundamentally making a Third Person game. But we

35
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:22,266
can bring in the assets from the Third Person project, too, so that's

36
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:26,266
Add New, C++ Feature, and then Third Person. Let's go ahead and do that!

37
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:30,266
And it's going to add a whole lot of stuff to our project! You can watch what's happening

38
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,266
in version control, by hitting F5, letting it refresh,

39
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:38,266
and you'll see that it's adding quite a lot of stuff in here. It's making changes to the

40
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:42,266
engine, n.e. telling it that it's got these things included, and then, it's adding a lot

41
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:46,266
of stuff meshes, textures, materials, and animations, which we'll be talking

42
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,266
about plenty, later in the section. So

43
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:54,266
"Added source file". "Would you like to edit the code now?" No I don't need to edit the code right now,

44
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:58,266
and here we go! If we look more carefully at the Content Browser now,

45
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:02,266
you'll see that we've got quite a few directories. We've got FirstPerson, FirstPerson

46
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:06,266
CPP, Mannequin, ThirdPerson, ThirdPersonCPP. Now,

47
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:10,266
don't just  go moving stuff around yet and reorganizing this, because it can actually

48
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:14,266
break it due to references. We will move things around

49
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:18,266
and tidy up this Hierarchy as we need to, but for now, let's just allow

50
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:22,266
ourselves to have this slightly messy content hierarchy.

51
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:26,266
And later on, I will talk about things called redirectors, which you can actually

52
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:30,266
show here in the Filters menu. We

53
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:34,266
need to be showing the redirectors, before we start moving things around, and we'll

54
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:38,266
get to that when we need to. But if you do feel the absolute urge to move things

55
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:42,266
around, then turn Show Redirectors on now, and you'll see that

56
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:46,266
there are some complications with moving files around, it doesn't just move them. As I said,

57
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:50,266
we'll get to that when we need to get to that. For now, let's go into ThirdPersonCPP,

58
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:54,266
Blueprints, and ThirdPersonCharacter. Let's just drop one in the scene, and I'll snap

59
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:58,266
to the floor. There he is! So I'm going to play the game, go find him, and have a look at him.

60
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:02,266
Where is he? What's he doing? Well he is just kind of standing there doing

61
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:06,266
something a bit strange! [Laughs] What is this ThirdPerson character and

62
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:10,266
what on Earth is he doing in our game? Well let's firstly go and have a look at him!

63
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:14,266
And there he is, there's the instance of the ThirdPersonCharacter, sitting here in our map.

64
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:18,266
If we edit the ThirdPersonCharacter and go to the Full Blueprint Editor,

65
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:22,266
we'll get a very similar thing to the FirstPersonCharacter. In fact, if I flick between them for a moment,

66
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:26,266
you can see that they're very very similar but there are some differences. So

67
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,266
here is the ThirdPersonCharacter, and he has a Skeletal

68
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:34,266
Mesh, one of these meshes that can actually move and deform. And he has a default

69
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:38,266
kind of breathing idle animation that he has here. The camera with a Third

70
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:42,266
Person is behind him. We don't actually need that camera, there's no harm in leaving the camera there, for the moment.

71
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:46,266
The game, if you play it, will be automatically using that First Person

72
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:50,266
camera. There is actually a camera sitting behind the ThirdPerson

73
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:54,266
Character but it's just not being used right now. OK, so back to

74
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:58,266
the ThirdPersonCharacter. Let's have a look at what's going on with this guy!

75
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:02,266
Firstly, how do we choose what default animation he

76
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:06,266
has? So he's standing on the ground quite comfortably here in the

77
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:10,266
Blueprint Editor and just breathing away. But if we look inside the actual game,

78
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:14,266
he's doing some weird stuff. So the most likely is, it's just that he is

79
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:18,266
impacting with the ground, i.e. his Capsule Collider here

80
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:22,266
or his feet are going though the ground. So the simple solution to that is to lift him up a little bit,

81
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:26,266
and then, have a look at him and see if he's any better.

82
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:30,266
It hasn't helped! Let's lift him up further, and if it still doesn't help, then, we will go further

83
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:34,266
and look at his default animation state. So let's lift him plenty off the ground.

84
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:38,266
No he's doing something very

85
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:42,266
strange! So let's click on the ThirdPersonCharacter and start exploring

86
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:46,266
a little bit about what he can do. So if you click into him

87
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:50,266
and then search, because there's a lot of properties on this guy, if we search

88
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,266
for animation

89
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:58,266
then you'll see it brings up some of the, just some

90
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:02,266
of the components and their details. So it's saying Use an Animation

91
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:06,266
Blueprint. Well for the moment let's just, rather than using a Blueprint to control his animation,

92
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:10,266
let's just Use an Animation Asset right now, and then, specifically

93
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:14,266
pick an idle animation, ThirdPersonIdle there.

94
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:18,266
So what I've done is, I've said the Animation Mode is a specific asset, and then, I've picked the Third

95
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:22,266
PersonIdle animation. Let's take a look!

96
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:26,266
There he is, standing there much more sensible and breathing. I'll just pop him

97
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:30,266
on the ground, with the End key now. And that little sequence just gives you an idea of how you might

98
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:34,266
want to debug these things. I mean I knew that it was the animation there, but I just wanted to point

99
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:38,266
out that those sorts of strange behaviors could also be, especially with rag doll

100
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:42,266
based characters, to do with collisions. So it's always worth checking things aren't

101
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:46,266
passing through the ground first, especially when you just dump them in the scene and not check their position.

102
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:50,266
Anyway, there he is, he's in the scene, and he's got a ThirdPersonIdle animation on him,

103
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:54,266
and he's standing there quite happily! So that's the ThirdPersonCharacter,

104
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:58,266
he will be ready now to start moving around the scene. What I want you

105
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:02,266
to do now is, to simply add a Navmesh. Of course, before

106
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:06,266
we can get this thing moving around, we're going to need a Navmesh in our level. We've done it before

107
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:10,266
in Battle Tank! Ensure it covers "up the stairs", so you need the three dimensionality, the height, to

108
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:14,266
cover the area up the stairs as well. Preview it with the P key

109
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:18,266
and then share a still of what you've got, over on the community

110
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:22,266
site at community.gamedev.tv. So go ahead pause the video, and just add yourself a Navmesh

111
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:26,266
now! Welcome

112
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:30,266
back! So this is a pretty simple challenge, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show Navmesh,

113
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:34,266
which is the Show, Navigation which I can use the Show menu or I can just hit the

114
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:38,266
P key. You'll see there is no navigation, right now. So I make myself a

115
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:42,266
little more room, grab the Modes brush, I'm going to say

116
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:46,266
Volumes here, and then, under Volumes somewhere we should have Nav Mesh

117
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,266
Bounds Volume. There it is! I'm going to pop it in! Now I find when positioning

118
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:54,266
these Nav Meshes, it's quite useful to use this four way view here,

119
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:58,266
because that gives me an overview of the whole level in one go. So I

120
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:02,266
can see the side, I can see the front, etc. all in one go!

121
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:06,266
So now, we need to select the Nav Mesh, one way to do that is

122
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:10,266
here, go to Details, clearing my search,

123
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:14,266
and now it's just a question of changing the size of this Nav Mesh, so that it's

124
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:18,266
appropriate. So let's recentralize it in the level by resetting its

125
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:22,266
transform. We can then pull up the X size, until it covers the level.

126
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:26,266


127
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:30,266
Now it doesn't matter if it's a little bit larger than the level, that's fine, and we can just

128
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:34,266
reposition like that. I would overspill just a little bit. Then, I can work on

129
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:38,266
the Y size. Again, the same thing applies.

130
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:42,266
Cover the level, that's fine! And now, the Z size, I said I wanted it to cover these

131
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:46,266
boxes, etc. So let's just increase the Z size, repositioning it as we

132
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:50,266
do, to something like that. OK great! So using this multi-

133
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:54,266
view is handy for that! Now, let's have a look down here! You see, we have green on the top

134
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:58,266
of all of these surfaces, and we have a continuous or at least fairly

135
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:02,266
continuous Nav Mesh moving up here. I think that'll be OK! It looks a little

136
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:06,266
broken on the stairs there. If you want to improve that, what we could do is just turn the

137
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:10,266
Step Height down a little bit and then increase the Number of Steps,

138
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:14,266
maybe just by 1. And that should be enough to get a continous

139
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:18,266
volume. So I'm going to go with 26 or 28 Step Height, maybe,

140
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:22,266
and you can see here that the Nav Mesh is more continuous, going up the

141
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:26,266
side there. So great, take a screenshot of your area, perhaps

142
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:30,266
focusing on the stairs here. If you want to select all the faces of these and apply a default

143
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:34,266
material you can, I'm not going to bother right now. And I will see you in the next video!

00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,632
