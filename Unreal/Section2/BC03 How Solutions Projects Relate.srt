00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
...

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Welcome to how solutions and projects relate! So. in this video we'll be talking about

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
how a solution is a group of projects. One analogy I've

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
heard is. if a solution is like a house then a project is like a room in the house.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We'll be setting up a new command line project. We'll give you an overview

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
of the structure of our solution for this section. and in the case of Visual Studio.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
you're going to need to add a main.cpp source code file to our project.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
By the end of it. it'll look something like this. You'll have a second section right next

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to Section_01 nice and organized. and in there amongst other clutter.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
you'll have a bull cow game project folder and in that project folder you will

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.066
have your main.cpp source code file.

12
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:46.066
OK. so let''s dive in and get this section setup. and at the same time. let's

13
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:50.066
understand how folders for solutions in projects relate!

14
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.066
So. I'm going to go into Visual Studio. and I'm going to create myself a new project.

15
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:58.066
It's very similar in Xcode. Now. in Visual Studio. I'm looking for Visual C++

16
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:02.066
Win32 Console Application. That's where I should be in Visual Studio

17
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.066
If you're in Xcode then you're looking for this. OSX Application.

18
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.066
Application Command Line Tool. OK. that's on the slides! Great!

19
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.066
So. here in Xcode. when I give my project a name... I'm just going to call it Project

20
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:18.066
for now. You're welcome to follow along or you can wait until the challenge to do all of this. Then. it's

21
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:22.066
actually going to name the solution the same thing as the project. but I'm going to rename the solution

22
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:26.066
so that it's clear. So. my new project Name is Project and my Solution name is Solution.

23
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:30.066
This is my folder. I'm going to not create a Git repository

24
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:34.066
and click OK. Now. in Visual

25
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:38.066
Studio. you're going to be asked a few more questions. I'm going to select empty project and turn off

26
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.066
SDL. Now. remember this for your challenge. When it comes to your challenge. this is how you're

27
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:46.066
going to want to setup your application. You leave the top radio button by default. but we

28
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:50.066
select an empty project and we un-tick SDL. We basically make it as simple as we

29
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:54.066
can. Then. click finish. Right now. in the case of

30
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.066
Xcode. it will have actually setup a little more than it does in Visual Studio. In some ways.

31
00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:02.066
it will have created a main.cpp file. but we'll talk about that in a moment. Let's

32
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:06.066
just click and see what it's made. It's made a folder called Solution. which is our Solution Folder.

33
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:10.066
Inside that. we have a folder called Project. which

34
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:14.066
is our project folder. and then. we have a Project.vxproj. And

35
00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:18.066
in Xcode you'll have a very very similar setup but there'll be less files. and

36
00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:22.066
under Project you'll have Project dot xcodeproj.

37
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:26.300
OK fantastic! So. that's how it works! What I want you to do now is setup

38
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.066
the section proper. So. I'm going to go back and delete

39
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:34.066
the Solution Folder. because we just don't need and that was just a test.

40
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:38.066
And I'm going to give you your challenge slide! So. your challenge is as follows. Setting up

41
00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:42.066
your project. I want you to end up with this. Unreal

42
00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:46.066
Course or whatever you've called your folder that holds all your sections. Section

43
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:50.066
02. that's your section or solution sub-folder. In Visual Studio

44
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:54.066
it's called a solution and you'll have one solution per section. In Xcode

45
00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:58.066
well they really don't have the idea of solutions. so it's just a folder.

46
00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:02.066
Inside that Section_02 Folder we want a BullCowGame sub-folder. That's the

47
00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:06.066
Project Folder. and it should be automatically created by your IDE.

48
00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:10.066
And then. within that sub-folder you'll find BullCowGame.vcxproj or

49
00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:14.066
.xcodeproj. if you're in Xcode. Alright. so that's what I want

50
00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:18.066
you to end up with. And inside BullCowGame. as an extra

51
00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:22.066
challenge. on Visual Studio you're going to need to create yourself a main.cpp.

52
00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:26.066
You're going to need to just add a file to the solution. see if you can work out how to do it yourself.

53
00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:30.066
of type C++ and just call it main. It doesn't need any code in it for now

54
00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:34.066
but that's it. In Xcode. over on the Mac.

55
00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:38.066
you'll find that it's already done this for you. but in Visual Studio you're going to need to do the work. So.

56
00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:42.066
go ahead. pause the video! See if you can get all of that setup right now. It doesn't matter if you struggle. It doesn't matter if

57
00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:46.066
it takes a little while. This is good. because this is teaching you how to folder structure works.

58
00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:47.533
...

59
00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:51.533
Hey welcome back! So. the first part of this challenge is relatively straight forward. It's what I

60
00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:53.333
showed you before. We open our IDE.

61
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:57.333
By the way. if you're an Xcode user. skip to about 7 minutes and 20 seconds. and I'll

62
00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:59.833
be giving you different instructions there.

63
00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:03.833
We make a new project. We're going to go Win32

64
00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:07.833
Console Application or similarly in Xcode. as I showed you before.

65
00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:11.833
I'm going to call it BullCowGame. because that's the name of the project and the

66
00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:15.833
application that we are going to be making. But I'm going to rename

67
00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:19.833
the Solution of Section_02 for organization. I'm

68
00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:23.833
going to leave both of these... Well. you certainly want to create a directory for the solution. that's the whole

69
00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:27.833
point of naming the directory here. but I'm going to create a Git repository. If

70
00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:31.833
you don't know what that means. just leave it unchecked for now. it'll save some disk space. It's to do with Version

71
00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:35.833
Management and we're not doing that at this stage in the course. OK cool!

72
00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:39.833
So then. the settings I asked you to set was a Console Application. because that's what we're aiming at.

73
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:43.833
And then. I want an empty project with no SDL. Now. it doesn't matter what any of these things

74
00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:47.833
actually mean. The motivation here is. we want the simplest possible project. so it's empty

75
00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:51.833
and it has no clutter in the project. so we finish off.

76
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.833
Great! So. that part of the project is fairly straight forward. Let's see. we have a directory called Section_02.

77
00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:59.833
we have a sub-directory called BullCowGame. and inside it. we have a BullCowGame.vcxproj

78
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:03.833
or xcodeproj. Fantastic. so that's

79
00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:07.833
good! Now. we need this main.cpp file. If you're on Xcode.

80
00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:11.833
by the way. you can stop watching now and skip to the next video. because you'll already have it already done.

81
00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:15.833
But in Visual Studio there are some subtleties here. So. how do you get this

82
00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:19.833
main.cpp file added? Well. there are two ways. Really there's lots of ways but

83
00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:23.833
the easiest way is to click into

84
00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:27.833
the Project. So. this is the Solution here. which contains one project. That project

85
00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:31.833
is BullCowGame. You right-click on the project. and you can say Add. New Item.

86
00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:35.833
Alright. now the easiest way is to do that. so let's do that!

87
00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:39.833
Add. New Item. It's a C++ file and we're simply going to call it

88
00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:43.833
main.cpp.

89
00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:47.833
Oops. I'll get there in

90
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:51.833
the end! There we go. main.cpp. Add. Now. this does lots for us. If we

91
00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:55.833
look on the File System. there it is as planned! It's also attached as

92
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:59.833
a source file. a source code. to the

93
00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:03.833
Project OK. That's cool and we're done! That's the challenge

94
00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:07.833
finished! Now. there's another way you may have attempted this. and it will cause you a little problem.

95
00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:11.833
If you'd have gone New File. that's OK. And you may have said Visual C++

96
00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:15.833
and C++ File. very nice. And then.

97
00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:19.833
you may have put something in it. because otherwise you'll realize you can't save it until you've actually done something

98
00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:23.833
like maybe made and deleted a space. And then. there's a star. which means it's an unsaved

99
00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:27.833
file. Now. if you go File and Save or Save All.

100
00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:31.833
it'll come up and say well. what do you want to call this guy and where do you want to put it? Well. now you've got to go work out where to put

101
00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:35.833
it. which is in Section_02 BullCowGame. next to the main.cpp.

102
00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:39.833
as a test. And you save it and you're still not

103
00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:43.833
done. because look. it's not actually a part of the project. You see project force

104
00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:47.833
files don't include it! That's a pain right! So. there are several ways you can get

105
00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:51.833
it there. but one is that you could go Add. Existing Item. go and find

106
00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:55.833
it. and finally it's connected in part of your solution. So. I'm actually

107
00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:59.833
going to delete test. we don't need it. Remove. by right-clicking

108
00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:03.833
and then Delete. and it's going to delete it off the Disk. But you see that by

109
00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:07.833
far. the easiest way is to right-click the project. Add.

110
00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:11.833
New Item. That does it all for us. That's it! So congratulations

111
00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:15.833
you are setup! I think you understand that a solution is a container for one or more projects.

112
00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:19.833
Our project is called BullCowGame. Our Solution Folder is called

113
00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:23.600
Section_02 here. and we are good to start coding!

114
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.600
So. the rest of this video is just for Xcode users. If you're on Visual Studio.

115
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.600
we're finished. just skip to the next video. So. here in Xcode on a Mac. you want to

116
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.600
create a new Xcode project. You want to choose the

117
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.600
OS X section and then Application and Command Line Tool and

118
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.600
click Next. So. the project name is going to be BullCowGame.

119
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.600
And we don't have

120
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.600
a concept of solutions here. we're just going to use a folder for solutions

121
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.600
in Xcode. Just put a name in for your Organization

122
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.600
Name and an Identifier as a single word. It doesn't really matter what you put here. but it does

123
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.600
matter that you choose C++ as the language. Click Next!

124
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.600
So. this is my UnrealCourse Folder. empty here. In there.

125
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.600
I'm going to create what I'm calling a Solution Folder over in Visual Studio. but as far as Xcode is concerned.

126
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.600
it's just a folder to organize things. and this is section 02.

127
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.600
And then. once I have Section_02 selected here.

128
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.600
I click Create. Then. my main.cpp file

129
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.600
ends up in Downloads. In my case. UnrealCourse. Section_02. BullCowGame.

130
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.600
BullCowGame again. main.cpp. That's the folder

131
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.600
that we end up in. And here is your main.cpp file! We don't even need

132
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.600
to create one in Xcode. it's as simple as that! So. that's it!

133
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.600
We just want to quit Xcode. If you want to re-open that. you go to

134
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.600
Downloads. Unreal Course. Section_02. BullCowGame. and just go

135
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.600
and open the dot Xcode proj file. And that will take you back to where we

136
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.600
just were. Great! Congratulations and I'll see you soon!

137
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.833
=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to how solutions and projects relate! So, in this video we'll be talking about

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
how a solution is a group of projects. One analogy I've

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
heard is, if a solution is like a house then a project is like a room in the house.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll be setting up a new command line project. We'll give you an overview

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
of the structure of our solution for this section, and in the case of Visual Studio,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you're going to need to add a main.cpp source code file to our project.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
By the end of it, it'll look something like this. You'll have a second section right next

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to Section_01 nice and organized, and in there amongst other clutter,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
you'll have a bull cow game project folder and in that project folder you will

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,066
have your main.cpp source code file.

12
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:46,066
OK, so let''s dive in and get this section setup, and at the same time, let's

13
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:50,066
understand how folders for solutions in projects relate!

14
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:54,066
So, I'm going to go into Visual Studio, and I'm going to create myself a new project.

15
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,066
It's very similar in Xcode. Now, in Visual Studio, I'm looking for Visual C++

16
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:02,066
Win32 Console Application. That's where I should be in Visual Studio

17
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:06,066
If you're in Xcode then you're looking for this, OSX Application,

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,066
Application Command Line Tool. OK, that's on the slides! Great!

19
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:14,066
So, here in Xcode, when I give my project a name... I'm just going to call it Project

20
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:18,066
for now. You're welcome to follow along or you can wait until the challenge to do all of this. Then, it's

21
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:22,066
actually going to name the solution the same thing as the project, but I'm going to rename the solution

22
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:26,066
so that it's clear. So, my new project Name is Project and my Solution name is Solution.

23
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:30,066
This is my folder. I'm going to not create a Git repository

24
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:34,066
and click OK. Now, in Visual

25
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:38,066
Studio, you're going to be asked a few more questions. I'm going to select empty project and turn off

26
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:42,066
SDL. Now, remember this for your challenge. When it comes to your challenge, this is how you're

27
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:46,066
going to want to setup your application. You leave the top radio button by default, but we

28
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:50,066
select an empty project and we un-tick SDL. We basically make it as simple as we

29
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:54,066
can. Then, click finish. Right now, in the case of

30
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:58,066
Xcode, it will have actually setup a little more than it does in Visual Studio. In some ways,

31
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:02,066
it will have created a main.cpp file, but we'll talk about that in a moment. Let's

32
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:06,066
just click and see what it's made. It's made a folder called Solution, which is our Solution Folder.

33
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:10,066
Inside that, we have a folder called Project, which

34
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:14,066
is our project folder, and then, we have a Project.vxproj. And

35
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:18,066
in Xcode you'll have a very very similar setup but there'll be less files, and

36
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:22,066
under Project you'll have Project dot xcodeproj.

37
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:26,300
OK fantastic! So, that's how it works! What I want you to do now is setup

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,066
the section proper. So, I'm going to go back and delete

39
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:34,066
the Solution Folder, because we just don't need and that was just a test.

40
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:38,066
And I'm going to give you your challenge slide! So, your challenge is as follows. Setting up

41
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:42,066
your project. I want you to end up with this. Unreal

42
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:46,066
Course or whatever you've called your folder that holds all your sections. Section

43
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:50,066
02, that's your section or solution sub-folder. In Visual Studio

44
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:54,066
it's called a solution and you'll have one solution per section. In Xcode

45
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:58,066
well they really don't have the idea of solutions, so it's just a folder.

46
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:02,066
Inside that Section_02 Folder we want a BullCowGame sub-folder. That's the

47
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:06,066
Project Folder, and it should be automatically created by your IDE.

48
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:10,066
And then, within that sub-folder you'll find BullCowGame.vcxproj or

49
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:14,066
.xcodeproj, if you're in Xcode. Alright, so that's what I want

50
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:18,066
you to end up with. And inside BullCowGame, as an extra

51
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,066
challenge, on Visual Studio you're going to need to create yourself a main.cpp.

52
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:26,066
You're going to need to just add a file to the solution, see if you can work out how to do it yourself,

53
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:30,066
of type C++ and just call it main. It doesn't need any code in it for now

54
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:34,066
but that's it. In Xcode, over on the Mac,

55
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:38,066
you'll find that it's already done this for you, but in Visual Studio you're going to need to do the work. So,

56
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:42,066
go ahead, pause the video! See if you can get all of that setup right now. It doesn't matter if you struggle. It doesn't matter if

57
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:46,066
it takes a little while. This is good, because this is teaching you how to folder structure works.

58
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,533
...

59
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,533
Hey welcome back! So, the first part of this challenge is relatively straight forward. It's what I

60
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,333
showed you before. We open our IDE.

61
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,333
By the way, if you're an Xcode user, skip to about 7 minutes and 20 seconds, and I'll

62
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,833
be giving you different instructions there.

63
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:03,833
We make a new project. We're going to go Win32

64
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,833
Console Application or similarly in Xcode, as I showed you before.

65
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,833
I'm going to call it BullCowGame, because that's the name of the project and the

66
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,833
application that we are going to be making. But I'm going to rename

67
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,833
the Solution of Section_02 for organization. I'm

68
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,833
going to leave both of these... Well, you certainly want to create a directory for the solution, that's the whole

69
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,833
point of naming the directory here, but I'm going to create a Git repository. If

70
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,833
you don't know what that means, just leave it unchecked for now, it'll save some disk space. It's to do with Version

71
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,833
Management and we're not doing that at this stage in the course. OK cool!

72
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,833
So then, the settings I asked you to set was a Console Application, because that's what we're aiming at.

73
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:43,833
And then, I want an empty project with no SDL. Now, it doesn't matter what any of these things

74
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,833
actually mean. The motivation here is, we want the simplest possible project, so it's empty

75
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,833
and it has no clutter in the project, so we finish off.

76
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,833
Great! So, that part of the project is fairly straight forward. Let's see, we have a directory called Section_02,

77
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,833
we have a sub-directory called BullCowGame, and inside it, we have a BullCowGame.vcxproj

78
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,833
or xcodeproj. Fantastic, so that's

79
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,833
good! Now, we need this main.cpp file. If you're on Xcode,

80
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,833
by the way, you can stop watching now and skip to the next video, because you'll already have it already done.

81
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,833
But in Visual Studio there are some subtleties here. So, how do you get this

82
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,833
main.cpp file added? Well, there are two ways. Really there's lots of ways but

83
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,833
the easiest way is to click into

84
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,833
the Project. So, this is the Solution here, which contains one project. That project

85
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,833
is BullCowGame. You right-click on the project, and you can say Add, New Item.

86
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,833
Alright, now the easiest way is to do that, so let's do that!

87
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,833
Add, New Item. It's a C++ file and we're simply going to call it

88
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,833
main.cpp.

89
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Oops, I'll get there in

90
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,833
the end! There we go, main.cpp. Add. Now, this does lots for us. If we

91
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,833
look on the File System, there it is as planned! It's also attached as

92
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,833
a source file, a source code, to the

93
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,833
Project OK. That's cool and we're done! That's the challenge

94
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,833
finished! Now, there's another way you may have attempted this, and it will cause you a little problem.

95
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,833
If you'd have gone New File, that's OK. And you may have said Visual C++

96
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,833
and C++ File, very nice. And then,

97
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,833
you may have put something in it, because otherwise you'll realize you can't save it until you've actually done something

98
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,833
like maybe made and deleted a space. And then, there's a star, which means it's an unsaved

99
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,833
file. Now, if you go File and Save or Save All,

100
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,833
it'll come up and say well, what do you want to call this guy and where do you want to put it? Well, now you've got to go work out where to put

101
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,833
it, which is in Section_02 BullCowGame, next to the main.cpp,

102
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,833
as a test. And you save it and you're still not

103
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,833
done, because look, it's not actually a part of the project. You see project force

104
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,833
files don't include it! That's a pain right! So, there are several ways you can get

105
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,833
it there, but one is that you could go Add, Existing Item, go and find

106
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,833
it, and finally it's connected in part of your solution. So, I'm actually

107
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,833
going to delete test, we don't need it. Remove, by right-clicking

108
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,833
and then Delete, and it's going to delete it off the Disk. But you see that by

109
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:07,833
far, the easiest way is to right-click the project, Add,

110
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,833
New Item. That does it all for us. That's it! So congratulations

111
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,833
you are setup! I think you understand that a solution is a container for one or more projects.

112
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,833
Our project is called BullCowGame. Our Solution Folder is called

113
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,600
Section_02 here, and we are good to start coding!

114
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,600
So, the rest of this video is just for Xcode users. If you're on Visual Studio,

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,600
we're finished, just skip to the next video. So, here in Xcode on a Mac, you want to

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
create a new Xcode project. You want to choose the

117
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,600
OS X section and then Application and Command Line Tool and

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
click Next. So, the project name is going to be BullCowGame.

119
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,600
And we don't have

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,600
a concept of solutions here, we're just going to use a folder for solutions

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,600
in Xcode. Just put a name in for your Organization

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Name and an Identifier as a single word. It doesn't really matter what you put here, but it does

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,600
matter that you choose C++ as the language. Click Next!

124
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,600
So, this is my UnrealCourse Folder, empty here. In there,

125
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm going to create what I'm calling a Solution Folder over in Visual Studio, but as far as Xcode is concerned,

126
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,600
it's just a folder to organize things, and this is section 02.

127
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,600
And then, once I have Section_02 selected here,

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I click Create. Then, my main.cpp file

129
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
ends up in Downloads. In my case, UnrealCourse, Section_02, BullCowGame,

130
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,600
BullCowGame again, main.cpp. That's the folder

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,600
that we end up in. And here is your main.cpp file! We don't even need

132
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,600
to create one in Xcode, it's as simple as that! So, that's it!

133
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,600
We just want to quit Xcode. If you want to re-open that, you go to

134
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Downloads, Unreal Course, Section_02, BullCowGame, and just go

135
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
and open the dot Xcode proj file. And that will take you back to where we

136
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,600
just were. Great! Congratulations and I'll see you soon!

137
