
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So welcome to Simplifying with Functions! In this

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
video we are going to talk about the fact that programming

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is all about managing complexity. We want to think about as few

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
things at a time as possible. We'll talk about the idea of abstraction

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and encapsulation. We'll discuss how functions help us simplify

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
things. You'll write and call your own functions.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll have a warning about the side effects of functions, as they're called

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and why we always use return at the end of your functions. I'm going to

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
let you make a mistake in the first challenge. Oh no, now I've told you, I've given the game away, and you

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
may not make the mistake! [Laughs] OK let's dive in and take a look at this!

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So looking at my code right now, I'm not

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
entirely happy, because I'm starting to what I call lose the wood for the trees. There's just too much

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
stuff on the screen to look at, so we want to start

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
managing this complexity, so a word on that firstly

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Abstraction and encapsulation, big words and you'll see them on

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
smart answers on Stack Overflow. So let me just give you my take on this!

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Firstly, I would say that a major goal in writing software is to manage complexity.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Right a big piece of software is very complex, and we can only keep a

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
certain number of things in our brains at once, so we want to manage that complexity down.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We don't want to be too clever actually, we want to make sure that a future version of ourselves

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
or somebody else coming on and seeing our code can easily see what's going on, and that's

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
hard making things that clear and simple. So abstraction is

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
a technique for managing complexity, by considering things at a higher level.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
For example, the lines of code that print the introduction,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
as a whole, could be called print introduction. We've kind of

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
got it in the "// introduce the game" comment, but we actually want the comments to almost

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
disappear into the code, self documenting code, so we'll see how that works in a minute.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So then, encapsulation is a way of making sure your abstractions are adhered to.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So concretely, once we've decided that this is the way we introduce the game,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we can wrap that functionality off into a function and call that function

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and it'll introduce the game for us, then there's only one way to introduce the game

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and we get very consistent behavior. So enough talking, let's do it! We've

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
already got the right code highlighted. If I cut that code with Control X,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and then, I'm going to go and paste it into this new method that we talked about. Now

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
don't keep things in your copy buffer for too long, so I'd probably paste it straight

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
away. And then, wrap the code around it, because you could lose it couldn't you? You can always use

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Control Z and stuff, you're not amateurs. Anyway, what are we going to call this method?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We're introducing the game, so Print

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Intro() will do fine.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OK fantastic! PrintIntro(), so now curly braces!  Need

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to put one curly brace at the bottom, and then, when you do so, it's helpfully indented. But if it

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
hasn't indented, for any reason, this is how you want to end up alright.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So that's a function that takes in no parameters and passes nothing back, but

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
even though we're passing nothing back, I still want you to be in the habit, at the bottom, of saying

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
return. We're not returning anything because it's void, which means

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that we're returning nothing, but it's a very important habit, otherwise you can start to forget to return things.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So what's the point of this PrintIntro()? It's to introduce the game.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And it's got its WORD_LENGTH with it, if you click on that it shows you where the

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
other instances are. By the way, let's just have a quick check and make sure we haven't used WORD_LENGTH anywhere

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
else, because WORD_LENGTH is only going to be available now

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
inside PrintIntro(). That's actually a good thing, it means the scope,

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the width of our code within which we can actually

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
use it, is limited to just what we're seeing there, in fact, right inside

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
here. So we create WORD_LENGTH there, we use it very very soon after,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and then, as soon as we leave this function it goes, what we call out of scope and it's

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
not available to anything else. In fact, if you come into main() here and start trying to type WORD_LENGTH

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
it doesn't come in the autocomplete. Alright, that's called scope and it's a good

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
thing. It's to do with encapsulation, it's making sure we can't get

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
hold of this where we don't need it. Now later, we will need to move it  to a different scope but for now

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
this is fine. So PrintIntro() and in the main() what we do is we

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
just go PrintIntro(). Great, let's make sure

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that works! So we've tidied up the beginning by saying PrintIntro(), look how much tidier

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
main() is now. And it works, it prints the

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
intro! Now, there's something else I want to tell you before we move on! The second part of this is, I want to see

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
main(). In fact, what is main()? Let's comment to say what main is. This is "// the entry

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
point for our application"

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
or something. If you ever feel you need to describe something, do so.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I want PrintIntro() to be up underneath this, so let's cut it and put it

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
underneath, but we get a problem! Let's try compiling! Control F5,

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it doesn't work, "identifier not found"

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
on line 11. So line 11 tries to use

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
PrintIntro(), it doesn't understand it. What we need to do here is take this part of

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
void PrintIntro() and put it at the top like that,

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
with a semicolon. Why a semicolon? Because if we try and put a pair of curly

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
braces, which by the way act as another way of completing

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the statement. Look at main(), for example, it doesn't have a semicolon on the end and neither does Print

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Intro(). Yeah, but if we try and just leave curly braces

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
or even curly braces and a semicolon or something, it's going to say no it

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
already has a body. So the curly braces are the implementation of

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
this, and we don't want to define the implementation in two places, really important.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So we say, void PrintIntro(), rather, with a semicolon on the end,

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and if we click on it you can see that it also exists there and that the implementation is at the

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
bottom. OK we want to keep our main() function at the top, because when you first come into this you want to say:

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
what's it doing? Well this is the entry point for our application OK, and

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
what else is happening? And then, we print an intro. Well how does PrintIntro() work? You look down

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
here, it does this stuff. You see how it simplifies? OK let's check it runs!

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It does, good good! OK,

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
now next thing! We want to put this stuff here into a method of its own, and

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
guess what? That's going to be a challenge for you! I want you to

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
write string GetGuess() as a function. Save your code so you can go

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
back, in case you mess things up. Write a function to get the guess,

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
return it as a string, at the bottom of the function, and restore your code to

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
its former working glory. Have a go, let yourself struggle with it a bit, but not too much.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If it takes you more than 15 minutes, 20 minutes, something like that, then watch my solution and

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
don't feel bad. Otherwise have a good go, have a look and see if you can do it by pattern matching

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and just by sheer determination and by checking on the web if you need to.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Whatever you need, see if you can get it done. It's a useful problem to be able to solve, and it's using things you've

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
already learned. OK welcome back!

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So I'm going to take all this code here, and I'm just going to

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
put it in a method called string GetGuess(),

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and it takes in no parameters and that's the

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
code. Alright, so it's going to get a guess from the player. In fact, I'm going to move that comment

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
up above like that, because it describes what the whole function does. And I guess,

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
for consistency, I can do the same with PrintIntro().

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
OK so PrintIntro() very simply does

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
that, GetGuess() from player does that. Great! See how "Enter your guess: ", it

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
defines it just as late as it needs to and repeats the guess back to them. Now warning

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
sign, this doesn't just get the guess at the moment. This more than gets

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the guess, it gets the guess and it prints the guess

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
back to them. I'm going to rename that "// print the guess back".

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hmm, not very good! This is what you call a side effect! If

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
you were up here now, let's see it in action, and I just put Get

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Guess(), that's my function call. So we'd GetGuess().

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't need this second load of code here. Look how simple

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
our main() method is now! We print an intro and get a guess. Let's make sure it works, then I'll talk about this

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
side effect. OK " 'GetGuess()':" " not found",

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that's because I need to put a prototype of GetGuess() at the top.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now this stuff at the top is starting to become the kind of contract,

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
an overview of what we're going to be doing, and later this will be in something called a header file.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But anyway, for now, we just need to make it available like that. Let's run it and see if it works!

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
OK " 'GetGuess': must return a value"!

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I've made the mistake I told you not to make, return

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Guess; so now we're returning a string. Enter you guess,

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
define yourself a variable called Guess,

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
use this getline() method, and then, let's have a space and say that we print

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the guess back. OK let's check it works, and then, we will talk about side-effects.  Test,

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
your guess was test. Fantastic! Look at the win here is the

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
simplicity of main(), but reading main(), it prints the intro

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and then it gets the guess. Hmm OK, and then you look at that and you

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
look at this, and you say, well there's a guess coming back as a string but I don't see anything.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The real problem, the side-effect, is that its printing. It shouldn't be printing

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
when it's just called GetGuess(). That's a bit nasty, so

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
we're going to own up to our mistake by renaming the method to say exactly what it does do.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now you can do that by renaming it in all three places it exists or

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
clicking on it and going Control R once, and it's going to show,

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
waiting for a second chord, Control R again. You could say

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
GetGuessAndPrint

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Back. In fact, that's what we'll do for now. And when you hit Return it'll say,

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
where do you want to replace this? You can pretty much trust it, if you had it selected right in the first place and it will

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
rename it there and where you call it and in the prototype at the top there.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Now this is what it does, this is a horrible method name, or method is another

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
word for function, is another word for routine, and they all have slight

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
subtleties as to what they actually are, but, for now, let's get used to all of the different ways of calling it.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
GetGuessAndPrintBack() does a lot and that's a bad thing that

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
it does so much but at least we're honest about what it does, we have declared the side-

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
effect and we're going to leave it like this for this video. So all I want to do now is

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
do it twice. Now the structure of main() is it

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Prints the Intro, GetGuessAndPrintBack(), GetGuessAndPrintBack(),

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and then it leaves a space and exits. Let's have a look at this work!

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Donkey... No "doinke" spoot! That'll do! And that

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
worked, and second guess "hello". Now we might want an extra space,

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
but look, let's leave the formatting, it works! And the big big win

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
is that main() is easy to understand and reads in

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
English now. So in the next video, we'll start looking at how we can do things

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
multiple times automatically, using loops, and we'll also look, in future videos, at

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
how we can make this method more single purposed. GetGuessAndPrintBack()

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
is not a nice method, because it's doing two things. OK fantastic! We'll see you soon!

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
...

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,833
...
