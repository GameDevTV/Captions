
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So clarity,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
it's worth fighting for, and that's what this video is all about. It's about making that

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
extra effort to reel this code in, as in reeling in a

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
fish on a fishing line, and bringing it back so that it looks almost too

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
simple, so we're ready to add more complexity in the next step.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I just want to explain something to you. Firstly, we're going to end up with a main() method that looks as simple as

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
this, and there'll be some improvements further down, which I won't spoil your challenges by showing you.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I also want to tell you that, if you want to do your own code thing and you're concerned that

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you know, you do the challenge you do your own code, and then I come along and show you a solution.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you feel like you have to change your code to match my solution, it's up to you whether you

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
do or don't. If you diverge from my solution and somehow your code stops working,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then you can always do the following. You can go to www.github.com/

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
UnrealCourse. OK, even if you're not logged in, in fact, I'm not

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
logged in here, and then, you can look for the section. This is section 2 BullCowGame,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and then, what you can do is you can make sure you're on the master branch. It should be

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the only branch there. And look for this word here, 9 commits, and that means, at the

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
time of recording there are 9 lectures and there are the lectures in the commit list.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
OK, so as a recap we're at github.com/UnrealCourse, then the section

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
name, commits, master. And then, if you go to a particular video, say this one

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
here, you can click, browse the repository at that point. Now, there's two things you can do. You're going to

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
either just kind of click in and look at the code at that stage, and you can even copy and paste it,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
or when you're at this level here and you've found

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the commit that you want, so let's go back another one to here.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then, you can download .zip, if you want, and replace your whole project.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, I just want to explain that, that's a possibility for you, if you want to do your own code, but if you're

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
concerned rather, you diverge and you can't keep track, well, you can always come in

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and compare against my code or even just download it and pick up from where I left off.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,833
...

29
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,833
So, at this stage if you're a beginner, we learned just enough to be dangerous! We've

30
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,833
just learned about enough things to create a real mess

31
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,833
and a mess we have. Here in the main() loop, this is what

32
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,833
I call a mess. Now, why is it a mess? It looks simple enough, but the problem with it is it's not a

33
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,833
consistant level or abstraction. PrintInfo() is higher

34
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,833
level than what's below. PrintInfo() is asking you to

35
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,833
do several things in one go, this stuff here which is simple and self contained

36
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,833
and well explained and has no nasty side effects. It does what it says and nothing else.

37
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,833
And we can sit here and look at PrintInfo(), and we can go yep, I'm happy with that. I don't need to look

38
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,833
at the details I know what it does. That's what we want! Then, you come down here and we've

39
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,833
got an implementation that's right down at the detail level. Look we've got

40
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,833
the things in here, ones and you know iterators, and stuff

41
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,833
right. And that's all fine and that needs to be somewhere, but we don't want it here, when

42
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:44,833
one minute we're thinking about printing a whole introduction section and then, we're talking about the details of the

43
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,833
loop. It's inconsistent abstraction. So, what I want to do, firstly,

44
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,833
is tidy this loop up so that it goes PrintIntro(),

45
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,833
play the game, and well that's it for the moment!

46
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,833
So, this bit here basically represents play game, doesn't it? It plays a single game.

47
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,833
So, how would we abstract this function. Well, we've done this before, but I want to show you Visual

48
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,833
Basic's tool, and then, I want to show you a nasty side effect and hence why

49
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,833
we won't use its tool for now and then later on we'll start using the tool again, because I think

50
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,833
that some of you are going to be experimenting and using the tool, so I may as well show you what happens when you to do that,

51
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,833
and we'll start learning about header files and we'll get our first view of them. OK, so highlight your

52
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,833
code, in here, the stuff that actually is responsible for playing the game. You can right click

53
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:28,866
or do Control and +, and you've got a quick action here.

54
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,366
Inside there you've got Extract Function,

55
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:35,366
so if for any reason you don't see that option go to Tools and Options, bringing up this

56
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:39,366
dialog box and down to Text Editor, C++,

57
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:43,366
Experimental, and then, you want to look under Refactoring for Enable

58
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:46,433
Extract Function. Set that to True and say OK.

59
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:50,433
It's quite powerful, it does various checks and things for you. it's done some checks, it thinks it's

60
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:54,433
possible to extract that, and now, let's give it a name: PlayGame,

61
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:58,433
and then just hit return. OK, now the main method has

62
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:02,433
got a lot simpler. Look, PrintIntro(); PlayGame();

63
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:06,433
return 0; so, i.e. "// exit the application". We can put that in!

64
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:10,433
OK, let's try!

65
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:14,433
[Sings] La di da di da di da! And then it exits. Great it works!

66
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:18,433
Now fantastic! It's done a lot for you! Where has it put PlayGame()? It's put

67
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:22,433
the details of PlayGame() down here. It's literally cut and pasted our code and written the method name

68
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:26,433
for us and indented it for us, done a lot of work for us. It's not used quite our

69
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,433
formatting, and eventually we'll go into Visual Studio's Tool

70
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:34,433
Options and change the way that it does hanging braces. But look what else

71
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:38,433
it's done! It has not put a prototype! How come PlayGame() is working,

72
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:42,433
when it doesn't have a prototype? I said you have to have prototypes. Remember, PrintInfo() didn't work unless

73
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:46,433
we declared it above hmm but PlayGame() does. How come?

74
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:50,433
Well, it's sneakily created us a main.h header file

75
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:54,433
over here, if you look in your Solution Explorer. If you don't see that, go to View, Solution Explorer,

76
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:58,433
and it's simply put in there void PlayGame();. Don't worry about #pragma once, it basically

77
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:02,433
says only include this header file once. But void PlayGame(); has been

78
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:06,433
put in there, and then, remember what I said #include does? It just does a copy and paste.

79
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:10,433
Well, it's put a #include in, as well, naughty thing. It's put a #include "main.h",

80
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:14,433
and it's made in the "main.h" and then it's put void PlayGame() in there. OK, that's

81
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:18,433
all fun and cool, and we will be doing that in general, including in this section, using header

82
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:22,433
files. It's an integral part of C++. Yes, it's a bit more work, but it does have some

83
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:26,433
benefits, which we'll see later. But for now, we don't want it to do that, so if you do

84
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:30,433
use it's extract method like that I'm just going to, for simplicity, remove the

85
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:34,433
reference to the header file. I'll show you now that it doesn't work. You see it says it says " 'PlayGame': identifier

86
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:38,433
not found". Let's move this function prototype

87
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:42,433
up here, into... I'm going to put it

88
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:46,433
here. I'm going to put the methods or the functions in the order that we use them. PrintIntro(), PlayGame(), Get

89
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,433
GuessAndPrintBack(). So, the logical structure here is, we include the libraries we want,

90
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,433
we tell it what namespaces to use, and then, we go ahead and write all our function

91
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:58,433
prototypes, although later these will all be in a header file. And then, we get into our main() method.

92
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:02,433
OK, so I'm actually going to delete main.h, so I don't care whether I save

93
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:06,433
changes to it, because I'm going to right-click over in the Solution Explorer, remove it, and

94
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:10,433
delete it. OK, we just don't need it. Take control of the program, get

95
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:14,433
it to do what you want it to do! And I'm going to remove some spaces here and put some

96
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:18,433
extra spaces between my method, so this is really clear now.

97
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:22,433
We find the entry point for the application, we print an intro, play the game, and leave.

98
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:26,433
OK, that is pretty cool! [Sing] La di da di da! OK

99
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:30,433
good! So, there's one more thing we need to do here which is, we've had this side effect

100
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:34,433
hanging over us for a while. In fact, we've had it hanging over us, too long! Alright, so

101
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:38,433
you should be a little bit uncomfortable now that I said that

102
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:42,433
GetGuessAndPrintBack() has a side effect, and the side effect is that it prints here.

103
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:46,433
We declared that it has a side effect, immediately that we realized, which is good,

104
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:50,433
but better than that let's remove the side effect! We don't want a method like this or function doing

105
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:54,433
two different things. So of course, that's going to be a challenge for you!

106
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:58,433
I want you to remove the side effect, rename the GetGuessAndPrintBack() method, move the

107
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:02,433
offending code, test it all still works, and ask yourself when you

108
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:06,433
look at your code, are you happy or very happy even with how your code reads?

109
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,433
And why not share it in the discussions, if you're pleased with a section of your code.

110
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:14,433
OK, see you soon!

111
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,433
Alright, so GetGuessAndPrintBack! What's the problem with it? It's that it prints back,

112
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:22,433
so let's do Control, R. Control, R, again! That's not letting me rename

113
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:26,433
it there, so I'll go to another instance of it here. Control, R,

114
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:30,433
Control, R. There you go! I don't know why it was being silly! I just did Control, R

115
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:34,433
several times, until it allowed me to do a rename. I'm going to change it back to

116
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:38,433
GetGuess(). Great! So, inside

117
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:42,433
PlayGame() we go and get the guess. GetGuess(), I would rather GetGuess() was right

118
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:46,433
next to where PlayGame() is, so I'm actually going to move PlayGame() down

119
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,433
as a method. Here come down to

120
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:54,433
here, so that when I'm in PlayGame() I can see GetGuess(). it's just easier

121
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,433
for me. Now, we don't want to print the guess back there, so we take it out of GetGuess(). Now, look

122
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:02,433
suddenly GetGuess() is good! It's clear, returns a string,

123
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:06,433
tells you what it does, enter your guess, and it

124
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:10,433
uses the GetLine method and returns it. Perfect! So, inside PlayGame() what does this do? Where it loops

125
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,433
for the number of turns, asking for guesses, there's the number of turns.

126
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:18,433
OK good! So we get the guess and then we need to print it back. Now, the only

127
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:22,433
problem here is, it's only going to print back if we have a variable. So, you could go

128
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:26,433
string Guess =

129
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:30,433
" " blank. string, remember always when you declare something

130
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:34,433
you always then initialize it like this, give it a value. And then, we could say that

131
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:38,433
Guess = GetGuess(). Now, what's that about? That is taking

132
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:42,433
the return value from GetGuess() and putting it into =.

133
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:46,433
OK, so we can do it this way, or we can simply short circuit this Guess = nothing " "

134
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,433
Guess = that, because if we're immediately setting it to the value of

135
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:54,433
GetGuess(), why not just cut to the chase and just do

136
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,433
that. string Guess = GetGuess();

137
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:02,433
OK, so we go get the guess and we print it back. I don't think we even need that

138
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:06,433
comment. It's pretty obvious what it's doing here.

139
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:10,433
So that's it! So, I want to make sure now that I'm very happy with the

140
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:14,433
code, top to bottom. I'm happy with the spacing, I'm happy with the main() method

141
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:18,433
particularly, because it's really clear what it's doing. I'm very happy with what the intro does.

142
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,433
I may put another space between functions here, make my

143
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:26,433
brackets style consistent all the way through the

144
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:30,433
program. So PlayGame(), it loops

145
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:34,433
around, it goes and gets the guess, it prints it out. OK, that's fine!

146
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:38,433
Now, is this a side effect? Not really, because part of playing the game is

147
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:42,433
asking for and giving feedback. Later, we won't just say what your guess was, of course, we'll be

148
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:46,433
counting bulls and cows, but I think that's OK. And I think that

149
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:50,433
all these methods now are clear. Let's just check it works! It's no good having

150
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:54,433
clear code if it doesn't work, by the way. So, one, two, three,

151
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:58,433
four, five. There you go!

152
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:02,433
Game works, code is good, and we are now good to move on

153
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:06,433
and think about the next level in our design. And it's now manageable again!

154
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:10,433
We've just got to keep reeling it in, every single time, bringing it back to manageable

155
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:14,433
and easy and simple. It should look almost too simple, that's what you

156
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:18,433
need, because in a minute we're going to come along and make it more complex again. OK, see you in a minute!

157
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,766
