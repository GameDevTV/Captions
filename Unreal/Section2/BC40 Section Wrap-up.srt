00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey. so huge congratulations on getting through

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
section 2. You've completed over 6 hours of content. you've done more than 30 challenges.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we haven't even really explored Unreal at all yet!

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is just the tip of the iceberg! So. I hope now that you feel

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
prepared for when we go into Unreal. that when we open up our

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
scripts that Unreal is going to provide us with. you've got enough understanding of C++

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that it's not going to scare you off for life. So. what I would

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
like you to do is. make sure you share your code with other students. That's really important!

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Improve the game. It would be great if you could just spend a little bit of time. right now. just

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
making a few little tweaks to the game. maybe providing a list of words.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Maybe allowing the user to select the word length. Whatever you like.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
just do something different to what I've taught you. because that initiative that

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
willingness to go that step further is going to make a lot of difference to you. And what we're going to do

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
next. in the next section. is take what we've built in terms of the Bull Cow

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Game class and it's header file. and actually build around that

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and modify that inside the engine and make a 3D

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
driven game inside Unreal. So. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the next section.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
My suggestion is that you start the next section right away.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and that way. you're more likely to come back and carry on swiftly.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.433
