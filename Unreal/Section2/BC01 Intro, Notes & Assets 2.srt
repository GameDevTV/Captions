1
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.966
So I'm so excited to actually start coding with you now! C++

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.466
is a fantastic language. but it can be a little bit daunting

3
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.966
to the newcomer. so I've desgined this section called Bulls &amp; Cows

4
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.466
to make it a gentle introduction. We're going to ignore all the

5
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.966
complexities of the Unreal Engine. by focusing on developing pure

6
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.466
C++ code in your IDE. Integrated Development

7
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.966
Environment. whether that's Visual Studio on the PC or Xcode on the

8
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.466
Mac. We're going to need to use those tools when we move into Unreal in section

9
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.966
3. so let's spend some time getting the difficult stuff out of

10
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.466
the way and learning to be really comfortable with C++ and really comfortable

11
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.066
with our tools. The game we're going to buid is Bulls &amp;

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000
Cows. and that is a word game. It's an adaption of the number game

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Bulls &amp; Cows. The idea is. the computer picks a word. In fact. there's

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000
just going to be one word in this version. And then. you hand the game over to a player.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.500
who has to try and guess what that word is. and the computer will

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.000
tell them when they get a bull. Think of bullseye. as when they get a perfect hit.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500
which is where their letter is the right letter in the right place.

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.000
or when they get a cow. which is where they've got one of those that is right but it's in wrong

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.500
place. So. Bulls &amp; Cows. letters in the right place

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.000
and letters that are in the word but they're in the wrong place.

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.500
And it's a surprisingly good and strategic game. especially when you've got a limited

22
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.000
number of moves. You really get the sense that you're running out of time to

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.500
guess what this word is. What are we going to be learning in this section? Well.

24
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.000
types. routines. loops. and even

25
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.500
classes. all the fundamentals basically that you need

26
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.000
to be able to go off and start writing C++ programs. Everything we'll learn through the rest

27
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.500
of the course is going to be icing on the cake. It's going to be further detail and further

28
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.000
programming tools. but with these basic constructs like being

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.500
able to define types like strings and variables

30
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.000
and enumerations and being able to

31
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.500
loop. to be able to choose where you go in the program and to be able to go around in circles.

32
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Conditionals. if statements. switch statements. With these basic tools.

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.500
you can do anything. and it's a great foundation for your programming.

34
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.000
So. we'll be following Unreal's coding style. We'll be doing a few

35
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.500
things to make sure that your code looks like the type of code that you're going to be making.

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.000
once we get inside Unreal in the next section. We're actually going to take our core

37
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.500
game class. that we build here. and we're going to move that into

38
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.000
the 3D game in the next section. so we're going to be reusing our code.

39
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.500
We'll be using Unreal's coding style. as I said. which is

40
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.000
by their documentation. which you can see by this link here. and

41
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.500
that is the Unreal coding standard. I'm going to adhere

42
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.000
to that as closely as I can. Attached to this lecture are notes

43
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.500
and resources. so you can download the

44
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.000
slide deck. You can even go to a URL. I'll just look it up for you.

45
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.500
It is bit.ly forward slash unreal

46
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.000
slides. and if you go there you;ll see a list of all the slides by section. And you can see

47
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.500
me create the slides live. actually. so that's a cool place to go! You can

48
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.000
download them as a .pdf. right here in the resources. Now remember. you can watch

49
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.500
the course offline on the iOS or Android App. And when

50
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000
I announce new videos. I'll be posting it into the Facebook group and

51
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.500
onto the Unreal course Twitter account. So. let's dive in

52
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.000
and start making C++ work for us!
