00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey, welcome

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to play-testing time! This is exciting, we're getting pretty close to shipping

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
our game! We're not really shipping it anywhere with this one, but still, it's a

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
fantastic run through! In this video, we're going to talk about how having someone else play-test

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
your game is vital. It's got to be a third party. Silently take notes, if you can

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or even record the screen if possible. Immediately go away and fix

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
obvious bugs, things that really should work that don't. But for improvements,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
do consider a second or third option, because one person's suggestion of an improvement

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
may be the next person's worst nightmare. Repeat until the bug

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
stroke issue rate plateaus. That means, keep trying it on different people

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
until the bug or issue rate plateaus. Now, realistically, with this simple game you really only

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.233
need to test it on one or two other people, but let's dive in and see how that's going to work.

13
00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:54.233
So, I want you to play-test the game. Find somebody else,

14
00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:58.233
Skype them if needed, do whatever it takes to find another person to

15
00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:02.233
play your game. You really need the perspective of a third party here, if at all

16
00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:06.233
possible. Worst case, zip up your project, your source code, and share it in the discussions, and ask

17
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.233
other students to play-test for you. And if you see another student asking for

18
00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:14.233
a play-test, please help them out by doing it. Share the bugs

19
00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:18.233
and improvements you find in the play-test, in the discussions. Make it

20
00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:22.233
clear which version you're commenting on. Is it your game, is it somebody else's game, or is it my

21
00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:26.233
game? And if you want to play-test my game, it would really help me.

22
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:30.233
Download it from there, github etc.

23
00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:34.233
Now, you can get hold of all of the lecture states from there, by the way, by

24
00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:38.233
going to Commits, but if you just click that link, that will take you directly

25
00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:42.233
to the download for the project in its latest state. So, go ahead, pause the video, and do some

26
00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:46.233
play-testing! Have fun!

27
00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:50.233
OK, welcome back! So, this is what I found from my

28
00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:54.233
play-testing actions, thanks to Lizzie my wife! We need to remove the new line,

29
00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:58.233
before the the BullCowCount, so that things are grouped together a little bit better. Let me

30
00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:02.233
show you that! So, when we type a word in, she's trying to guess

31
00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:06.233
what the word is. Say it's smart or something like that. It says "Please

32
00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:10.233
enter a 6 letter word." So, we say mall... I don't know,

33
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:14.233
plant, planes, or something. Now, and then we put another word in,

34
00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:18.233
planet. I'm being very unimaginative. Look you see

35
00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:22.233
it's not. It becomes quickly not that obvious which

36
00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:26.233
result the BullCowCount relates to, so I'm going to

37
00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:30.233
move this space between the BullCowCount and your guess, so at a glance, you can see what's

38
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:34.233
related to what. So, that's what that feedback means.

39
00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:38.233
What else have we got? Tell the user how many guesses they have.

40
00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:42.233
We don't know how many guesses we've got left there, so we need to do that!

41
00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:46.233
Our feedback was, it's all a bit "left brain", or whatever that means! [Laughs] We need some ASCII

42
00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:50.233
art or something like that in there. That's a good idea! And there's a spelling error! "Better luck next

43
00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:54.233
time!" at the bottom. So, let's dive in and get all those changes

44
00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:58.233
made. So firstly, this new line before the BullCowCount, where

45
00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:02.233
is that? Well, I think it's in here,

46
00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:06.233
in GetValidGuess. We put a new line

47
00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:10.233
in, just before the end of the while loop. I'm going to get rid of that new line, so

48
00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:14.233
it's not there every time, and then, I'm going to put a new line in

49
00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:18.233
after each specific error message, like this. A double new

50
00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:22.233
line, because that's really what's happening, we're doing new line twice. That's a bit more

51
00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:26.233
semantic or meaningful. Let's check this works! So,

52
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:30.233
hold on, I should be in Control, F5, not Debug Mode.

53
00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:34.233
"planets", "Please enter a 6 letter word." "planes",

54
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:38.233
Bulls, Cows, 5. OK, that's all good! Let's

55
00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:42.233
try another word, "planee". Please enter another word without repeating letters.

56
00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:46.233
Good! So, I think we've got the BullCowCount

57
00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:50.233
sitting next to the word very nicely. That's

58
00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:54.233
good! Alright, what was the next thing on the list? Tell the user how many guesses

59
00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:58.233
they have left! Hmm, yes so let's search for the word

60
00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:02.233
try, do a Control, F, try,

61
00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:06.233
and see if we can find where it says try. There you go!

62
00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:10.233
So, here we are inside GetValidGuess again,

63
00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:14.233
and we tell the user to try the CurrentTry.

64
00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:18.233
But what we want to do is we want to say try and then

65
00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:22.233
CurrentTry, and then something like this. " of "

66
00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:26.233
and then

67
00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.233
<< BCGame

68
00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:34.233
.GetMaxTries();

69
00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:38.233
and it's a method. And then, I'm going to use another line.

70
00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:42.233
" . Enter your

71
00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:46.233
guess:  "; Does that work? Try space something of something,

72
00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:50.233
full stop, ". Enter your guess: "; I think that should work! Let's try it!

73
00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:54.233
"Try 1 of 3" boom! We're still on 1 of

74
00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:58.233
3. Good! "planes". "Try 2 of 3" planes.

75
00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:02.233
"planet", OK cool! Obviously, I'm not

76
00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:06.233
playing this game properly for speed, in these videos. Great! So, the third thing was it's all a bit

77
00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:10.233
left a brain. We need some ASCII art, and there's a spelling error!

78
00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:14.233
Let me fix the spelling error, first. That's easy! "Better luck next time!" at the bottom. So, that's

79
00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:18.233
done, I don't even need to check that. Now, some ASCII art here, in the welcome.

80
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:22.233
Well, rather than going through and doing the ASCII art, I'm going to Cut

81
00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:26.233
and Paste the ASCII art in, and then, I'm just going to talk you through a few gotchas

82
00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:30.233
with doing ASCII art. So, I'm going to go get the ASCII art, from a previous

83
00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:34.233
Commit that I made over here, in my Version Control System. And I played

84
00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:38.233
around with this for some time, and that is all the

85
00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:42.233
text I came up with. So, let me come back to

86
00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:46.233
the project, and I think

87
00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:50.233
I need to replace all of that, if I've done it right.

88
00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:54.233
I think I over-replaced one line or two lines. Here we go, boom!

89
00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:58.233
OK fantastic! So, what we're doing now is we're entering

90
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:02.233
this as the ASCII art. Now, the things to think about with the ASCII

91
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:06.233
art, I'm using new lines at the start, some of the time, to space things out.

92
00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:10.233
You need to double... Where you want to backslash in your

93
00:06:10.233 --> 00:06:14.233
string, you need two backslashes, so that one escapes the other. You see where there are two backslashes

94
00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:18.233
here? There will only be one in my final result. Let's have a look! Here you go!

95
00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:22.233
"Welcome to Bulls and Cows, a fun word game." Well, clearly there are two of those, so I

96
00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:26.233
need to just remove that one. I pasted too much in. Let's try again!

97
00:06:26.233 --> 00:06:30.233
OK, "Welcome to Bulls and Cows, a fun word game." And look, here we go our bull!

98
00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:34.233
With all sorts of bull like features we want to not look to carefully and some horns,

99
00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:38.233
and then a cow with less bull like features.

100
00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:42.233
"Can you guess the 6 letter" word, and then, we can just go, I don't know,

101
00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:46.233
"planes". Let's just fail the game three times, play again,

102
00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:50.233
and then, it comes back. So, it's a really clear division between the games, and look it's got a

103
00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:54.233
little bit of spirit now, the game, a little bit of art to it. So,

104
00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:58.233
that's cool! In fact, that's it! That is all of the

105
00:06:58.233 --> 00:07:02.233
suggestions. So, I really want you to do your own ASCII art now,

106
00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:06.233
like this. I want to see your ASCII art! Remember, if you want to use a backslash, you've got to use to

107
00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:10.233
backslashes to get one. Use spaces, don't use tabs in here because

108
00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:14.233
tabs will not necessarily space out the same in the Console.

109
00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:18.233
That's really probably all I've got to tell you about it! So, go ahead, do that, please take

110
00:07:18.233 --> 00:07:22.233
a screenshot of your ASCII art, and share it! We want to share this graphically.

111
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:26.233
If you don't know how to take a screenshot, by the way, then a very simple cheap program in Jing,

112
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:30.233
TechSmith's Jing. And if you want a trade-up from Jing, you go as far as

113
00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:34.233
Snagit, which I use all the time. So, congratulations on getting this far!

114
00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:38.233
We're pretty much done! I'd love to hear your play-testing feedback

115
00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:42.233
in the discussions, as I said, and we'll see you for the final polishing

116
00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:45.166
and packaging video!
