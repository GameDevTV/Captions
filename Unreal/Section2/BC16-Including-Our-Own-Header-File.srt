00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
...

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So welcome to Including Our Own Header Files! In this video we'll be explaining

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
why you never use a namespace or use the keyword

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
using namespace in a dot header file. We'll actually stop using

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it all together. So over here in main.cpp. where we used to

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
have using namespace standard. we're going to get rid of that and show you the alternative.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We are going to create our first .cpp file that actually is

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
associated with the header file. so we'll have a FBCowGame.h. we should have already got.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but we'll also have the .cpp file with empty methods. And

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we'll talk about chains of includes. a little bit about #include. and how they work together.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So let's get on with it! So here we are

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
back at our merry code. and our first priority is to get rid of this error! The error

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is caused because it doesn't understand (string). So what we need to do is

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
#include something. Do you know what we need to #include? Well

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'll forgive you if you say iostream. but in this case. we need to be more specific

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and #include <string> itself. because that's

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
directly what we're trying to do. Now. how do I get (string) to work once I've done that?

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I go (std::string) instead. and

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
all is right with the world again. Let's just compile our code now

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and run it and make sure that it works. Good! So we're now in a state

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
where it runs. which is where we want to be most of the time. Now.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
what you do not do is. using

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
namespace inside a header file. If you do that and you include that

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
header file somewhere else. you're going to completely lose track of what namespaces you have access

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to. and you have open and that's a nightmare. In fact. it's such a nightmare

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that a lot of people advocate not using namespace at all. and I'm

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
going to suggest we stop using it. I used it the first time around to make your syntax look simpler

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and also to introduce you to it. because you're going to see it on the

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
web. you're going to see it in all sorts of places. when you do some searching. But we're going to get rid

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of it. because it's too dangerous. You're going to end up putting it in a header file one

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
day. You're better off just being completely explicit like this. And also. by the way. this

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
is much easier to search for. this is a very specific searchable thing inside your code.

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So what I want you to do is remove all references

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
to using namespace. which is only in your main.cpp

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
file. So go ahead and delete using namespace. When you do that your code

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is going to break. Try and do Control F5 now. you're going to get all sorts of

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
errors. starting with this string at the top. So let me show you

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
how to start sorting it out. then I'm going to challenge you to go and finish sorting it out. What you want to do is

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
go to string. go to Edit. Find and Replace.

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Quick Replace. That's one of the easiest ways. Control H remember that.

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And then. what we're going to do is. where we see string we're going to replace it with std::

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
string. OK. I'm going to skip over that first one.

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
If you look through. you can use this button I'm clicking on here to

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
go through the searches right. and then.

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
when it gets to the top it says it's finished starting. I'm not going to show that in the future. so I can comfortably

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
click through the whole lot now. So you can see the one that's highlighted

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in gray there. So I'm currently at this guy. and then. I'm going to use this button

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
here to replace. And it's saying it can't find anymore occurrences.

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
so you go next. You just have a quick preview of them all. and then. you say

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Replace All. OK. now of course. it may have done this one here.

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
which just is the only one that doesn't make sense. High. it's Sam here again just helping

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Ben out with a couple of the Mac bits of content. So I just wanted to

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
quickly show you how to do a find and replace in Xcode.

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So the trick here. it's Command F. or if you want to actually find the

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
menu. you can go into Find and then Find...

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
very helpful. And we want to do Find and Replace. so actually

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it's not Command F. it's Command Alt F like so. So we

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
want to search for "string". and we want to replace string with

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
standard string. so it's very straight forward. very much

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
like in VisualStudio. We can just click through to check that

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
everything is the one we want. and we can replace one by

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
one. like so.

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And we won't replace the top one. so if I save and build that should all be OK.

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Alright. so just checking that you haven't got double replacements.

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
because if you replace all that's basically how you do it. Let me do it slightly more competently

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the second time. Let's look down our file. look for the red dots over here. see where

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
it first complains again. It complains at cout. I'm going to use Control and H for

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
quick replace. I'm going to replace cout with std::

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
cout like that. and I'm going to boldly hit Replace All. Boom!

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
8 occurrences replaced. I'm going to have a look through and see if it's caused

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
me any complete nightmares. It hasn't and

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
there you go! We're just going to finish that off. look for the other things that don't work.

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
replace them. Pause the video. do that now. There's no challenge slide up and

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I'll come back to you in 2 seconds. Cool! Alright. so I'm just

75
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
going to finish this off with a few more Control H's. endl

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
endl. Replace All.

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
OK. so now it's found our endl's. What else has it got a concern about? It's done a

78
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
double replace there or I have. because I've been a fool. What else have

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
we got? OK. getline. let's do these ones manually. Standard getline also

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
cin itself. Alright. and here we go.

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Standard getline. standard cin.

82
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Great! Alright. let's recompile our code! Control F5.

83
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It all works now! OK. it came up. I put it away a but quickly but it all works. That's great

84
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
news! Now a little bit later on. I'm actually going to make a type substitution of

85
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
this to something else that we're going to see inside

86
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Unreal called fstring or ftext. so that we start to get even more used to

87
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Unreal syntax. Actually the situation will get better again. but

88
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
for now. let's go from having our eye in to the simple clean stuff.

89
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
that without to actually be able to train ourselves to read this as well. I want you

90
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to be as multitalented as possible. when it comes to reading C++. so that

91
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
when you need to go and dive online and say. how do I do this in C++. when you're making your own game.

92
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
you can read lots of different peoples' code. That's really important OK. it's not all sterile

93
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
code out there. This is actually much more strict. much more correct in many ways. It's just a

94
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
little bit more noisy. which is absolutely fine. Great! So what we need

95
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to do next is. we need to actually make ourselves a .cpp file

96
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and include this stuff. so that we can start implementing some of

97
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
these things that we have here. These greens are saying. it can't find a

98
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
definition for these things alright. So one simple way to

99
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
do that. by the way. would be to right click here and go to Quick Actions. I showed you before

100
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
how to enable that. from the Tools and Options menu if you need to.

101
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Create definition of it. Look what happens!

102
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It has already made you an FBullCowGame.cpp file. OK. it's

103
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
showing you a peak into that file. and then. you could open the file here by

104
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
double clicking in source. I like to have things ordered like this. main because

105
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
main is. well it's arguable where you put main. So

106
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
FBullCowGame.h first. for sure. because that thing gets pulled in here.

107
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
which main.cpp uses as well. Alright. so what we've

108
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
got now. what it's done for us. is this. It's #included "FBullCowGame.h"

109
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
but in quotes. You see because I said that if you're looking

110
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
for something on a standard library use chevrons. but if you're looking for something of your own you go

111
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
quotes. And it will help us autocomplete. And then it's

112
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
fleshed out. BullCowGame::Reset() method. and it has no

113
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
actual implementation right now. But if we go back to the header file.

114
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
close this little preview window. you can see over here

115
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that Reset() is no longer complaining. So I simply want you to finish writing

116
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
blank definitions. Write blank definitions for all the methods and ensure there are no warnings

117
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
left in the .h file. Welcome

118
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
back. This is a simple job thanks to these tools. In fact. I'm going to use Control and dot for the Quick

119
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Action. create a definition. and then. I'm just going to close it and trust it.

120
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm going to come down here. Control and dot. create definition.

121
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Close it and trust it. down here Control dot. create definition.

122
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
close it and trust it. Now we can go and look over here. Look it's done loads of work for us.

123
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
it's even returned the right things. The only thing it hasn't done is put a return at the end

124
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
of Reset(). and I want to return there. I said we should always think about

125
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
what we're going to be returning. even if it's nothing. Alright. so that's that! Now. one

126
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
question would be. where is... Oh. now GetMaxTries() is OK! Sorry! IsGameWon()

127
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. five methods! How many have we got

128
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
in here? 1. 2. 3. 4. so we're missing 1.

129
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Is it the IsGameWon()? GetMaxTries(). Reset(). GetMaxTries().

130
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
GetCurrentTry()... It's GetCurrentTry()! I don't know. to be honest. why it isn't

131
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
complaining about Get... Yes I do. ha ha ha! Look! Get

132
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
CurrentTry. it's not complaining here because it's not a method! I should've added brackets after

133
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
it! OK. so that's the problem. and

134
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
this what I've done here is. I've defined a variable and you can't implement a variable.

135
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So brackets. easy enough mistake to make! So right here.

136
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
create definition. and we're good to go! It doesn't matter if

137
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the order is the same in here. that's not important. but it has actually put it in order.

138
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So great! We've done a load of work there! We now have a file that has affectively.

139
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
once it's finished doing this #include. it's very much what we were doing in

140
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
main. We are defining these methods. just like we did here in main where we put

141
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
prototypes at the top here. The difference being here. we've wrapped it in something called a

142
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
class and said that these are public. Now. we'll understand a lot more about what that means later.

143
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
but well done in adding more skeleton to your code! And

144
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.433
we're doing really nicely here. so pat yourself on the back and I'll see you in the next video!
