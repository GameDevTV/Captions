1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
So, welcome to a quick tour of the Unreal Editor!

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
In this video we're going to create ourselves a basic C++

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
project, and then, we're going to add a couple of objects to the scene.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Make sure we understand how default scenes work, so that

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
next time you load Unreal you get the same stuff

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500
on the screen as you had before, scenes, levels, and

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
maps and all, basically interchangeable terms. And then, we're going to

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.500
have a play with the interface and customize it. You see my interface is looking a little

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
different. So, let's dive in and get that done now!

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
So, here we are back at the Epic Games

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Launcher! So hopefully by now your Unreal Engine has finished

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.500
downloading. If it hasn't, it'll be telling you here and slowly filling up

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.000
this logo with black, from the bottom to the top. Now, if you can't see any of

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
this, then firstly check here on the right tab. You may be on one of these other tabs along

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000
here. So, let's make sure we're on the UE4 tab and that we're in the Library

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.500
section of the UE4 tab, not the community section. Then, you

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.000
should see engine versions, and up here we have

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.500
4.10.1, or yours may be later than that and that's fine. As long as it's at

19
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
lest 4.10 we are good to go! So, let's launch Unreal

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.500
for the first time! You may get

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.000
a Windows Firewall warning here, when this opens. Now, by the way

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.500
I should say, if you're on a Mac I'm going to be covering the rest of the course on Windows, so

23
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.000
your going to have to fend for yourself in terms of the differences but their not huge.

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500
The differences are not particularly massive. So that's it! You can actually

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.000
close the Epic Games Launcher if you want. And we're at a screen like this! I just maximize it!

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500
Yours will be a lot smaller than this. As I said, I'm on a very low resolution.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
What we want to do firstly is select C++, not Blueprint.

28
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.500
These are just defaults, by the way. I mean any project can pretty much be turned into any

29
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
other, but we're just going to start with C++ basic code.

30
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.500
But I am going to turn the Starter Content here off, so No

31
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Starter Content. So, we want C++ at the top right, or select

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.500
it on this tab, Basic Code, these settings as default, but

33
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.000
No Starter Content just for simplicity. Pick yourself a sensible project

34
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500
folder. I suggest you put all of the sections under one folder and then

35
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.000
organize them nicely. I'm just going to call mine, Section_01.

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
You can have spaces, by the way, so _01. And I'm going to create the

37
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.000
project. So, the first time you do this, it'll take a little while. It depends on the

38
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.500
speed of your machine. Because your Compiler is already installed

39
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.000
and running, i.e. Visual Studio or Xcode, then

40
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.500
this code generation should go swimmingly. If you get any errors down here, then you need to

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.000
go back and watch the videos about installing your integrated development

42
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.500
environment. Because we've already done that, I'm hoping this bit will go without a hitch

43
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
for you, and that when it'll finish compiling your C++ source

44
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.500
code, it's basically building you your own version of the Unreal Editor,

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.000
which you could customize if you wanted to. But we're not going to be

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.500
doing that, certainly, at this stage. So, we let that happen and then

47
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.000
we're going to see what Unreal looks like on the inside and

48
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500
learn a little bit about saving and scenes

49
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.000
and how that all works. So scenes, you may hear the term level.

50
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.500
They're all the same type of idea. So, if it doesn't look like this for you, you can go

51
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.000
to the Window Menu, Reset Layout, and then OK.

52
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.500
So, it's Window, Layout, Reset Layout,

53
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.000
and then, OK, and when you do that it will

54
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.500
restart the editor and you'll be back to where we are. But I'm at the default, so I'll leave it as

55
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000
it is. Cool! So, let's do something very simple! Let's find the Modes

56
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.500
Window, which is Modes here. If you lose any of these things, you can always come

57
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.000
here to Window, and then have a look through and see if you can find

58
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.500
Modes, which is there, and turn it on. See that Modes is on the left-hand

59
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000
side. Let's go and find ourselves a basic, say cube, and just drag it and

60
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.500
drop it in the scene. You can move it with these arrows, up, down, left, right, etc.

61
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.000
And let's just save our project.

62
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.500
Now, when you click Save it's saying, save level as,

63
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.000
so the project name is Section_01. You see at the top here, it says Section_01,

64
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.500
but the level or the scene used

65
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.000
interchangeably is called Untitled, at the moment, and star means something has changed

66
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.500
on it. So, if we save, we're saving as it says the current level to disk. Let's

67
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.000
do that! Let's just call this Level_01. Now, I need

68
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.500
to maximize this, because I'm pushing the limits of

69
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000
resolution. I want it to be as low as possible, so you can see everything. Level01

70
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.500
OK. So I've saved that level. Let's go ahead and quit

71
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.000
the project altogether now, go back to the Epic Games Launcher

72
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.500
Library, and then, where it says My Projects, you'll see you have a

73
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.000
version 4.10 called section 1. Let's re-open it!

74
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.500
And let's see what happens when we re-open

75
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.000
this. Ahh! Where's my cube gone?! It's a

76
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.500
disaster, I can't see it! Now, it turns out that if you double

77
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.000
click Level01 that, of course, it will load Level01, but what's happening is it's not

78
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.500
loading Level01 by default. OK, so what we want to

79
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.000
do is change that, so that you know how to

80
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.500
control the level that it loads by default, and then, we'll make sure that

81
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.000
works in a challenge for you, in a moment. So, let me show you how to change it!

82
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.500
What we need to do is go up to the Edit Menu

83
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.000
and then Project Settings. So, Edit, Project

84
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.500
Settings, and in here we're going to have Maps &amp; Modes.

85
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.000
Now, levels, scenes, maps, you need to kind of consider those things all the

86
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.500
same. So, there we go! Now, Default Maps, Game

87
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.000
Default Map, but Editor Startup Map,

88
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.500
That's the challenge, is that it is the template default. When you start

89
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.000
the Editor it opens up a new blank map. That's fine! But if we want

90
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.500
to go back to the work we were working on, look you put the Down Arrow and then

91
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.000
Level01. So, there's a project level called Level01. Select that

92
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.500
and close and then close your project.

93
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.000
Let's try again! Simple stuff right, but this is the sort of thing

94
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.500
that will catch you out in Unreal, if you don't get it right from the beginning.

95
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.000
So, we come back here! Ahh, we have a cube! OK, I've got

96
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.500
a challenge for you! Here it is! I want you to add a second object to the

97
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.033
scene, save the scene, close the Unreal Editor, re-open it,

98
00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:46.533
and ensure the object is still there, and then, congratulate yourself that you have some

99
00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:50.033
semblance of control over the Unreal Engine. So go ahead, pause the video,

100
00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:53.533
and do that simple challenge, getting a second object from the Modes Panel,

101
00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:57.033
now.

102
00:05:57.033 --> 00:06:00.533
Welcome back! So, let's do this thing! I'm going to go to Modes, and I'm

103
00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:04.033
going to find, let's say a sphere. Let's stick a sphere on there, lift it up a bit,

104
00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:07.533
because it offends me sticking halfway through the floor. I'm going to save my scene

105
00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:11.033
level, App,

106
00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:14.533
whatever you want to call it. Double click back into my project, from the Epic Games

107
00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:18.033
Launcher and they're both there! So, Level01

108
00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:21.533
is now loading as the default. Simple stuff but we now

109
00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:25.033
know how to make sure our changes persist. Now, I want to talk to you quickly about

110
00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:28.533
the layout of the engine here. You can change a lot of things. If you're

111
00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:32.033
from Unity, for example, or you're on a very low screen

112
00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:35.533
resolution, you might want to move things around. So, you have little grippers

113
00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:39.033
here that you can move, and if you're careful then you can move

114
00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:42.533
where these things are but you need to understand how it works. So,

115
00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:46.033
have an experiment, because remember you can always go Reset Layout.

116
00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:49.533
So, I want you to start grabbing tabs, like the World Outliner and

117
00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:53.033
Details, and let's just move things around. I'm going to move it around

118
00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:56.533
to something I'm more familiar with, which is a Unity style. I'm going to lose Modes.

119
00:06:56.533 --> 00:07:00.033
I'm gong to put my World Outliner on the left hand side

120
00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:03.533
there. I'm going to leave the Content Browser

121
00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:07.033
where it is. Leave the Details where it is, that's equivalent to an

122
00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:10.533
Inspector, so if you click on something you see all it's details on the right.

123
00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:14.033
The World Outliner basically reflects all the things that are in this level

124
00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:17.533
here, so it's a one for one correspondence. You click something there you see it here.

125
00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:21.033
This is just like Unity, if you have any familiarity with that. If you don't and you don't

126
00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:24.533
even know what Unity is, don't worry. Unity is a different game engine that just...

127
00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:28.033
I'm reassuring you that this is fairly industry standard. Lots of these things work

128
00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:31.533
in a similar way, which is good. Alright, you can move your panes

129
00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:35.033
around, with the divisions in between them. And really, this is just a question of you

130
00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:38.533
experimenting. So go ahead, experiment with all of your panes and panels.

131
00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:42.033
If you have a very low resolution, like I do, then you may want to

132
00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:45.533
change things around a little bit. So, you can double click on this little

133
00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:49.033
yellow bit, at the top left, and that will give you a

134
00:07:49.033 --> 00:07:52.533
different type of handle, so that you can move things around OK.

135
00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:56.033
If you get into a complete mess like this, Window, Reset Layout,

136
00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:59.533
OK. And then, do we want to save

137
00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:03.033
the level? Well, sure that doesn't matter. If you're

138
00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:06.533
changing your layout, then it's going to say do you want to save the level before I go and reload the

139
00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:10.033
editor with a new layout. That's fine! Alright, so we're back to there! I'm

140
00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:13.533
just going to adjust mine a little bit to be Outliner on the left.

141
00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:17.033
I'm going to lose Modes, I'm going to detach this toolbar at the top,

142
00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:20.533
then drag it carefully. See it depends where you let to there.

143
00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:24.033
Then, the toolbar goes across the top, because i'm on such a low resolution. And

144
00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:27.533
this is a layout that I'm pretty comfortable with. I'm going to be able to see all the things in the toolbar

145
00:08:27.533 --> 00:08:31.033
I need. I've got plenty of room down on my details, on the right hand

146
00:08:31.033 --> 00:08:34.533
side and I'm good to go! Now, bear in mind you

147
00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:38.033
can also right click any tab and say Hide Tab, so we don't

148
00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:41.533
really need it saying World Outliner, etc. So, if we

149
00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:45.033
don't need that we can hide tab, and you can double click to show tab.

150
00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:48.533
So, that's up to you how you want to lay our screen out, alright. So,

151
00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:52.033
viewports. I, for now, am going to leave all these tabs on for me,

152
00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:55.533
apart from the toolbar, so that when I refer to things,

153
00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:59.033
I can guid you with my voice. I can say go to the World Outliner or go to the

154
00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:02.533
Content Browser or to the Details Tab, but just bear in mind

155
00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:06.033
you can right click on a tab and hide a tab like that, and then you can click at the top

156
00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:09.533
left, the yellow to resume. I think you've got the idea! You can now customize

157
00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:13.033
the Editor to your needs. When you've finished doing that, then just go to Window

158
00:09:13.033 --> 00:09:16.533
then Save Layout. And then, you only get one layout, but

159
00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:20.033
but you've saved your layout now. OK, so you've got a choice between you saved layout

160
00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:23.533
and to reset the layout back to the default. By the way, these windows can

161
00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:27.033
be detached completely and put in other places like this, a floating window.

162
00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:30.533
So there it is, floating! And if you want to get it back, well then just experiment

163
00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:34.033
or reset your layout. It's probably good to get in a bit of a mess,

164
00:09:34.033 --> 00:09:37.533
then to learn how to sort yourself out because that is all

165
00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:41.033
learning to command the interface. That's it, you have an introduction to Unreal! When you're happy

166
00:09:41.033 --> 00:09:44.533
with your layout, just quit altogether, and we'll see you in the next section!
