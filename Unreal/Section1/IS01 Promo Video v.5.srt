2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Would you like to learn to code from scratch and to do it the fun way by making

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
computer games in Unreal Engine, using C++ the industry standard

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
language? My name is Ben Tristem, I'm one of the top instructors here on Udemy!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
My game development courses have over 100,000 students and over

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
7,000 5 star reviews! This course was born as a Kickstarter that

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
funded over 1,000%. I'm the ideal person to help you tackle

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Unreal Engine in C++. So, how are we going to do this? We're going to start in the

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
first section with a game called Bulls & Cows. This is a fun and addictive

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
word guessing game. It's going to be focused purely on learning the basics

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of good coding practice and of C++, in your development

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
environment, without the distraction of the game engine at all. Then, we'll

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
move on to Building Escape. This simple yet incredibly

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
powerful game allows you to explore the basics of the Unreal Engine,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
without getting bogged down with unnecessary things. We get into how to build

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
levels of any size, how to import assets and customize

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,733
their materials, and then, very importantly how to make your C++ code change the behavior of the game.

18
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:12,733
And shipping right now we have Battle Tank, where you'll learn about menu systems,

19
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:16,733
you'll learn about composing much more complicated models, you'll be learning about

20
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:20,733
projectiles, particle effects, terrain, and

21
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:24,733
then having AI path-find around that terrain, and lots more detail

22
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,833
in control systems and much much more.

23
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:30,833
By the end of the course, you'll be really ready to start making simple Unreal Engine

24
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:34,833
games in C++, and you'll be much much more confident with coding than you ever

25
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:38,833
were. So, it's a great time to learn to code, and making games is just the

26
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,833
best way to do it, so please take this course now!
