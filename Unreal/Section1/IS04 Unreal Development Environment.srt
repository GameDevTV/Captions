00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Hi welcome back! So, in this video we're going to talk about the Unreal development

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
environment, a little more so you understand what it is. But

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
firstly, we're going to get the Unreal Editor actually downloading in the

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
background, even if Visual Studio or Xcode is still downloading. Let's get it

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
all downloading, so that we're not waiting because these things can take a while.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
So, see you in there!

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
So, regardless of whether your Visual Studio has finished downloading

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
or is still downloading, I want you to now go ahead and

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,000
download Unreal Engine in the background, as well, because

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,500
that's going to take a while. Then, we'll continue to talk about the whole

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,000
system and the whole architecture while that's downloading. So, what I want you to do is just

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
type into Google, "get

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,000
unreal", and where you're trying to go is just simply Unreal Engine.com.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Now, pretty much the moment you get there you're

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
going to be asked for an EPIC Account. You're going to need that, so if you've got

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,500
one sign in, and if you haven't got one, then sign up

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,000
for an Epic Account. And when you've done that, it will download

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,500
and installer, called the Epic Games Launcher.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,000
I want you to open that, and then try and install Unreal Engine

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,500
yourself. I want you to get a little bit responsible for doing your own things.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a pretty simple process. So, here's your challenge! This is your first challenge in the

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,500
course, is to start the Unreal Engine download. A slide like this

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,000
means I want you to pause the video, get the Epic Games Launcher, sign in or

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,500
register for Epic, get the Unreal Engine 4.10 or higher downloading,

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,000
and then, carry on watching the video the moment it's downloading.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Or if you're stuck carry on watching, because I'm about to show you how to do it, but please get

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,000
in the habit, right from the beginning of this course, of pausing the video when I ask you to do a challenge

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,500
and trying to solve things yourself! Cool! Welcome

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,000
back! So, let's just make this happen! So, in my case I already have an

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
Epic Games account. What I need to do is

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,000
I just need to sign into it, so I use a tool called LastPass

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,500
for that. There we go! And

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,000
then, I'm going to click on GET UNREAL,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,500
and then, I'm going to ask to get the Unreal Engine.

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,000
So, you click Download. Now, you think that you're going to be getting yourself a big engine

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,500
downloading, but you find that what comes down very very quickly is Epic

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Games Launcher. So, we run that! Install!

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,500
And this is quite small. It's quite a small launcher. It's not

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,000
just for Unreal Engine, it's for other Epic Games products, as well, like

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,500
their past and future games and other projects they have on.

41
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,000
So, we use the Epic Games launcher, we wait until it

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,500
installs but also updates. You might have to wait for

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,000
the Epic Games Launcher to update,

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,500
and then, click on the right one. Then, it's

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
going to ask you to login again. So in my case, this is unreal@

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,500
bentristem.com. Now, I need to

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,000
go get my password from my password management tool, LastPass,

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,500
and paste it into here. Perfect!

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,000
Alright, so this is the Epic Games Launcher, now,

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,500
asking you to sign in. So, you have to sign into their website to get the launcher, and then

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,000
you have to sign into the launcher on your machine. It will probably talk

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,500
about outdated shortcuts. Just click Fix Now. That's for

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,000
all of these games that they have. And where you need to go is UE4

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,500
and Install Engine. So congratulations if you

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,000
worked out how to do that! It's pretty simple. I know, small steps in the beginning.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,500
It's amazing how we've taken you guys from nothing, potentially, or even

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,000
experienced programmers right up to programming in industry strength

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,500
in C++. So, this is downloading and your Visual

59
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Studio may still downloading or may have finished. But regardless there's

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
a few things I want to talk about, while we wait for this to download. So,

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,000
here we go! You've done this download challenge, let's

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,500
move onto the next slide. So, here's an overview of the

63
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,000
install time scale. So, this is on an SSD, with a 100

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,500
megabytes per second Internet connection. There's a lot of text there, but basically,

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,000
Visual Studio is going to take an hour or so. Xcode is going to take 45

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,500
minutes or so. The Epic Games Launcher, you just saw, pretty quick. But then,

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,000
the Unreal Editor is going to take an hour or so. Handy conversion

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,500
for you, just a bit of an extra to the course. If you were to use Wolfram Alpha,

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,000
it will helpfully convert things for you. So, Wolfram Alpha is a fantastic

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,500
tool for doing calculations, and I'll make quite good use of it during the course.

71
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,000
Because if you say things like 13 gigabytes or 10

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,500
megabits per second, it reiterates the assumptions about

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,000
what you've said, which is call and gives you really useful units here. So,

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,500
2 hours 53 minutes. So, that's a bit of a bonus, on the side, for the course!

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,000
You've got your things downloading. Let's talk a little bit more about the eco system. So,

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,500
very bright! Wow! That didn't dazzle you. Unreal Engine

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,000
is on both Windows there and on Mac OS, at the bottom-right,

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,500
so the engine itself will run on both. It will also run on other platforms, for instance Linux,

79
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,000
but you'll have to build your own engine, and we're not going to be covering that. But if you're a

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,500
Linux guy then you can probably handle it, I'm sure. So,

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,000
if you're on Windows then you're going to be using Visual Studio. You could use a different

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,500
IDE or Integrated Development Environment. You could indeed write

83
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,000
all your code in a Text Editor. The thing that something like Visual Studio

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,500
or on a Mac Xcode does for you is, it helps you write

85
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,000
code faster and more accurately. It suggests

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,500
code, it knows somethings bout your code, and it helps you just write it quicker

87
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,000
and more accurately. And even discover things that you can do in your code. You'll see that

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,500
later. And then, those things, the common thing is

89
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,000
the File System right. So, Visual Studio and Xcode write their compile

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,500
code, their processed code, onto your File System for Unreal

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,000
Engine to read. Alright, so I just

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,500
want to talk a little about Windows and Mac OS. So, about 20%

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,000
I estimate are using Mac OS. I've got a Mac, I'm very keen on the Mac, but I am doing

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,500
this whole thing on Windows. Let me explain why. Mac OS

95
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,000
forces you really to use Xcode. There are other tools, but Xcode is the standard. You can't

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,500
refactor on Xcode. That means that you can't refactor. C++

97
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,000
refactoring means renaming, basically,

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,500
and one of the most important things in computer science is renaming. In fact, somebody

99
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,000
said, all problems in computer science come down to renaming and cache coherency,

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,500
which we'll understand later. But you can't refactor properly in Xcode, and that's a

101
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,000
nightmare when were learning, because we really want to be able to rename things quickly.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,500
But you know, there are ways! You can find and replace, you can manually go through.

103
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,000
The other thing about using Mac OS is Oculus SDK isn't supported,

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,500
the software development kit for the Oculus Rift, the VR headset, and

105
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,000
Mac's don't meed the Oculus min spec, at the moment at start,

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,500
unless you're running a naughty Hackintosh! So, you could in the

107
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,000
middle column here, run a Windows Virtual Machine on the Mac and that's fine,

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,500
You can then use Xcode, you can do your refactoring. You

109
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,000
can run the Oculus SDK, but It might be a bit slow. You probably still won't

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,500
meed the Oculus Min Spec. And finally, the best choice really is

111
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,000
to get Windows and then everything is

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,500
green. Whether you meet the Oculus Min Spec. depends on your graphics

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,000
card, mainly. Look at their website for the details, but it's a GTX970

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,500
is the minimum. Don't worry about that now, that's much later in the course. So, choosing

115
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,000
your operating system. I would suggest the best choice is Windows, running on

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,500
a PC or a Mac. The PC is the very top choice, because of the performance.

117
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,000
The second choice would be Mac, using Xcode, and the third choice

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,500
would be something else, Linux or some other Integrated Development Environment, or even a Text

119
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Editor, which we won't be supporting or covering. But if you know what all that means,

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,500
you'll know what I'm talking about and you'll be doing it anyway, because you're stubborn.

121
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,000
"See lecture resources for further reading." So, against the Udemy lectures

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,500
are resources with clickable links. Take a look at those because there's some further reading.

123
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,000
So, that's all I want to cover in this video. In the next video,

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,500
we're going to check on the progress of our IDE download, and hopefully,

125
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,000
it's nearly there and we can get it installed and running and

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,500
write our first C++ code! See you soon, guys!
