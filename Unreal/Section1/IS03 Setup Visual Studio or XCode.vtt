00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi! So, we're going to get Visual Studio or Xcode setup

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
now, depending on whether you're on a PC or a Mac. If you are on a Mac,

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
just skip forward a couple of minutes or skim the first bit, and then, I'll

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
show you about xcode! Welcome to the course and welcome

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
to my Desktop. So, a couple of things to note. Firstly, I have

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500
my Task Bar on the right hand side,

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
and secondly, everything is very large. I'm running at 720 P

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Hi DPI, and that's so that you can follow where

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
I am on the screen. But all of my menus and things are going to look really large compared

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
to yours. So, open up your favorite browser,

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
have a search for Visual Studio 2015,

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.500
and then, follow the links through

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.000
to look something like this. Of course, it'll change over time,

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
and what we're looking for is Visual Studio Community

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Free or Visual Studio 2015 crucially.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.500
If you're on an older version of Visual Studio, we want to go up to version

18
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.000
2015. So, when you go to this page, what's going to happen

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.500
is it's going to download a visual studio installer view. So, let's go and

20
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
run that installer. And this installer

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.500
is both going to download and install Visual Studio for you. So, let's

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.000
see what it's go to say. Now, if you already

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.500
have Visual Studio installed, I still want to do this bit and to go and get this

24
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.000
installer and to update the installer, because we need to make sure you

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500
have the right things installed in Visual Studio.

26
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.000
So, it's going to ask you where you want to install it, and

27
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500
then, it's going to ask for some customization options. Now, we do want to make

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
a minor couple of customizations. This is what I want you to do. Under Programming

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.500
Languages, I want you to select Visual C++. That's going to be

30
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
important, because we're obviously programming in C++. And then, down at the

31
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.500
bottom here, under Common Tools, we've got

32
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Visual Studio Extensibility Tools Update 1. Now,

33
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.500
both of those are in a slide, in your slide deck, which you can

34
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.000
download from the video at the start of the section, in terms of what

35
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500
you need to click. But it's Visual Studio Extensibility Tools Update 1 and

36
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.000
Visual C++.

37
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
So, if you're on a Mac I want you to make sure that you

38
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.000
have Xcode downloaded and installed. We need to go to the Mac

39
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.500
App Store, which is the Apple sign, and then to the App Store.

40
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.000
Then, do a search for Xcode,

41
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.500
and then, when the result comes up, I want yo to see whether

42
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.000
the Xcode is perhaps not installed, in which case, it will say Get like this,

43
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.500
Installing like mine is, or Already Installed, in which case it

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
it says Open. Now, if it is installed, I want you to make sure it is up to date by clicking

45
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.500
Updates, and we want both Xcode and Mac OS to be fully up

46
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.000
to date. Otherwise, just leave it installing. Now, how do you

47
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.500
know how it's doing on the install? Here's a tip for you! If you hit

48
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.000
your Launch Pad Button on your keyboard,and you scroll to

49
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500
the page that the download is on, you'll actually be able to see the progress here: 3 out of 4

50
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.000
Gig, in my case. So, this could take 20 minutes on your

51
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.500
broadband, it could take mnay hours. So, continue watching the course

52
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.000
while that downloads in the background, and I'll tell you when to install it.
