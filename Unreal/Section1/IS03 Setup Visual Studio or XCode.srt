00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to setting up Visual Studio or Xcode. In this video we're going to be getting you the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
tools you need to start programming and diving into

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
this course. It's going to visual studio on the PC and Xcode

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
on the Mac. Now if you're wondering who's talking, it's Sam. You'll see me in a few of these videos

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if you are on a PC then just watch through with me

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
if you are on a Mac then skip just a little bit ahead to where we show you

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
how to install Xcode instead of visual studio. Okay

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So there is a new version of Visual Studio since a lot of the content in this course

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
has been recorded. It's Visual Studio 2017. So go ahead

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and open up your favourite browser of choice and grab Visual Studio

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
2017. Go search for it, you'll end up on a page that looks

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
something like this: visualstudio.com. And you can go ahead and

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
download the Visual Studio Community Edition, is the one

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that's for free. So community 2017. Grab that

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
small download. This is just an installer download so it wont be very big

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
at all. You can go ahead, open it, give it the keys to the kingdom

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and we will get started. So once you've accepted and signed your life away to

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Microsoft with the privacy agreement, then it will download what it needs to

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
give you an option of packages. Now I'm going to show you, it's very simple

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
they've actually improved the simplicity of the installer in the 2017

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
edition. So we will show you just how easy it is. But a couple of things

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
while where at it to show you about the setup that Ben and I have here

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to make things really easy. You'll notice that all the icons, everything is very big this is so

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
it's easy for you guys to see. It's in HiDPI and it's about

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
720p. And also, another thing you'll notice is that

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we have our Windows task bar over at the side here

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and that is again to give you more space to see

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
everything that we are doing and working with. Okay, so we've got the installer

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
popping up now and you will see that there's a couple of what they call

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
"workloads". Now "workloads" basically means what kind of

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
stuff are you going to be doing with Visual Studio. And there's lots of options

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
here. You may want to check more than one if you know you want something else. But

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
if you don't know what you need, then just scroll on down to the section entitled

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
"Mobile and Gaming" and the bottom most option here

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
is "Game Development with C++". We are using that and

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
in fact, if you look in the little description, it also tells you that

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
it's things like Unreal. So that's exactly what we want, so let's check that

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
off and you will notice that over on the right here, it's automatically

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
checked off the components that it's going to install. Such as the Windows 10 SDK

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,033
and the C++ Profiling Tools. But, something I didn't realise the first time

42
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:48,033
 I was doing this video, so you will see that I'm not checking these off, is you also need to check off

43
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,033
the Windows 8.1 SDK in order for Unreal to build some of its plugins

44
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:56,033
and the Unreal Engine installer will be helpful. So you might as well check

45
00:02:56,033 --> 00:03:00,166
those two off as well. And once you've done that, go ahead and hit install.

46
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,932
and leave that running.

47
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,533


48
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,766
So, if you're on a Mac I want you to make sure that you

49
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:11,266
have Xcode downloaded and installed. We need to go to the Mac

50
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:14,766
App Store, which is the Apple sign, and then to the App Store.

51
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:18,266
Then, do a search for Xcode,

52
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:21,766
and then, when the result comes up, I want yo to see whether

53
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:25,266
the Xcode is perhaps not installed, in which case, it will say Get like this,

54
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:28,766
Installing like mine is, or Already Installed, in which case it

55
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,266
it says Open. Now, if it is installed, I want you to make sure it is up to date by clicking

56
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:35,766
Updates, and we want both Xcode and Mac OS to be fully up

57
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:39,266
to date. Otherwise, just leave it installing. Now, how do you

58
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:42,766
know how it's doing on the install? Here's a tip for you! If you hit

59
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:46,266
your Launch Pad Button on your keyboard,and you scroll to

60
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:49,766
the page that the download is on, you'll actually be able to see the progress here: 3 out of 4

61
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:53,266
Gig, in my case. So, this could take 20 minutes on your

62
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,766
broadband, it could take many hours. So, continue watching the course

63
00:03:56,766 --> 00:04:00,266
while that downloads in the background, and I'll tell you when to install it.
