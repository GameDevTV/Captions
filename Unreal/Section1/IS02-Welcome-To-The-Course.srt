00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Hey and welcome to the course! Well done getting started! If it's been

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
a little while since you watched the promo video above, then take a quick look,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
because it gives you a great overview of the course. In just a few minutes we'll start

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
downloading and installing Unreal. Before we do that, I just want to talk about the structure

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
of the course for you. Firstly, attached to this video and

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
the talking head video, at the start of every section, are the section

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
notes. Now, that is a .pdf that you can take and

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,000
copy off, print out if you must, but consider the tress, maybe don't print.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Maybe just take electronic notes, on those slides,

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,000
and it's a copy of all the slides that I use in the course and gives you plenty of

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
opportunity to take your own notes and make your own annotations, etc.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,000
So, that's that there attached! Please download those and start using those.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
I want to talk about the people who get the most from this course, and of course,

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
the people who get the most from the course are the people who put the most into the course.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,500
So, make sure you're one of those people! Participate heavily

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,000
in the discussions. Try and answer other students' questions.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,500
Ask good questions yourself. Share your progress and your fears and your

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,000
concerns and your successes and your failures, and just

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,500
put a little bit extra in. Do what I do in the videos, but also

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,000
do some other stuff. Just explore and enjoy the course and you'll

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,500
get absolutely tons out of it. And support, what

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,000
support to expect? Well, I'll be in the community support forums,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,500
most weekdays. Not very often on the weekend, but Monday to

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,000
Friday I'll be there most days, I'll pop in. And the most important thing,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,500
however, is to support each other. And the way to do that firstly is to

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,000
ask very good questions, and just make sure that if you are on the other side

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,500
of the fence that you would have a chance of answering the question. Make it as short

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,000
as possible, your question, but as long as necessary. And talking about being on the other side

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
of the fence, help answer other peoples' questions. Even if you don't know the answer,

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,000
start the conversation! You know, imagine you're there stuck taking your course,

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,500
and you ask a question. It's great if another student comes back to you

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,000
really quickly. So, the best way to encourage that is for you to be one of those people,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,500
that responds to questions of the students really fast! I will, of course,

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,000
come in very regularly and help keep the conversation on track.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Please respond to each other's questions. Try and help each other out.

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,000
The only other thing to say is, what happens if you're more experienced?

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,500
Well, if you're a more experienced user, then have a look through the

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,000
sections of the course, and find the first section that you think would

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,500
be a real challenge for you. And then, just try and do that one as quickly

41
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,000
as you can, and then pick the course up from there. Everybody else should just do

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,500
everything, apart from the occasional optional video like installing for a Mac.

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,000
If you don't have one, you skip that, but otherwise, all the videos are there for a purpose.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,500
The learning journey is carefully crafted, and we look forward to taking you from

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
0... This is very corny! From 0 to hero

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,500
but that's what we're aiming to do! OK, in the next video we're going to get

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,000
on and get Unreal downloading and installing. See you soon!
