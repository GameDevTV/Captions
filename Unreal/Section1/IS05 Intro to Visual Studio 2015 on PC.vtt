00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
So, in this video were are going to, by the end of it,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
have written some very simple code, that is actually going to

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
be able to say something to the screen proving

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
that our development environment works out and that

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
we are able to compile C++ code. So, let's get on with it!

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500
So, we left a couple of things downloading,

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
before all the chit chat, and one of those was Visual Studio. So,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.500
we started Visual Studio first, and I'm hoping that it's downloaded for you now.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
It depends entirely how fast your broadband is, of course.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
So, here we are! I'm going to launch Visual Studio

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
for the fist time! Now, if you're on a Mac and you're saying, what's

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.500
Visual Studio? What's he talking about? Well, then I'm going to cover Xcode at the end of this

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.000
video, again for you. So, here we go! This is the

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
website. We don't really need to see the website, so

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000
there we are! Visual Studio!

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.500
It's just doing some stuff, let it do some stuff OK. Let it get

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.000
going! Now, the flag I talked about, the Update Flag is up here. There

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.500
are five notifications. It's definitely worth doing any updates

19
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
straight away. So, these types

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.500
of updates, unless you recognize or are

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.000
told you need to do it, you can just clear those, but if there are any major

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.500
updates to the system, then you need to do that, any Visual Studio updates themselves.

23
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.000
So, what is Visual Studio? It's an Integrated

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500
Development Environment, it helps you write code. And this is going to be

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.000
an industry standard tool we're using here. So, it's

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500
pretty cool! It's a pretty heavy weight tool, but it's very powerful. It's very

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
customizable. And all we want to do here is kind of make sure that it works and

28
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.500
that we can customize and we can compile.

29
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
Compiling means turning your code into something that the computer can run. If you

30
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.500
see things like this, little errors, then the is talking about

31
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.000
you being logged into your Microsoft

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.500
Account. You don't have to do it at first, but sooner or later it's going to ask you to

33
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.000
log into your account. So, I'm going to go ahead and

34
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500
do that now. And if you do see it asking you, just do sign in with

35
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.000
the Microsoft Account, when you're first asked to do it. And once you're

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
signed in, you'll be able to see your name up here and the nags will go away.

37
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.000
So, let's go ahead and make our own new project!

38
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.500
Now, once we're using Unreal, then Unreal will actually create our

39
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.000
projects and our solutions for us, but for now, let's get a basic familiarity

40
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.500
with Visual Studio. Say New Project, and then, I want you to go down

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.000
to Visual C++, here on your list.

42
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.500
Visual C++ and then Win32 Console

43
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
Application. Now, where are you going to save this? Well, it's a very

44
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.500
trivial application, so it doesn't really matter. I'm

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.000
going to call it HelloWorld. What I'm saying

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.500
is that we don't really need to come back to this later. This is going to be very very simple, we're

47
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.000
just testing that things work. So,

48
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500
just click Next and Finish. Don't worry about what any of that

49
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.000
stuff means, it could take a lifetime to learn what all this means. We just need to make

50
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.500
sure that our Visual Studio is going to compile C++ code, before we

51
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.000
get Unreal all setup and installed. So, here we go, this is C++!

52
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.500
So, what do we have here? At the top, we have green

53
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.000
stuff that starts with a double forward slash. These are comments. They're completely

54
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.500
ignored by the computer. They're there to help you, and we'll be talking

55
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000
in the course a lot about how to use comments, but for now, we don't need anything there.

56
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.500
#include, they allow the code to access other

57
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.000
code, in simple terms, and we are going to need one of those to make sure that

58
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.500
we're able to write to the Console. And what I want you

59
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000
to do is, I want you to write #include and

60
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.500
then, left chevron. Now, when you do that, it's going to load up a list of all the

61
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.000
things that are available in the standard directories that Visual Studio is looking

62
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.500
for. And what I'm looking for is something called

63
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.000
&lt;iostream&gt;, i o s t r e a m. And you see how

64
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.500
if you start typing it and then hit the Return key, it'll actually fill it in

65
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.000
for you. That reduces error and increases your coding speed. So,

66
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.500
#include &lt;iostream&gt;. That's awesome! Then, what I want you to

67
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.000
do is, come down to line 9 and make sure you're indented one tab.

68
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.500
If you do what I just did, which is select at the end of line 8 and hit Return, you

69
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000
will be selected in one tab, but please use a tab and not four spaces.

70
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.500
So, now that we have access to &lt;iostream&gt;, within

71
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.000
there there's something called std, which is a name space, basically a

72
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.500
grouping of bits of code. Colon colon let's us

73
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.000
go inside that, and then, we have something called

74
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.500
cout. So, I want you to go std::cout space,

75
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.000
left chevron left chevron, and we'll explain a little later in the course what

76
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.500
that means. For now, we're just trying to test that the system works,

77
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.000
and then, it's going to be "HelloWorld. I'm going to

78
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.500
put an exclamation and then a backslash n". Now look, when you write

79
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.000
code you have to be very precise. It's very important that

80
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.500
it looks exactly like this, and then, on the end we've got a semicolon. On the end of all

81
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.000
lines there's a semicolon. In fact, in C++, just like in C#, that's

82
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.500
the only way the Compiler knows that your statement

83
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.000
has finished. OK! So, that's what I want you to write!

84
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.500
And when you've written that, go to Debug and start with

85
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.000
Debugging or Control, F, 5, and see what happens!

86
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.500
Would you like to build it? Yes! And look

87
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.000
what pops up! A Windows Console Application

88
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.500
that says, "Hello World! Press any key to continue..." And when we do, it just

89
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.000
exits. So congratulations! If you've got this far, you have your

90
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.500
computer with an industry strength Integrated

91
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.000
Development Environment up and running. You're able to compile code, which means turn

92
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.500
your text into something the computer can run ultimately, 1's

93
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.000
and 0's. And that is all working fantastically!

94
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.500
So, good job with that! You'll understand code a lot lot better

95
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.000
as we go through the course, but you are setup and ready. We're going look at the Unreal

96
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.500
Editor next. And if you're on a PC, as you probably are watching this far end

97
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.000
of this video, just skip the next one, it's about Xcode. See you soon!
