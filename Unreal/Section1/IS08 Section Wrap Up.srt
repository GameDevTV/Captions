1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
So well done getting yourself setup with Unreal! You're all ready to

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
go right now. I know it all looks bewildering and a bit crazy but

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
that's absolutely fine! The point is, the system is installed.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
So, what I would like you to do now is get used to using the discussions. Just go to the

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
discussion agasint this very lecture, and just introduce yourself.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Just say hi! I'm Joe Bloggs! I'm from this part of the world,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
here's my experience, and here's what I'd like to achieve in the course.! Just get

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
the discussion going. And also make the effort to have a look for other people

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
introducing themselves, and look for a common point of interest.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Maybe you live in the same place? Maybe you've got the same dreams or goals?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Just look for something in common and start conversations with people. You can

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,000
make real friends here on the course. If I may make a suggestion?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Start the next section right now! Don't finish a section

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,000
and walk away. It may just be my personality type, but I

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
personally love to leave it hanging, so that I'm really compelled to go

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
back. So, dive straigt into the next section, get the first couple of videos done,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,500
and then, kind of finish halfway through a video. And then, you'll be compelled

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,000
to come back and get it finished. And use that strategy every time! I find it

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,500
really useful for making sure I keep momentum, because getting the most out of this

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,000
course is all about just showing up. 99% of it is just

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,500
turning up and doing the work. So, do it! It's going to be great fun!

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm really looking forward to working with you. That's it really!

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,500
All I'm going to do now is talk to experienced C#

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,000
developers, for a second, and just give you a bit of a rundown. So, it that's not you.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,500
If you're not an experienced C# developer, then

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,000
carry onto the next section, and I'll see you soon!

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,500
If you've got some existing C# knowledge I just want to say firstly,

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,000
great news! A lot of what you already know will transfer over to C++.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Some of it's pretty much identical! Things like if statements

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,000
and some of the loops. A lot of the syntax is very very similar.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
One major change you're going to have to get used to is

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,000
.H files, Header Files. When you specify the signature

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,500
of your methods, you're going to have to put those over in a

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,000
separate file. And it's just a legacy of how

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,500
C++ works, but once you're used to it, you'll be doing

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,000
it in a hurry but that's different. You can do a lot of cool bit wise

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,500
operations. In fact, in the very next section, we're going to almost artificially

38
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,000
start introducing bit wise operations, just in the spirit of C++,

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,500
which gives you a lot more low level control, if you need it.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,000
But on that topic, don't worry too much about memory management. I know people think, oh

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,500
I've got to worry about memory. Well, if you're thinking about that too much early on

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,000
then you're probably doing something wrong, because Unreal is going to help us a lot with that.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,500
What else to say? Oh, and get used to a couple of syntactic

44
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,000
differences. So, where you're used to a dot operator,

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,500
you're going to start seeing a dash chevron and a colon colon,

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
and all of that is summarized in the section notes for you, by the way.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,266
So let's get stuck in!
