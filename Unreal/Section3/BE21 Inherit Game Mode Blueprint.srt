
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, welcome

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to Inherit Game Mode Blueprint! In this video, we're going to inherit a Game

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mode Blueprint, from a Game Mode. So, I'm going to

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
explain, right now, that hard coding means assets are actually written into

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the code. It would mean that we refer to something by its name and file path, in the

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
code, and the problem with that is that it's pretty hard to

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
track changes, so the DefaultPawn_BP is an asset. We want to be able to rename that if

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
necessary, without worrying about updating all our code, as I've said there.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, it's convenient to use Blueprint for this purpose, and what we're going to be doing

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is extending the C++ Game Mode that our project

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
came with. By the way, why did it come with C++ Game Mode? Because, when we set

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the game up, we chose C++ game in the very beginning right,, and that gives us

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
C++ Game Mode, which we always want, because you can always just extend nothing with Blueprint,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
at least you've got the C++ there if you want it. Once you've started with Blueprint, you can't

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
quite as easily add C++ before it, you have to inherit

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
from C++ to Blueprint, and we will then ultimately be

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
selecting on your DefaultPawn. So, by the end of it, what'll happen if we play if I

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
play and... Oops, here we go! If I play and then

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
eject myself and then look at the pawn, a couple of things about it. Firstly, on

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
details, we have a Grabber component there coming by default, which is cool. And also,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,566
we're proving that our code is getting called, because we have "Grabber reporting for duty!" So, let's see how all that works!

22
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:29,566
So, welcome back! The first thing I'm going to do is tidy up this pawn that I instantiated,

23
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:33,566
that's sitting here. It doesn't need to be sitting on my floor, so I'm going to delete that and just check

24
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:37,566
where we are. We're in a situation where the DefaultPawn is still

25
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:41,566
spawning, but at least, in our Content Browser, we have access to a Blueprint

26
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:45,566
default pawn and what we need to be able to do is actually set it under Maps & Modes.

27
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:49,566
And I'm repeating myself here, but this is important stuff! So,

28
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:53,566
first thing we're going to need is a blueprinted Building Escape Game Mode. So, our Building Escape

29
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:57,566
Game Mode, at the moment, is a C++ class right, it's here! And yes,

30
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:01,566
we can add behavior to that, and if it's going to be more natural to add it in code, we'll do that,

31
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:04,933
but what we want to do is inherit a blueprint from there.

32
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:09,566
So, it's going to be a blueprint, based on the BuildingEscapeGame

33
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:13,566
.cpp, GameMode.cpp. Alright, in

34
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,566
very much the same way, that if we go into our content we look at our DefaultPawn,

35
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:21,566
if you see me hover over that you see how it says Parent

36
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:25,566
Class Default Pawn. So, it's actually got a parent class already,

37
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:29,566
it's just that it's not inside our code. It's actually in...

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,566
Well, let's go into Visual Studio and see where it's getting that from. It's not solution

39
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:37,566
files that we have written. It is going to be right inside the

40
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:41,566
engine, OK, and you're going to have to dig right in to see where

41
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,566
"defaultpawn" is. Let's do a little search in

42
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:49,566
here. DefaultPawn

43
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:53,566
.cpp, there's an example of it. So, it's in the engine files, we don't want to mess with

44
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:57,566
those, right. So, that's why we're inheriting from the DefaultPawn

45
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:01,566
as a blueprint. We could also inherit from the DefaultPawn

46
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:05,566
as a C++ file and extend its behavior, but we're using Blueprint. So, we're going to do

47
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:09,566
exactly the same thing for the Game Mode, so I want

48
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:13,566
you to do that. Actually, I think you can work it out with what we've learned so far! So, make a Game Mode Blueprint,

49
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:17,566
find the C++ Game Mode in the Content Browser, create a Blueprint class

50
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:21,566
derived, inheriting from it. Set this as the Default GameMode in

51
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:25,566
Settings, Project Settings, Maps & Modes, and make sure

52
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:29,566
the game still runs the same what it did before. So, go ahead, pause the video,

53
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:33,566
and see if you can make the game run off your Game Mode Blueprint now!

54
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:37,566
OK, welcome back! So, this is how

55
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:41,566
I think we do it. We go find our C++ Game Mode, which is here, right-click.

56
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:45,566
Create Blueprint class based on BuildingEscapeGameMode. Cool!

57
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:49,566
Now, what are we going to call it? Well, I'm going to give you a convention, which we used before,

58
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:53,566
which is just a suffix with BP not cp, to say it's

59
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,566
a blueprint. Create Blueprint Class! Wicked! There it is, there's the Blueprint Inspector

60
00:03:57,566 --> 00:04:01,566
and one of the cool things in here, and you can do it right away actually, is we can

61
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:05,566
set... Now, the Default Pawn Class, search for p a w n, to the

62
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:09,566
Blueprinted one that we made. Cool hey, Compile!

63
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:13,566
Remember, I said when you change a blueprint you click compile?

64
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:17,566
Nearly there, Settings, Project Settings,

65
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:21,566
Maps & Modes, Default GameMode,

66
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:25,566
pick our blueprint, close. See what happens when we play!

67
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:29,566
Now, how do we know if that's worked? Well,

68
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:33,566
we can play and eject ourselves and have a look at the blueprint.

69
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:37,566
Is this the one we're looking for? Click on it, look at Details.

70
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:41,566
Grabber, it's got a Grabber on it! Woo hoo! So,

71
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:45,566
we have changed the Game Mode to our own one. We have changed the Default Pawn

72
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:49,566
and now we've got a Grabber. Why don't we go ahead and just make that Grabber like

73
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:53,566
report for duty right. So, we Play, we Eject, we take a look at our own

74
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:57,566
body, we find the Grabber, we Open Grabber.h.

75
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:01,566
And then, I'm going to go and

76
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:05,566
find an existing UE log entry, because I don't want to have to worry about remembering

77
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:09,566
the syntax, although occasionally I'll challenge myself to remember the syntax but there it is!

78
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:13,566
OK, going to go to Grabber.h! Go find Grabber.cpp

79
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:17,566
actually, because I need the implementation. And what I'm going

80
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:21,566
to do in here is, just on BeginPlay(), I'm going to do this, I'm going to say

81
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:25,566
without any of these funny format parameters, I'm simply going to say

82
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:29,566
("Grabber reporting for

83
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:33,566
duty!"); OK, and then

84
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:37,566
match the brackets. Let's immediately build this because I get quite nervous about macros,

85
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:41,566
because if we do get them wrong then it's nearly impossible to fix.

86
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:45,566
Because the error message that you get from macros

87
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:49,566
stink or they're inadequate

88
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:53,566
to easily fix the problem. So, here we go, it's built,

89
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:57,566
which is fantastic! If we now go over, play the game again,

90
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,566
and look, we can see down, oops, here in

91
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:05,566
Output Log: "Grabber reporting for duty!". I think we've achieved what we want to in this

92
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:09,566
video, we have made a Grabber actually appear and report.

93
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:13,566
So, what we can do, moving forward now, is to start to actually write the functionality

94
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:17,566
into this Grabber file. We'll have a Grabber.h, which I'm going to

95
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:21,566
arrange on the left-hand side, which basically is just

96
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:25,566
boiler plate code, at the moment. We have a constructor,

97
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:29,566
it has prefixed it with U because that's Unreal's coding convention. We have a Begin

98
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:33,566
Play() and a TickComponent, and then, in Grabber.cpp it's

99
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:37,566
saying yes that it's ticking here. And, by the way, as a simple

100
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:41,566
tip, if you ever have any components that don't need to tick, i.e. that don't need to do everything every

101
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,566
tick, then we would disable that for performance, but we're going to let this guy tick,

102
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:49,566
which means that this TickComponent() method will be called by the engine every single frame.

103
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:53,566
OK, we've logged out that we're beginning play, and what we're going to do down here

104
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:57,566
is to start thinking about the very structure of how our grabber is going to work. So, in the

105
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:01,566
next video, we'll pseudocode that up and then start

106
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:05,566
actually making it happen! So, see you there!
