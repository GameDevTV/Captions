1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, let's

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
find out about using Blueprint Timeline. In this video,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the Timeline node is a Blueprint

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
feature that has a curve editor in it. This is a perfect way of defining how a door

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is going to be moving graphically, in a graphic interface. I'll  be showing you

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
how to use these curves in Blueprint, and then,we'll be setting a rotation of the

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
door from a Timeline. What does all this mean? It means that by the end of the video,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we will have a door that opens like that, nice

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.500
and smoothly. Awesome, let's go get it done!

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.500
So, let the fun begin! Let's start making our doors swing,

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.500
according to a curve, so over into the door blueprint!

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.500
So, what we have here is the Event Graph Tab.

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.500
You're starting, hopefully, to get a feel for what this does. We have this unopened request coming from

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.500
code. The white line is an execution flow and it's triggering a

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.500
setting of an Actor Rotation. And for the

16
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.500
moment, we've just parameterized that right in here and said,

17
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.500
when the request comes through immediately set the rotation to 80 degrees,

18
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500
which has the rather unfortunate effect of still

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.500
just having the door open, boom like that, instantaneously! So, that's

20
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.500
the first thing we want to improve. We want it to open over

21
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.500
time. So, how do we do that? Well, if you right-click

22
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.500
on your blueprint, you've got all sorts of categories in here, and at the very

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.500
bottom you've got Add Timeline, or you could just search for timeline.

24
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.500
You get several things then, but you still want Add Timeline. So let's do that, let's add a Timeline!

25
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.500
OK, what is this Timeline thing? Let's take a little look at it.

26
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.500
I'm just going to reduce the number of tabs that I have hanging around, so that we can

27
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.500
focus on what we're doing here. In fact, I don't even need

28
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.500
the Components right now. OK, that's better isn't it, we can see

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.500
what's going on! So, what this does is, if you double-click it,

30
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500
you'll see that you actually have a set of curves, or we can

31
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500
create a set of curves to do with the Timeline. So, let's do

32
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.500
this! Get your Timeline down, double-click it, which will open up the Curve

33
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Editor, and let's add a Float Track. There are various other types of vectors, events, and

34
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.500
things, but let's just worry about float for now. We're just going to use a floating point value between

35
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.500
0 and 90 degrees to control the opening of the door. So, you add a Float

36
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.500
Track. We're going to call this Float Track Open

37
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.500
Angle. Now, let me just give you the big picture for a minute. You don't need to follow me, for a second. If I add

38
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.500
another Float Track, it could be something else

39
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.500
OK, and then, what this Curve Editor is doing, if you

40
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.500
click in the right place and scroll up and down, is you can collapse down these different tracks,

41
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Open Angle and something else. Let's just go back to the Event Graphs. Look what happens!

42
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.500
They get exposed as floats, on the right-hand side of this Timeline

43
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500
block. OK, you can rename the Timeline block, if you like, by right-

44
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.500
clicking it, rename, and call it Door Swing,

45
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.500
because this is what it's going to do. And what's going to happen is, when something comes in on the left-hand side,

46
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.500
like for instance the OpenDoorRequest, it's going to start playing

47
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.500
the Door Swing Timeline, and then,

48
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.500
these values, the open door and something else, are going to change over time

49
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.500
according to the curves. OK, so we don't need something else. I'm going to delete

50
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.500
that by right-clicking and Delete. We only need an open

51
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.500
angle curve. So, you see this is updated, we just have an Open Angle float

52
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.500
output. So, right-click, add key to float. Now, by the way, you can

53
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.500
either completely follow me along with this, right now... I do want to tell you that your challenge

54
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.500
is going to be to setup your own curves, in a moment, for your door

55
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.500
to your eye. So, you can either do it now as we go, or you can

56
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500
watch me do it and then I'll give you an opportunity to pause and do it yourself in a minute. So, we

57
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.500
add a key, this is like a key frame. Now, you can adjust it by dragging

58
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.500
it around, and you'll notice that the time and value are changing. So, around

59
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.500
here is around 0 time, the start. We have an angle

60
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.500
value of whatever, of half a degree. So, I'm

61
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500
actually going to click it and type in a Time 0.0. I want an angle of

62
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500
0. How do I know it's 0? Well, let's go and inspect the door for a moment.

63
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.500
There's the door, have a little look at it, Details. You see that the

64
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.500
Rotation is 000. What do we want the Rotation to end up? Well,

65
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.500
we want it to end up -90, remember?

66
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.500
So, back to your Curve Editor, add another keyframe,

67
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.500
click it. Then, Time say ooh I don't know, I think

68
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.500
I'll get my door to open every 2 seconds to -90 degrees. Now, your

69
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.500
scale is all messed up, you can't see anything. You can scroll around with the Right Mouse,

70
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.500
zoom in and out with the Mouse Wheel, but this isn't really the way to do it. This button here,

71
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.500
towards the top-left of the graph, zooms to Horizontal Fit. The other one is

72
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.500
zooms to vertical fit, so that's what we want to do. Now, we can see our curve.

73
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.500
It's a straight line, opening over a period of 2 seconds. Well, we could have

74
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.500
done that in code easily enough, so why have you made all of this? Why have you gone

75
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.500
to all this trouble? Well, right-click on one of the nodes and select it

76
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.500
to Auto Interpolation. There are various different types. Auto, as it says,

77
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.500
creates automatic tangents. You see what's happened there? I can now change

78
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.500
the curve, using these tangent handles, and that is the

79
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.500
power of actually doing it here in the Node Editor. Once I've set one

80
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.500
node to Auto, I can change the curve appearance. You wouldn't want it to swing past,

81
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.500
necessarily past 90 degrees. You might, a little bit, but I just want mine to be a

82
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.500
smooth curve. This is much much harder to do in code, and we can add other

83
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.500
keyframes and move things around and we can make them like break

84
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.500
nodes, which means you get a sudden change, you break that tangent. Or you

85
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.500
can make them User nodes or Auto nodes,

86
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500
which are nice and even. Lots of different options to play with, but I'm just going to have

87
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.500
two keyframes and I'm just going to go smoothly like that OK.

88
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.500
The other thing is the length. You need to look at the length of the animation.

89
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.500
If I have 2 seconds here and I have 5 seconds for the length, let's

90
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.500
see what actually happens before we fix the problem that I know is going to happen.

91
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.500
So, we've just got a 2 second animation.

92
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.500
Don't worry about the length, you'll see the consequence of that in a minute. Let's take the Open Angle as a

93
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.500
float. Now we can't, it's green right? It's a float, and what this rotation wants is a rotator,

94
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.500
if you hover over it. We can't just put a float into a rotator. It says,

95
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.500
"Float is not compatible with rotator." So, what we do is, you drag the float into the middle of

96
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.500
nowhere, type the word rotator, and you can see Make Rotator

97
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.500
ah! Now, what do you want to plug float into? Is it Roll,

98
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.500
Pitch, or Yaw? Well, let's look at the door, and remind ourselves what's going on.

99
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.500
Minimize this, look at the door. This is Pitch, remember?

100
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.500
This would be Roll of the door, and this one here is

101
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.500
Yaw, so the Z is Yaw we're looking for.

102
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.500
If you want to move a line that you've made, you either right-click and say break,

103
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.500
or you can hold down Control and you'll move from

104
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.500
this selector to a hand and then you can drag to a new position. So, we want

105
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.500
Open Angle to go into the Yaw node, and out of that comes a Rotator. You see

106
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.500
the color there, it's a Rotator, into the new Rotation.

107
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.500
So, this is just a cast or a change of

108
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.500
type. OK, pretty cool right! So, on

109
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.500
up, if we just run this now, let's try it! I'm going to put this on the right-hand

110
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.500
side and you can put your game on the left-hand side, and you don't even need to compile your blueprint,

111
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.500
by the way. If you play the game, the blueprint will compile. Now watch

112
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.500
what happens when I get on the pressure pad. You can see the execution line, you see what's happening here.

113
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.500
The red on the right-hand side there is saying that I've got a continuous firing

114
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.500
of this open request into the play node. Alright,

115
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.500
now the door hasn't moved, because we need to wire the update of the door

116
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.500
swing into the Set Actor

117
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.500
Rotation, because what's happening is the Set Actor

118
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.500
Rotation, each of these nodes... Well, straight value changes can

119
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.500
happen in an instant but the rest of these nodes have to happen on an update,

120
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.500
and there is no tick come execution pin or tick coming into Set Actor

121
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.500
Rotation. So, on the update of the Door Swing, like this, we do that.

122
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.500
Alright, we could do it from an update tick node, but why bother when we have an

123
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.500
update coming out of the Door Swing. So, let's see what difference that's made. It'll make sense

124
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.500
in context, I'm hoping. Let's play now, Alt P is an

125
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.500
easy way of doing that. Now, you see the execution goes through and the

126
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.500
door swings nicely. Now, we have a problem with the closing of the door, but we'll

127
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.500
deal with that in a moment. You see what's happening there. So it's now,

128
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.500
when I step back on the plate, what's happening is the animation is finished. Let's look a bit more

129
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.500
closely at this bit here. Door Swing paused. OK, let's start

130
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.500
again and just analyze this carefully. Door Swing, 1 second,

131
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.500
2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, 5 seconds. You see

132
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.500
that the animation is 5 seconds long, and yet we've only got 2 seconds worth of

133
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.500
the door swinging. Let's watch that again! The door is fully open after 2

134
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.500
seconds, per our curves, but the animation is lasting for a full 5

135
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.500
seconds OK. So, that is what I meant, when we go into the

136
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.500
Curve Editor, about the length. We don't want to have to manually change this length every time

137
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.500
to match this last keyframe, so you click

138
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.500
Use Last Keyframe. Now, this value isn't changing, that's a bit annoying.

139
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.500
It may change, if we're really lucky, but it doesn't seem to want to. let me

140
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.500
just come out and go in and see if it changes. I don't think it will. No, it

141
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.500
doesn't change but it has changed. Let's watch! Oops, sorry back into the

142
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.500
Node Editor, get on the right-hand side, get the Event Graph up,

143
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.500
and we're going to watch this time here, paused 0. And let's just play

144
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.500
again and see what happens! And the percentage, you see the total percentage

145
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.500
100%, at two seconds now. So, this means that your curve

146
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.500
and your animation length are the same. Because you could have multiple curves, you could be doing lots of

147
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.500
things to lots of different axes of moment. We just want the whole animation

148
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.500
to end, when the time gets to the last keyframe. Ignore this 5,

149
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.500
it's being overridden by Use Last Keyframe. It's not a brilliant interface.

150
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.500
So, we're there! In the next video, what we're going to do is add another node, as you can see

151
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.500
on this slide, called OnCloseRequest, and we're going to make that run the whole Timeline

152
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.500
backwards. Don't do that now, I'm just tell you that, that's what we're going to end up doing. What I

153
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.500
do want you to do now, is if you haven't already caught of with me, I want you to pause the video,

154
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.500
build your own Blueprint, set your own curves

155
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.500
how you want them, and just do everything

156
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.500
on this diagram, except the OnCloseRequest OK, because we'll be covering that in the next

157
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.500
video. And I'll see you in the next video!

158
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:27.900
