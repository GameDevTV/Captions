00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000


2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000


3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000


4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000


5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000


6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000


7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000


8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000


9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000


10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000


11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000


12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000


13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000


14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000


15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000


16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.800


17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.800
So, let's start actually building a level now we know we can

18
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.800
do basic control over this. But this looks a bit rubbish, just having a door standing

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.800
here, so let's start fleshing out a level. So, we're going to start by just getting

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.800
the structure of the level, and then, in a future video, we're going to talk about materials, beautiful

21
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.800
materials down on these floor panels. Now, there are two basic ways of laying out a level.

22
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.800
One is with something called Static Meshes, which are pretty much what they sound like. These

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.800
doors and chairs are all Static Meshes. They are meshes in that they are just a series

24
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.800
of what we call vertices. You can see that, by the way, by click on say the

25
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.600
door, right-clicking, and you can say Edit SM_Door. And if you bring it up,

26
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.800
this new Editor window that will come up, you will have a whole new window come up over the top.

27
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.800
If you click Wireframe, you can see all of the triangles that comprise

28
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.800
this actual model, and you can even look at all the vertices, which are the points where

29
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.800
all the triangles meet. Alright, so that's what we mean by a

30
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.800
mesh, and static just means it's non-skeletal. There is another way of

31
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.800
building levels, by the way. In the Modes Panel, so you go Window and Modes, there's something called

32
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.800
BSP, Binary Space Partitioning, which is a technical name for how

33
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.800
the geometry is actually stored, so the computer can

34
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.800
work out what is in the way of what, etc. Now, the thing about BSP is,

35
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.800
you can actually flesh out levels with BSP. We're not going to yet, in this

36
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.800
instance. It has some advantages, which is for example in

37
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.800
Unreal here we can actually do vertex or face editing. I can grab

38
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800
a face of something in BSP and move it, and I can even slew it along like this.

39
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.800
So, it can be more flexible for very simple geometry. The disadvantage is

40
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.800
that it's not as performant, it does not run as fast as using

41
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.800
custom Static Meshes made by an artist. BSP is an a bit of an acronym,

42
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.800
it's an old way of doing things. Alright, so we will look at BSP

43
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.800
probably later in the course, but for now, I'm going to get rid of this Box Brush thing

44
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.800
here. And if you see it's of type Brush, that's the indication that this is a piece of BSP.

45
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.800
We're not going to do it that way! What we're going to do is go to the Content Browser,

46
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.800
and there's two tabs of the Starter Content or folders

47
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.800
in the Starter Content I want you to look at. One is the Architecture one, which will have floor panels,

48
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.800
like this 400 by 400 floor panel here. If we poured another one of those into the

49
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.800
game, you would see it's a little bit smaller than the standard floor panel.

50
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.800
In fact, it's about half the size. And you've got other sized floor panels, but

51
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.800
you've also got wall panels. Alright, So to get rid of that, I've just hit the Delete

52
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.800
Key on the keyboard. So, what I'm going to do is just show you briefly how to start

53
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.800
laying out wall panels, putting a door in, etc. and then, I'm going to challenge

54
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.800
you to build yourself at least one room of geometry. You're welcome to go ahead and build two

55
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.800
or three if you wish. So, here's the idea, we grab ourselves a wall panel.

56
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800
So, for instance, 400 is the height, 300 is the width. That would be

57
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.800
perhaps a good start! If you want to rotate it, of course, it's the E Key.

58
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.800
E to Rotate Mode and then rotate like that, by grabbing the blue bit.

59
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.800
Then, W... So, I've got my fingers on Q, W, E, as in

60
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.800
QWERTY, and I can then choose the different tools, so E let's me

61
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.800
translate. Now, how do we get this exactly at the edge of the map? Well, if it's not already on the

62
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.800
floor, the End Key will bring it down to the floor,

63
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.800
and then, you can move left and right. Now, here's a good tip for you! As you move

64
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.800
this thing, if you hold down the Shift Key, watch what happens. The camera

65
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.800
goes with it so if we're trying to align this edge, we can come around here where we could

66
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.800
make the judgement, hold down the Shift Key, select the red arrow through the geometry,

67
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.800
and then align like this. Now, we want to get this precise,

68
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.800
so pick a grid snapping of 5 or 10 centimeters. You may find

69
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.800
that 10 doesn't align, see I'm off grid here at 10.

70
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.800
So, if I go back down to 5 and move it one place, that's exactly right!

71
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.800
If I went back to 10, you'd notice that I'm back on

72
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.800
the 10 grid, if that makes sense. So, have a play with your grid spacing

73
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.800
here, and either holding down Shift or not holding down Shift, depending

74
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.800
on whether you want the camera to move with you. Alright, so that would be putting a wall panel

75
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.800
in. Then, how do we get the door in? Well, we've actually got a door and a door frame here.

76
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.800
We could select the two of them by selecting one, holding Shift, and selecting the other,

77
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.800
and now we can just move the door into the frame. I'm going to use the

78
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.800
End Key above the floor, to put it on the floor,

79
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.800
and then I'm just going to put this frame snuggly in here. Now, there's another view I want to

80
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.800
show you, before I slide this frame in, which is if we click at the very top-right

81
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.800
of your 3D Viewport. It says "Maximizes or restores this viewport". Look what happens!

82
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.800
I'm going to get rid of the Output Log. We go to a four-way view and each of these can

83
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.800
dragged around with the Right Mouse Button and zoom in and out, and what I'm

84
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.800
doing here is, I'm looking at the door from above. So look how easy it is to see that, that door is definitely in the

85
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.800
right place, in both the side view and the top view.

86
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.800
See that, the front view and the top view specifically. Cool! So, our

87
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.800
door is now in there! I'm going to re-maximize at the top-right of the Perspective View,

88
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.800
and just click Play and prove that obviously that code continues running.

89
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.800
Fine, so now it's a relatively simple question of

90
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.800
selecting these objects and putting them where we want. So, if I want my door on the end here,

91
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.800
I do that. And then if I want another wall panel, I'm going

92
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.800
to go for a what? Well, it was a 400 by 300 before, let's try the same thing

93
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.800
again. OK, and then it's a question of moving it

94
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.800
into place. Now, you can get yourself above.

95
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.800
There's lots of little ways we can make this easier for ourselves, lots of tools and extra

96
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.800
keyboard shortcuts and all sorts of things, but for now, I just want to get you in

97
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.800
with a basic idea. There we go! Now, we've got a really ugly

98
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.800
seam here, between the two of these guys and around the

99
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.800
door. But you'll probably find that when you go to Build and Build Lighting Only,

100
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.800
that when it does a quick lighting build that those problems will disappear.

101
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.800
And there you go! So, that's just a

102
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.800
lighting preview issue. Alright, so I've got a couple of wall panels

103
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.800
in there. What would I do if I wanted thinner wall panels? Well, you can actually

104
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.800
duplicate, say, this wall panel.  And I'm going to move this chair out of the way, so we can see what we're doing.

105
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.800
I can duplicate this wall panel simply by clicking on it,

106
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.800
holding down the Alt Key A l t, which is to the left of your Spacebar

107
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.800
or to the left of Cmd on a Mac and then of course immediately to the left of the Spacebar on a PC. If you hold

108
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.800
down Alt while you drag, look what happens! It creates a duplicate! Ah hah,

109
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.800
that's pretty cool! OK. I can position that and, of course, I can use the

110
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.800
R Key to go into the Scale Tool and

111
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.800
I can then scale this down. And if it's not scaling how I want it,

112
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.800
then I can change the Scale snap factor, but I've found that by putting

113
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.800
two 400 by 300 wall panels and then putting a third

114
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.800
400 by 300 wall panel in that,

115
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.800
I can actually scale it to 0.25 and it precisely fits. Again, I'll have this lighting

116
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.800
preview issue, but that's go when I rebuilt the lighting. Can you see now how it's relatively

117
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.800
easy to build up an entire level here. I could take this guy, I

118
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.800
could get it into Translate Mode, just find the key W.

119
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.800
I could hold down Alt

120
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.800
to create an alternative version of that or something. I don't know how you want

121
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.800
to remember it, and then, I can spin it around 90 degrees, looking for that 90. I

122
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.800
can come and just double check that this is correct in here. I think it

123
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.800
is, in this case. Good! And now, I can start taking a bigger

124
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.800
wall panel and duplicating that, or to be honest, sometimes it's easier just to

125
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.800
drop a new panel in, just do whatever is easiest. And again, you might want to go back to this

126
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.800
top view here, scroll it with the Right Mouse Button, and I think you're starting to

127
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.800
get the idea right, about how we place these things. By the way, remember that we can move something

128
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.800
just in the ground plane, by selecting this square here. You see where I'm

129
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.800
selected, the little right angle. Any

130
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.800
point just moves in the two axes that comprise the right angle, so that's a useful

131
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.800
axis locking tip. OK, so we've got one little gap to close up there,

132
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.800
and it should all be fine! So, that is the outline of my room! I'm

133
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.800
just going to go ahead and put a couple more things in. Just remember it's Alt

134
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.800
if you want to duplicate, just to finish off here. And then,

135
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.800
I'll close my room up. I may leave the roof open just to keep it bright for now,

136
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.800
and then, what we'll do is we'll come back and look at materials. Now look, we have a slight issue

137
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.800
here that the wall is over-hanging, and that is because of the way that this

138
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.800
is butting together here. So, are we going to worry about that? I think that it is

139
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.800
important that we get this right, once we have more than one room.

140
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.800
OK, but that's a finer tool, I just want you getting used to the gross

141
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.800
manipulations here, for now. So, what I want you to do is just finish off your

142
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.800
room or your series of rooms. You can always put another floor panel or series of floor panels

143
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.800
down, and then, once you've done that, maximize it up, grab yourself a screen

144
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.800
capture tool, and share your creation in the discussions, probably after you've

145
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.800
rebuilt the lighting.

146
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.800
OK welcome back! So, I am just going to quickly

147
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.800
make myself the rest of this room. I'm going to pull this guy over here

148
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.800
into rotate, with the E Key. I wish they would have made it R. I guess we can remap

149
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.800
them if we really wanted. And let's just go, probably from the

150
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.800
top view, because I think it's much easier to lay walls in a top view. That looks like

151
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.800
it's right, looks like it's woo right-click. It looks like it's 1 unit off. There

152
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.800
you go boom! And even from the top view I can do this business of holding down

153
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.800
Alt dragging, and you see how I get myself another panel. Now, eventually what's

154
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.800
going to happen is, we're going to make a real mess of our hierarchy,

155
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.800
what we call the World Outliner here. And, at some point, we're going to make a

156
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.800
folder, and we can do that right now, by right-clicking in the World Outliner

157
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.800
Tab and saying Create Folder and we can call it Walls. I'm going to

158
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.800
delete the other extraneous folder, and then you can take everything that's called a wall, if you wish

159
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.800
including the wall with the door frame, and just pop it into the Walls folder, like that.

160
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.800
Put the Walls folder wherever you like. It's going to float to the top, because it's a folder,

161
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.800
and then, that's just a lot tidier isn't it! All the walls can be collapsed down, and the

162
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.800
thing doesn't look so ugly. Cool, so just finish off!

163
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.800
We already have that half panel over here, so I can Alt

164
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.800
drag... Oops, that was Shift dragging, you've got to look at where your fingers are! Alt drag

165
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.800
that panel into the right place, it's roughly in the right

166
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.800
place there. And you get pretty quick at this, when you start using it a lot,

167
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.800
and you start getting used to where you need to be snapping, etc. So, that

168
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.800
ugliness is normal, what you just want to make sure is the gap is closed. Now, we've got a double

169
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.800
problem on the edge here, compounded by it's very similar to the problem on this

170
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.800
side. Is it twice as big or about the same? It's twice as big. But we're going to live with those

171
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.800
for now. We just want the interior of the room to look good, and as I say, later we will

172
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.800
do the good thing of making sure that the exterior dimensions are right

173
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.800
as well. And BSP, you could just adjust the face, but for now, we're going to just

174
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.800
block it out using these Static Meshes, to see what the pros and cons of them

175
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.800
are. I'll say the main prolonged term is the that they're more performant,

176
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.800
they are faster to render than the other guys. OK, so nearly

177
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.800
there. What I'm doing, because I can't see my keyboard with my

178
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.800
mic in the way, is I just keep hitting Shift instead of Alt.

179
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.800
So, it's Alt that you want to do your duplication, and then, we want a

180
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.800
final thing, which I think I'm going to grab from here,

181
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.800
duplicate it across. And hopefully you've got the idea, it's relatively simple

182
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.800
to lay these levels out. They've done this on purpose, of course, they've given us really useful tools.

183
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.800
What, I got lost. Where am I? There I am, perfect!

184
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.800
Bring it in and then I'm going to make them

185
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.800
butt up against each other perfectly, that way, but let them overlap on the outside. Now, if I just go

186
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.800
ahead and rebuild my lighting, then these ugly lighting preview issues

187
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.800
will go away. I'm also going to show you another thing, which is we could do with some lighting in this

188
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.800
scene. If you want a work light, in the scene to be getting on with, then I'll show you how

189
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.800
to do that, but before I do that, I'm going to show you how to find yourself, you'll get lost again.

190
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.800
I've clicked away, done things too fast, and ended up miles away! How do I end up

191
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.800
back in the middle? Well, one way is you double-click on Player Start and that will get you very

192
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.800
close to the start, and then, you can use your normal W, S, A, D keys to get yourself

193
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.800
back. Alright, if you want a work light, then there's a way of doing that! What you

194
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.800
can do to get a work light is, you hold down the L Key and double-click. It's a little bit fiddly, as

195
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.800
you saw there. It's not 100% perfect but let me just show you that

196
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.800
again. It brings in what we call a point light into the scene. You hold down the L Key

197
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.800
and you double-click. If it doesn't work, you try again. Maybe you need to let

198
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.633
go of L and try again, and eventually you will get that work light in place.

199
00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:14.633
Hi there, this is Sam again! This is just a quick post edit to point out

200
00:13:14.633 --> 00:13:18.633
that, if you're struggling with this particular keyboard combination, the L and double-click,

201
00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:22.633
another way is to do a Shift L and just a single click and

202
00:13:22.633 --> 00:13:25.733
that seems to be more reliable in this instance.

203
00:13:25.733 --> 00:13:25.800


204
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.800
And then, the work light, as I said as a point light, and then you can just move it to where you

205
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.800
want, just so you can see what you're doing when you're level building, literally like you're under

206
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.800
scaffolding. And that's filled in those shadows there. I think the chair would look better if

207
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.800
it was up against a wall perhaps, and then, that's it we're done!

208
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.800
I would do a final lighting rebuild, and then, I would take a screenshot and share it in

209
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.800
the discussions. Now, I want to make sure that you are making your commits, your

210
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.800
commits to your version control. So, I am going to

211
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.800
leave Visual Studio, because I want all of the lock files to be closed. I want to

212
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.800
go to File and Save All inside Unreal,

213
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.800
close that, and then, over here in my version control, the changes are

214
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.800
basically, there's a Visual Studio file just because I opened and closed it. We can actually ignore

215
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.800
.suo's, we'll do that very shortly I think, and then, you'll

216
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.800
also have here a .umap, which is the actual map that we changed.

217
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.800
So, this is where I'll be making my commit, stage all of those, Commit, and off we go!

218
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.800
Cool! So well done, you've started to build a level, and I will see you in the next video!

219
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.533
