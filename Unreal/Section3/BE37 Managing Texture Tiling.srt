1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. welcome to Managing

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Texture Tiling! In this video. you may want to

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
resize objects. for example. wall panels. ceiling panels. etc.. and doing

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so will stretch the texture and it may look odd. so you may have even avoided

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
certain textures because of that. Well. we want to fix this issue. You can rescale a texture in

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a few ways but one way is in the material blueprint. I think it's the most natural

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
way. because that's where we adjust the material. And I want to say straight

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
away that one of the things we're going to be looking at is something called UV Mapping. and you might wonder why

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
they're the letters U and V. It's basically because we ran out of letters. but I'll explain that

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
when we're in there. Now. at the end of the video. I will have made a small adjustment to my

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
world where I have this ceiling. which would have started off looking really strange

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and stretched. and I've showed you how to reposition it. resize it. and actually

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500
adjust the texture. So. let's dive in and see how it works!

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.500
OK. so let's look at this issue of texturing! I'm going to use my

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.500
ceiling or my roof. my glass ceiling. as an example. You guys might want to

16
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.500
use something else. like maybe you've got some walls that you've tried stretching and the textures

17
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.500
have gone a little bit wrong. So. let's take a look! Firstly.

18
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500
I'm going to get my ceiling the right size before I start. It's good to get the things

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.500
the right physical size. before we worry about adjusting the texture to

20
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.500
them. So. where it is! I'm going to use the Scale Tool. which I can get to with the R Key.

21
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.500
and I'm just going to scale down this roof panel and move it so I'm switching

22
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.500
between hitting R and W. until I get it how I want. Now.

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.500
remember that you've got a top view. and feel free to go to the top view with

24
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.500
this minimize button and then maximize the top view.

25
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.500
And then. in the top view. I can see both the position of

26
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.500
the roof and of all the walls below it. So then.

27
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.500
when I come to rescale. etc. I can do it much quicker if I'm in

28
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.500
this view. So. here we go. I can pull it down.

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.500
and then. remember also your snapping options up here. You can choose to snap at a different

30
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500
rate if you need to. OK. so that's going to

31
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500
help you to get the roof exactly the right size. so that it just fits over.

32
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.500
So. this may apply to your walls or whatever. Now. I'm not going to make it absolutely precise.

33
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.500
it's not worth me spending the time. but you get the idea of moving it around

34
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.500
and getting it pretty much right. Now. the question is. I want to change the

35
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.500
texture on it. so how do I do that? With the SM_GlassWindow

36
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.500
selected. you need the Details Panel. which I've closed by mistake.

37
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.500
So. what we have here is a glass window. at the moment. I'm going to stick with a glass window.

38
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.500
in my case. and I'm just going to change the material on it. So. let's go to the

39
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.500
Material Editor there. and I'm going to go to the View Options and make the thumb

40
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.500
nails a lot larger. So. we are. just to

41
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.500
recap. Material is against the Materials section. I've gone to the

42
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.966
drop-down arrow to get this pane up. and I've gone to View Options

43
00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:51.500
to make the thumbnails larger. then. I can see the materials options. Now. one of our students

44
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.500
used. I think. this hex tile or was it the one below?

45
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.500
It was Tile_Pulse I think? Yeah. Tile_Pulse!

46
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.500
There it was! So. I'm using Tile_Pulse in this case. Now. what's wrong with it? Well.

47
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.500
what's wrong with it is the texture is not scaled properly. We look at the object

48
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.500
itself. the roof object. We can see that it has a scale of 10.25.

49
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.500
Let's make that a nice round 10 by 5.

50
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.500
Make that a nice round 5. just recenter.

51
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.500
So. I'm going to make it precisely a scale of

52
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.500
1 in the X. 10. and then 5.

53
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.500
OK. and it won't quite do that and that's because of the way it's

54
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.500
locking the uniformity of the scaling. It's saying that this thing

55
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.500
previously had a none-integer scale. so you can turn off the lock

56
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500
to make that give you all the flexibility you want alright.

57
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.500
Then remember that you can drag in the X Y plane. by carefully selecting

58
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.500
here. And now. that roof does actually fit quite well. and it's scaled

59
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.500
to actual round numbers. Now. that's going to be important in a minute!

60
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Let's go and look at this texture in the Texture Editor! What I'm going to do

61
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500
is make the Unreal Editor only half of the screen like that. Then.

62
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500
I'm going to go to the texture. Now. one way to get to it is to just click on the magnifying

63
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.500
glass. Now. before you edit this texture you've got a choice.

64
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.500
Do you want to use the actual texture and edit that. or do you want to make a copy

65
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.500
of it? Well. I think we're going to make a copy of this. I'm going to Duplicate

66
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.500
it. I'm going to call it My_

67
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Pulse. and I'm going to put that. actually.

68
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.500
straight in Content. not in the Starter Pack alright.

69
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Now. where has it gone? If you lose something

70
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.500
you can search and then you can look and see it's still in Starter Content.

71
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.500
Materials. So. let me try and move it again. My_Pulse.

72
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.500
Move or copy My_Pulse. and then I miss this dialog. Move Here.

73
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.500
So I've just moved it back to Content. and that means that

74
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.500
I can find it easily and it's not confused with any StarterContent.

75
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.500
So the roof. I'm going to change its material instance to My_Pulse.

76
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.500
I can search and therefore I'm not changing

77
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.500
the one that's in the StarterPack. It also means that if you .getignore that your changes will get

78
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.500
saved. OK. so it's My_Pulse that we're going to change! Great! Let's go

79
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.500
into it. into the Material Editor. I'm going to put this on the right-hand side so we can see. on the left

80
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.500
here. the actual roof in question and how it's looking

81
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.500
OK. and then. on the right-hand side we've got the Node Editor for the materials. Now. we briefly

82
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.500
popped in here before. but the bit that we need to worry about is

83
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.500
if the material is setup properly. Then. you would hope that somewhere on the

84
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.500
left-hand side. probably. you'll have a Text Coord node. Texture

85
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.500
Coordinate node. OK. If you click on that. you can see

86
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500
here we have UTiling. VTiling. Now. what's U and

87
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.500
V about? Well. at some point we've got to map the coordinates. the

88
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.500
X Y coordinates. if you like. or the row column coordinates of the

89
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.500
texture to the actual object. but we're using X. Y. Z in the world

90
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.500
here and we've run out of letters. so we use U and V like X and

91
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.500
Y. Alright. so these are the X and Y coordinates of the texture!

92
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.500
So. just grab your UTiling and then try changing it. Now. you're going to have to

93
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.500
click Apply for it to actually apply back to the world.

94
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.500
And if we say 10 for the UTiling. let's try that!

95
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.500
And this entirely depends on how much density you want. Let's try

96
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.500
10 for the VTiling. Apply.

97
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.500
OK. that kind of looks

98
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.500
OK. I probably want to have the VTiling the other way

99
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.500
a little bit more or less. I think. I think it's more

100
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.500
because what I'm trying to aim to achieve is that. the way this roof is stretched.

101
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.500
I want it to look fairly uniform. It doesn't have to be perfectly square.

102
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.500
So. that was the wrong way. so I go 5. So. sure you can be

103
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.500
more methodical and work out what you should be putting in these places. but obviously a quick

104
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.500
doubling and harving. a binary search again. this can be a good way! Look

105
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.500
that looks pretty even! So. let's go inside the room. back in the game.

106
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.500
In fact. I'm going to give myself a luxury of a full screen view with F11. and

107
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.500
it's much darker in here now. so we'll sort that out with the light in a minute. But I've got a roof that

108
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.500
has a texture on it that isn't tiled too strangely. so that's pretty cool!

109
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.500
Alright. so all I'm going to do now is fill the room in with a little bit of light.

110
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.500
Let's go and have a look! F11 we're going to find some Starter

111
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.500
Content. Let's go find some props

112
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.500
and ceiling lights or wall lights. I think we could probably

113
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.500
just use wall lights here. What else have I got?

114
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.500
Hmm? I could turn the brightness of this

115
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.500
guy up a lot. that should bounce around. Let's do that for a start!

116
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.500
How are we looking? I

117
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.500
actually don't mind it being pretty dark in the corner here. because it kind of gives some affordance.

118
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.500
I think. actually. I've overdone that light. Let's bring it back down. I don't mind it being

119
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.500
dark in this room. You're welcome to add as many lights as you want. but this kind of

120
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.500
indicates where we want to go. it's into this dark corner. So. I'm happy

121
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.500
with that! Alright. so that's it! That's how you adjust your

122
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.500
texture tiling! So. what I want you to do now is to adjust your textures. Experiment with

123
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.500
new textures. So. now you can be bold. You may have avoided textures

124
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.500
earlier in the section. because they didn't tile properly. Adjust the tiling. as I've just showed you.

125
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.500
Share the results in the course. Please take some screenshots. share them around. show off your work.

126
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.500
I've seen some amazing results! Don't be put off by other peoples' work. if it's better than you think

127
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.500
you can achieve. just share what you've got and it's all good just doing and

128
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.500
sharing is all good. So. see you in a moment!

129
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.500
OK. welcome back! I'm only coming back because I normally

130
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.500
come back from challenges. and it may be confusing for you if I don't. So. I'm back but

131
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.500
nothing to do right! I hope you've gone to the discussion and you shared your awesome

132
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.500
graphical results. and yeah. I shall see you in the next video!

133
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.233


=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, welcome to Managing

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Texture Tiling! In this video, you may want to

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
resize objects, for example, wall panels, ceiling panels, etc., and doing

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so will stretch the texture and it may look odd, so you may have even avoided

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
certain textures because of that. Well, we want to fix this issue. You can rescale a texture in

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
a few ways but one way is in the material blueprint. I think it's the most natural

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
way, because that's where we adjust the material. And I want to say straight

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
away that one of the things we're going to be looking at is something called UV Mapping, and you might wonder why

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
they're the letters U and V. It's basically because we ran out of letters, but I'll explain that

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
when we're in there. Now, at the end of the video, I will have made a small adjustment to my

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
world where I have this ceiling, which would have started off looking really strange

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and stretched, and I've showed you how to reposition it, resize it, and actually

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,500
adjust the texture. So, let's dive in and see how it works!

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
OK, so let's look at this issue of texturing! I'm going to use my

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
ceiling or my roof, my glass ceiling, as an example. You guys might want to

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
use something else, like maybe you've got some walls that you've tried stretching and the textures

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
have gone a little bit wrong. So, let's take a look! Firstly,

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm going to get my ceiling the right size before I start. It's good to get the things

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
the right physical size, before we worry about adjusting the texture to

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
them. So, where it is! I'm going to use the Scale Tool, which I can get to with the R Key,

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,500
and I'm just going to scale down this roof panel and move it so I'm switching

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,500
between hitting R and W, until I get it how I want. Now,

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
remember that you've got a top view, and feel free to go to the top view with

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
this minimize button and then maximize the top view.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
And then, in the top view, I can see both the position of

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
the roof and of all the walls below it. So then,

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
when I come to rescale, etc. I can do it much quicker if I'm in

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,500
this view. So, here we go, I can pull it down,

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
and then, remember also your snapping options up here. You can choose to snap at a different

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
rate if you need to. OK, so that's going to

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
help you to get the roof exactly the right size, so that it just fits over.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
So, this may apply to your walls or whatever. Now, I'm not going to make it absolutely precise,

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
it's not worth me spending the time, but you get the idea of moving it around

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
and getting it pretty much right. Now, the question is, I want to change the

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
texture on it, so how do I do that? With the SM_GlassWindow

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
selected, you need the Details Panel, which I've closed by mistake.

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
So, what we have here is a glass window, at the moment. I'm going to stick with a glass window,

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,500
in my case, and I'm just going to change the material on it. So, let's go to the

39
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Material Editor there, and I'm going to go to the View Options and make the thumb

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
nails a lot larger. So, we are, just to

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
recap, Material is against the Materials section. I've gone to the

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,966
drop-down arrow to get this pane up, and I've gone to View Options

43
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:51,500
to make the thumbnails larger, then, I can see the materials options. Now, one of our students

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
used, I think, this hex tile or was it the one below?

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
It was Tile_Pulse I think? Yeah, Tile_Pulse!

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,500
There it was! So, I'm using Tile_Pulse in this case. Now, what's wrong with it? Well,

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
what's wrong with it is the texture is not scaled properly. We look at the object

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
itself, the roof object. We can see that it has a scale of 10.25.

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Let's make that a nice round 10 by 5.

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Make that a nice round 5, just recenter.

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
So, I'm going to make it precisely a scale of

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
1 in the X, 10, and then 5.

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
OK, and it won't quite do that and that's because of the way it's

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
locking the uniformity of the scaling. It's saying that this thing

55
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
previously had a none-integer scale, so you can turn off the lock

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
to make that give you all the flexibility you want alright.

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Then remember that you can drag in the X Y plane, by carefully selecting

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,500
here. And now, that roof does actually fit quite well, and it's scaled

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
to actual round numbers. Now, that's going to be important in a minute!

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Let's go and look at this texture in the Texture Editor! What I'm going to do

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
is make the Unreal Editor only half of the screen like that. Then,

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm going to go to the texture. Now, one way to get to it is to just click on the magnifying

63
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
glass. Now, before you edit this texture you've got a choice.

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Do you want to use the actual texture and edit that, or do you want to make a copy

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,500
of it? Well, I think we're going to make a copy of this. I'm going to Duplicate

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
it, I'm going to call it My_

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Pulse, and I'm going to put that, actually,

68
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,500
straight in Content, not in the Starter Pack alright.

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Now, where has it gone? If you lose something

70
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
you can search and then you can look and see it's still in Starter Content,

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Materials. So, let me try and move it again, My_Pulse.

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Move or copy My_Pulse, and then I miss this dialog, Move Here.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
So I've just moved it back to Content, and that means that

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I can find it easily and it's not confused with any StarterContent.

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
So the roof, I'm going to change its material instance to My_Pulse.

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I can search and therefore I'm not changing

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
the one that's in the StarterPack. It also means that if you .getignore that your changes will get

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,500
saved. OK, so it's My_Pulse that we're going to change! Great! Let's go

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,500
into it, into the Material Editor. I'm going to put this on the right-hand side so we can see, on the left

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
here, the actual roof in question and how it's looking

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
OK, and then, on the right-hand side we've got the Node Editor for the materials. Now, we briefly

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
popped in here before, but the bit that we need to worry about is

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
if the material is setup properly. Then, you would hope that somewhere on the

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
left-hand side, probably, you'll have a Text Coord node, Texture

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Coordinate node, OK. If you click on that, you can see

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
here we have UTiling, VTiling. Now, what's U and

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
V about? Well, at some point we've got to map the coordinates, the

88
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,500
X Y coordinates, if you like, or the row column coordinates of the

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,500
texture to the actual object, but we're using X, Y, Z in the world

90
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,500
here and we've run out of letters, so we use U and V like X and

91
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Y. Alright, so these are the X and Y coordinates of the texture!

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
So, just grab your UTiling and then try changing it. Now, you're going to have to

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
click Apply for it to actually apply back to the world.

94
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,500
And if we say 10 for the UTiling, let's try that!

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,500
And this entirely depends on how much density you want. Let's try

96
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
10 for the VTiling, Apply.

97
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,500
OK, that kind of looks

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,500
OK. I probably want to have the VTiling the other way

99
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,500
a little bit more or less, I think. I think it's more

100
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,500
because what I'm trying to aim to achieve is that, the way this roof is stretched,

101
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,500
I want it to look fairly uniform. It doesn't have to be perfectly square.

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,500
So, that was the wrong way, so I go 5. So, sure you can be

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,500
more methodical and work out what you should be putting in these places, but obviously a quick

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
doubling and harving, a binary search again, this can be a good way! Look

105
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,500
that looks pretty even! So, let's go inside the room, back in the game.

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,500
In fact, I'm going to give myself a luxury of a full screen view with F11, and

107
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
it's much darker in here now, so we'll sort that out with the light in a minute. But I've got a roof that

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
has a texture on it that isn't tiled too strangely, so that's pretty cool!

109
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Alright, so all I'm going to do now is fill the room in with a little bit of light.

110
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Let's go and have a look! F11 we're going to find some Starter

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Content. Let's go find some props

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,500
and ceiling lights or wall lights. I think we could probably

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,500
just use wall lights here. What else have I got?

114
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Hmm? I could turn the brightness of this

115
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,500
guy up a lot, that should bounce around. Let's do that for a start!

116
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
How are we looking? I

117
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
actually don't mind it being pretty dark in the corner here, because it kind of gives some affordance.

118
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,500
I think, actually, I've overdone that light. Let's bring it back down. I don't mind it being

119
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,500
dark in this room. You're welcome to add as many lights as you want, but this kind of

120
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
indicates where we want to go, it's into this dark corner. So, I'm happy

121
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
with that! Alright, so that's it! That's how you adjust your

122
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,500
texture tiling! So, what I want you to do now is to adjust your textures. Experiment with

123
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
new textures. So, now you can be bold. You may have avoided textures

124
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,500
earlier in the section, because they didn't tile properly. Adjust the tiling, as I've just showed you.

125
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Share the results in the course. Please take some screenshots, share them around, show off your work.

126
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I've seen some amazing results! Don't be put off by other peoples' work, if it's better than you think

127
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
you can achieve, just share what you've got and it's all good just doing and

128
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
sharing is all good. So, see you in a moment!

129
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
OK, welcome back! I'm only coming back because I normally

130
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
come back from challenges, and it may be confusing for you if I don't. So, I'm back but

131
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
nothing to do right! I hope you've gone to the discussion and you shared your awesome

132
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
graphical results, and yeah, I shall see you in the next video!

133
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,233
