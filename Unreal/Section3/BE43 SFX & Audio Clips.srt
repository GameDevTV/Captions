1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
welcome to SFX & Audio Clips! In this video, we're going to trigger

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a simple sound in Blueprint. Later in the course, we'll use C++ as well,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
however we'll always reference our assets via Blueprint, so that we're not

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
hardcoding them into the code so that we can rename them, basically.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll be showing you how to trigger a 3D sound. That's a sound that emanates from the position of the door,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
when the engine will start to work out how that sounds from the player's position, so that's kind of fun!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, let's dive in and see how it works! So, welcome back!

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You should find the sound file, that I'm going to be using, attached to this

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
very lecture. And I want to say a big thank you

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to Gamemaster Audio! You can Google for Gamemaster Audio, for providing

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
me with this free sound file, and also, there'll be some other sound files in this

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
course. It's part of the Pro Sound Collection, you can see here, and I do

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
encourage you to check these guys out. It's very kind of them to donate it for

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
us, for free, for this course. Now, the deal is, you're allowed to use it as part of the

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
course, but if you want to use this sound file in a commercial game or

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
for any other game, you do need to get in touch with Gamemaster Audio

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and either purchase their collection or ask them for permission. So, with that

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
said, go grab the sound file and let's go to the Content Browser. I'm going to make myself

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
a new folder called Audio, here in the Content Browser. And then,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
in that folder I'm going to import from... Now, in my case, I have it

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
in this Building Escape folder here, but you will need to go download it. Or you can use your own

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
sound file or just get a microphone out or your iPhone or your Android phone and

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Windows phone and slam a door. [Laughs] Whatever, get a sound file. Just a .wav is fine!

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
An .mp3 is fine too! I'm using a .wav here. So, here's this door_

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
lock sound. Now, we can play this! Here you go, by right-

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
clicking on it, you can do all sorts of things. You can create a cue, but look, for

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
now I'm going to show you just how to do this in Blueprint, because we're already defining

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the behavior of the door, here in Blueprint. And we're not going to go much further

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
with this Blueprint, because this is, of course, about C++, but I'm going to finish this

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
door behavior off by just putting a sound in. If we get much more complicated than this, I

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
would be inclined to go back to C++ and use more C++, because these things just become

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
horribly unwieldy if there's too many of them. Alright, so you've got your

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
sound available inside Unreal. If you can...

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I just need to minimize this. If you can find the sound in the Content Browser and

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
play it, like you hear it going there, then you know it's working.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Then, what I want you to do is to work out how to make the sound play yourself.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, get the sound working, get the sound effects playing

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
on your own, consider making or finding other sound effects,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and why not make a short video using Snagit or Jing

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or something, and then, share the results of what you've

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
done, in terms of your sound. And maybe you're trying to make some music, whatever, push the boat out

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
a bit here and add some sound to the game, and just see if you can get at least this door sound

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
working, by discovering the appropriate Blueprint notes yourself. And if you're

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
struggling, come back and I'll show you how to do it.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, welcome back!

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Here we go, into the Blueprint for the

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
door. Now, what we want to do is, we search. Either drill into Audio here or

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
search for Audio. Now, we're going to Play Sound at Location. Sounds are 3D if you

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
do them this way, so Play Sound at Location. When are we going to play

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the sound? Now, this is the bit that may have been a bit of a challenge for you.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How do you know when you're going to play the sound? Well, what we can do on

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
this Door Swing, and look it's perfectly alright if you couldn't work this out for yourself. I wanted to put

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
a bigger challenge in here, so that you could  get your teeth really stuck into something.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So, go into the Door Swing, and you add yourself an Event Track.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
OK, I'm going to call this Sound Timing,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and I'm just going to add a node here, at lets say point

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
1 of a second. The value doesn't matter, because we're not using the value, but I'll set the value to

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
0. So, 0.1 of a second, after the door starts to open, an event

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
will be fired. What does that mean? Well, look over here! We get a Sound Timing

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Execution Pin. We can pipe that like so,

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to move this all along, into the Play Sound at Location.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, what happens is, as we go along this timeline, we can compare the two,

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
then just after the door started to open we get a little bit of a sound. You might want to do it early or

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
later, it's up to you. You can move it graphically, it's easy! What's the location?

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, we getactor location, so we want to play the sound emanating

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
from where the door is. And what's the sound asset? Well,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we go into and search for door, door lock. That's as simple

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
as that! Let's try it!

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You hear that?! Perfect! And then, you close

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and you get the same sound again! Now, you're going to say to me, I'm sure, in the

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
discussions of the course, how about if we want to have more than one sound,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
different sounds, playing at the start and the finish? Well, of course, it can be

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
done! Anything can be done here in Blueprint, anything can be done in code. If you want to do that, I'm going to

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
leave it as an exercise to the reader, because this, as I say, is a C++ course. I'm only adding

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the sound in here, in order to make things more

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
complete for you, and I don't really want to make a spaghetti-fied

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
complicated blueprint. You know, if a blueprint

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
doesn't sit on the screen like this, it gets too big too hard to follow, and I've

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
seen a lot of tutorials that are really hard to follow with Blueprint. So, yes you can do it! No, it's not that difficult.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, you have to think about what state we're in and exactly when you

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
play it. Of course you can work it out! Of course I can work it out! I encourage you to have a go if you

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
want to get better at Blueprint, but if you don't want to get better at Blueprint, let's crack on! Let's

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
get on with the next section, where we're going to be focusing on a whole new slew of

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
things that we can do! It's relatively easy to deal with sounds in C++ as well,

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and I'll be showing you how to do that, later in the course. What we will always be doing

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is referencing our sounds through Blueprint; i.e. we won't be

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
hardcoding a reference, inside of our game, to the

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
actual asset name here, because we want to be able to rename this

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
with ease and without worrying about it. So, we will always be referencing via Blueprint,

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
even when we do things in C++. So, that's it,

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
we're pretty much finished with this section! Maybe a little bit more polishing to do in the next

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
few videos, I will leave that open, but we have all

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
of what we need to make a very simple Building Escape game. You've got plenty of mechanics, it's up to you now

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to go and do what some of the students have done, which is make incredibly impressive

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and elaborate Building Escapes, using sounds, pressure pads, and you could come up with

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,400
some novel game mechanics of your own, that use what you have already learned. So, see you soon!
