00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey. so welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Modifying the Default Pawn Actor! In this video. we'll talk about why Blueprint

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is helpful. I'll tell you right now. Blueprint is helpful when you are making

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
templates of assets. because

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it's very visual. it's very clear in the Editor what you're changing. and you're preventing yourself from

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
hard coding changes and assets into actual C++ code. which means that

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
if you want to change the name of an asset. for example. then the editor will track those changes.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'll show you how to make a Blueprint from the Default Pawn.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Note this Blueprint class inherits from the Default

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Pawn. So. Blueprint class is based on the C++ class. it is a

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
relationship. Blueprint is like a

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
template. As I said before. it's like it sounds. it's a plan for building something.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And you can make an instance in the scene of a given Blueprint template.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we'll be doing that. and we will explore instantiating from Blueprint.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which is exactly what I just said. It's creating an instance. it's instantiating

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and then modifying the thing that's in the scene and seeing that. that doesn't change the Blueprint.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So. the blueprint is a template. basically. So. let's dive in and see all of this happen!

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.400


19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.400
So. let's see how we're going to get a handle on this Default Pawn. Remember.

20
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.400
that when we start the game and we eject ourselves. the Player Controller.

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
from the Pawn Body there. there it is. that this pawn that's being

22
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.400
spawned into the world. which is available in the World Outliner here as Default Pawn 1.

23
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.400
is being specified by the GameMode under Project Settings.

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.400
Maps & Modes. and then. if you go into the detail of the GameMode.

25
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.400
it's here. It's grayed out because this is a

26
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.400
C++ GameMode and you'd have to specify this in code. We're going to make a

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.400
Blueprint version. so that we can specify it here in the Editor later. but

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.400
for now. what we want to do is better see how we can modify the pawn. So. how do we do that?

29
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.400
Well. so with the game running. click on your Default Pawn that has spawned.

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400
Go to the Blueprints Menu and say.

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.400
Convert Selected Actor to Blueprint Class.

32
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400
OK. you'll get a name. I'm going to call it DefaultPawn

33
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.400
_BP. for our blueprint

34
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.400
Default Pawn. There you go. that is done! OK. let's just close

35
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400
the Blueprint Editor. for the moment. and stop to see what we've done. So.

36
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400
with the game stopped and under Content your new DefaultPawn blueprint

37
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.400
available. note that you can drag it into the world. and it's just a copy. just

38
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.400
the blueprint of the very pawn that was being spawned.

39
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.400
because we based it on the existing Default Pawn. So. if we double-

40
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.400
click it. look up here at the top-right. Parent class Default

41
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.400
Pawn. OK. So. this is no different to the

42
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.400
other Default Pawn. but the crucial thing is we can change this now. We can actually make changes

43
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400
to the Default Pawn. so double-click. If you get this screen. which is only showing

44
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.400
the Class Defaults Tab. you can click Open Full Blueprint

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.400
Editor. and that will then open this. which has the default tabs on the right but

46
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.400
we have various other things. Now. we don't need to worry ourselves about Event Graph or

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400
Construction Script windows yet. but. in the Viewport. you'll see the Default

48
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.400
Pawn and you'll see that you can manipulate it. You could rescale it. for example. using the

49
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400
R Key. and that's exactly what I want you to do now. I want

50
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.400
you to try making a Rugby Ball Pawn! Modify the Default Pawn somehow.

51
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.400
i.e. as in not that it's a mystery how. I've just shown you how. but

52
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.400
change it somehow. For example. scaling on one axis. Create an instance.

53
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.400
once you've done that. by dragging it into the world. So. close the Blueprint Editor and then

54
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.400
drake your Default Pawn Blueprint. like I did a moment ago.

55
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.400
from your Content Browser and drop it into the world. and see how

56
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.400
modifying the instance... So. go into your world. modify

57
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.400
the thing. the instance of this Default Pawn you've created. and note that it

58
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.400
doesn't change the blueprint. OK. And then. when you finish. just

59
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.400
revert whatever change you made to the Default Pawn. So. I know the instructions are

60
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.400
not absolutely step by step and that's on purpose. because how are you going to get any good

61
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.400
at manipulating the Unreal Engine. if you don't work things out for yourself. So. go ahead. pause

62
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.400
the video. and see if you can make sense of that now!

63
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.400
OK. welcome back! So. let's just take a look! Here he is! I'm going to scale

64
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.400
the pawn there. Now. the bit you may have noticed

65
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.400
is. you need to click Compile. If you just click Save or you just exit let's try it. let's see what

66
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.400
happens. There it is! There's the Default Pawn! Let's drag it in. you see

67
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.400
the new version that I just dragged in has not taken on those changes.

68
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.400
I'm going to delete with the delete key. Let's go back to here and see what the minimum we can do

69
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.400
How about saving the blueprint. does that work? Drag it in. Yes. saving the

70
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.400
blueprint does! OK. the reason the blueprint doesn't need to compile

71
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.400
is because there's nothing compile worthy going on. it's just a scale.

72
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.400
But in general terms. what you're going to want to do. when you edit a blueprint. is just

73
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.400
click Compile. which will also save it and leave. So. I didn't tell you that.

74
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.400
hopefully you discovered it for yourself. There you go! So dragging from Default Pawn. in the

75
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.400
Content Browser into the world. makes an instance of that Default Pawn. There's

76
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.400
two of them. Now. imagine that I scale one of these guys or rotate

77
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.400
it. like this. Now. we have two instances. right. One is just a

78
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.400
rugby ball. one's a rugby ball on its side. but if you look at the Default Pawn

79
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.400
itself. in the Viewport. of course it hasn't changed. it hasn't rotated.

80
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.400
The changes do not get written back. There is a way of writing them back from the world. but. for now. let's

81
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.400
keep things simple. I just want you to understand that you change the Default Pawn here. You can

82
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.400
add components to it. which is what we're going to do now. and that's going to be super handy.

83
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.400
and you can also make various other changes. So. first thing I'm going to do is scale back. OK. so

84
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.400
here is my Default Pawn. I scaled it on the Z axis.

85
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400
and I'm just going to put it back to where it was. like that. OK. Compile

86
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.400
and close and just check by dragging one in. that it looks normal again. It does!

87
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.400
Cool! Going to get rid of all of these weird Default Pawns in the scene.

88
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.400
And now. we're going to talk about adding a component! So. create yourself a

89
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.400
new C++ class. called Grabber. but it's an Actor

90
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.400
Component. because it's going to go on the pawn and the pawn is an Actor. OK. it's a reusable

91
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.400
component! Just call it Grabber.

92
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.400
There it is! So. another one of these nice reusable components. like our Position

93
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.400
Reporter and various other things that we have in the Door Open script.

94
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.400
And let's just let that compile.

95
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.400
because until it's compiled. we won't be able to actually add it to anything.

96
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.400
Well. we may be able to. but let's just let it finish compelling. It doesn't take too long on my machine.

97
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.400
So. there you go! Let's open up an empty

98
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.400
component here. with all the boiler plate code that we've seen before. OK. so back

99
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.400
in Unreal. we now have a Grabber code here you see. Grabber (C++ Class) under

100
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.400
your Content Browser. C++ Classes. and then the name of the game.

101
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.400
Crucially. what we can do now is we can go back to Content and our Default Pawn.

102
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.400
We can add a Component to it. scroll down to Custom components.

103
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.400
and add the Grabber. Compile

104
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.400
and then just exit. Now. when we drop the Default Pawn in the scene. there it is! It looks very similar

105
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.400
but when you inspect it. it actually will have a Grabber on it. Pretty cool hey!

106
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.400
So. this is the reusable object that we are now going to use as a

107
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.400
template. to replace the one that the GameMode inserts when we play.

108
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.400
Remember. when we play. currently if we were to play and then eject immediately.

109
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.400
the one that it creates here does not have

110
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.400
the Grabber on it. and the one that we put in does have a Grabber Component. So what we need

111
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.400
to do next is. look at changing the blueprint for the Game

112
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.400
Mode. because it is the GameMode that determines what the Default Pawn is.

113
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.166
So. there you go. I hope that made sense. and I'll see you soon!
