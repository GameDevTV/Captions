00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. congratulations on yet another complete section!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Obviously the game is not completely finished. but we don't all of the tools we need

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
yet. like the User Interface Tools we would need to put a Menu System on a

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
game like this or scoring. And there's a lot of things

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we can add to make this into a real game. but it's enough to have really got you started.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Just look back at the last 40 or so lectures and see how much you've learned about

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
C++. about Unreal. about Unreal specific C++.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
about Blueprint. ah it goes on. And what I'd really like you to do is

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
just carry on a little bit and just make this your own. Do a little bit more

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
than I've done. Just push the boat out a little bit and then share in the discussions

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
what you've done. and then. proudly and quickly get on straight

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with the next section. Also. attached to the section notes. the

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
slides which are right up at the first lecture. you can go to the Google docs and

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the slides are there. Hopefully you've found the slides useful. I'd like some feedback in the discussions about

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
slides. Do you like them? Do you not like them? Do you use them? Which

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
parts of them do you find most useful? Maybe the challenge slides or they're in this video.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And on this final slide. or the last couple of slides.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
of the entire section. there's a couple of handy little checklists for you. One is how to

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
delete a class in C++. We're likely to be doing this in the next

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
section. for the first time. the first time a name a class wrongly. it's much harder

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
than it should be. There's a step by step process there in the slides. as to how to do it. And

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I just wanted to tell you that now. because if you're experimenting and playing with your project.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
then you might misname something. and feel free to be able to delete

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and start again. But yes. Unreal has made it far to hard to rename a class.

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The other thing to say is. if you are coming from Unity. this is a great time. now

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that you've had enough exposure to Unreal for it to make sense. to look at the docs

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I've linked in the very last slide of the section

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
notes. which is a guide to Unreal development for Unity developers.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And that's really handy. it draws all the parallels for you! So. that's

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it for this section. we''ll be diving straight into the next section. and I will see you in there!

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.466
