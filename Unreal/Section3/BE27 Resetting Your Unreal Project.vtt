00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Resetting Your Unreal Project. So if you find yourself

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in a situation like this, where you open your project, for example...

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And we'll just let it open. It all seems to be OK,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and then, you click play and it just crashes and you can't work out

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
why. I want to show you how to reset your project, especially if you're going to start playing with pointers

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and references and things, so let me show you step-by-step. So in this video,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we're going to tell you what to do if your Unreal solution keeps crashing.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Tell you how to delete all your temporary files. I'll tell you the order in which to reset

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
things and we'll go from there. So, and at the end I'll

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
challenge you to be doing this, so let me overview the steps and then I will

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
do the steps, and then, I'll recap the steps and then you can do it. So, we're going to

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
"check-out" or "Reset" to a working commit. We're going to delete our derived files and folders.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're going to reopen Unreal from the launcher, and I'll explain why in a second,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
then, regenerate our IDE project files. And the reason we need to reopen Unreal

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
at stage 3 is because, among other things, it regenerates the generated .h

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
files in the iIntermediate folder, and these are important for your IDE.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
OK, so that's the plan! Let's see it in action and then I'll recap

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the plan. So, my project doesn't work, it's broken now. How did I get it broken?

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well, if I make things look a little simpler here, I changed my commit.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I was somewhere else OK, so I've done some prototyping, some other work.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I changed to a different place. You may wonder, how would I go back in time

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in my source control? How would I go back a few videos? Well, you either

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Checkout, which goes back but leaves all your working changes, or

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
you reset. Generally you'd reset but it's a potentially destructive operation. I'm not going

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to go through the details of Checkout and reset here, you can ask about it in the discussions or read about it on

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the web. But let's say you've gone somewhere and it's broken. You need to go back,

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
so I'm going to go back to this video at this point

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
OK. And this point should work but it doesn't work right now, so how do I fix

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that? The problem is that some of these files have changed and some others haven't,

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
because of what we're ignoring it's starting to feel like we have better just tracking everything

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in version control. The problem is there are some really big folders in here, and you need to know how Unreal

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
works. So, let's go through the steps one at a time. Step number 1, check out our

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
reset tool working commit. Number 2, delete the derived

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
files and folder. So on a PC that's .vs, you'd skip that on a Mac.

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Binaries, Build, Intermediate, and Saved,

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
they all need to go, the same on Mac and PC. The dot solution file or the dot Xcode

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
file on a Mac, and the VC.db on a PC.

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So you ignore the top and bottom ones on a Mac, and everything else goes on a PC.

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
All of those things can be nuked. OK, now what's step 3?

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's to reopen Unreal, and when you reopen Unreal it's going to say I can't find

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
certain things. It'll talk about .dll's or the first .dll it comes across. Now, by the way, a

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
.dll is an object that has been compiled and is ready to use.

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So it needs to recreate .dll's, Dynamic Link Libraries, but it also

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
importantly needs to recreate in this Intermediate folder. It needs to be

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
recreating a set of things called

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
generated .h files. You'll see them appear in here somewhere. It might be easiest just to search

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
your Intermediate folder for generated .h.

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And here you go, PositionReport.generated.h! For all your classes you've

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
got generated .h files. It needs to recreate those because they are actually #included

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
by the engine for you in your scripts. So, we've opened the engine,

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that's step 3 OK. Step 4 now let's you right-click in

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
a PC and say Generate Visual Studio project files, or on a Mac you do it from within

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Unreal itself, as has been explained. OK,

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
so now you'll recreate in your project files, and we're nearly there at this

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
stage. You should actually find, once you've done that, that your solution does run

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
again, which is awesome! it's all fixed! Now, if

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
you want to be able to edit your solution, you've finally got to go back into

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
your IDE, opening Xcode or Visual Studio.

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
That will do a load of work now, because we nuked all its temporary files. So, it's

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
now going to rebuild itself. So, that's going to take a little

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
while, and when it finishes, everything should work fine. Let me show you a little example of this #Include

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of a generated .h, while we're here. So, let's go to PositionReport.h for example.

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Look at this, #include "PositionReport.generated.h".

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
OK, that happens all boiler plate code by the engine. Remember that's

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in the Intermediate folder. If you want to know that for sure, just do a search, an

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
operating system search, as we just did a minute ago. Look where

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
they all are! All of these generated .h files, if we look at the path,

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
are...not all of them actually um, Yes, all of them.

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The other bits it's finding inside these files, but the actual generating

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
.h files look where they are, they're all inside the Intermediate directory.

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So, to recap the process while Visual Studio

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
goes ahead and rebuilds everything for me, it's like this. Let's just go back a step.

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
1). You "Check-out" or  "Reset" to a working commit. That

75
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
returns most of your folders, depending on what you're ignoring in your source control,

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to a previous state that we're pretty confident works. OK, but it ignores all the

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
ignored folders, like the Intermediate, Build, Binaries, etc. 2). You

78
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
delete all derived files and folder, leaving Config, Content, and Source folders at

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
least and very importantly your .uproject file. All of those things

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
need to stay but all the other things that we've showed you before, the derived files, need to be nuked.

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Then, you reopen Unreal from the Launcher or your .urpoject

82
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
file. Then, it's going to rebuild not only the .dll's but as I just said,

83
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
in the Intermediate folder, it's going to recreate all those generated .h files,

84
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
which you are going to need in your IDE. And then, you regenerate your IDE

85
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
project files, and then, finally you're ready to go. OK, that's just

86
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
a note about the generated .h and intermediates. So that is it,

87
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that's what needs doing to reset a project when it goes topsy turvy, I think it

88
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
is what we'd say over here in England. So, what I want you to do now is actually try it

89
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
yourself. Now number 1, try resetting your solution. It's important you're confident

90
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
how this works; that's why I want you to do it. It's one of these things you'd put off, until it goes wrong,

91
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
but if in doubt at all, close everything which means your IDE and

92
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Unreal. Take a .zip file of the entire folder,

93
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
just right click it and zip it up. Then, follow the steps on the previous slide,

94
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and then finally, if you're in trouble, ask another student for

95
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
help. Please take a good backup, don't blame me if you break it, but I would like you to feel confident

96
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that you can do the reset that I just did by following those steps. So go ahead,

97
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
pause the video, and do that now, and I will see you in the next video

98
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
because I've already showed you how to do it, because I think it's more important that you see it

99
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
first. So good luck, enjoy, share your success or horrible failures in the

100
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
discussions, and I'll see you later!

101
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.400
