00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Getting

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to Know Unreal Editor! In this video, we're going to look at why changes to the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
start scene aren't tracked in our source control, be arranging

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a simple set of windows to work with, we'll be moving around in a 3D Viewport,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
setting up our start map, and committing our work, so that we feel

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,400
comfortable, using simple 3D manipulations and saving our work. So, see you in there!

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
So now, we've got our first opportunity to actually play around inside the Unreal

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Editor. Bear in mind, we're in something called the minimal default level here,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Minimal Default OK. And remember that you can go to Settings and then

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Project Settings and Maps & Modes, and it will show you that that minimum default

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,400
is in the startup content. Now, remember we ignored starter content, because it's a

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,400
large amount of data. So any changes we make in here, for instance I click on the chair

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,400
and get the Translate Tool, which you can access with the W key, if it doesn't come up for you

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,400
and move it up. If I now Save All,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
from File, Save All, and go and have a look at my Source Control, I'll actually see that

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,400
nothing has changed. And the reason that nothing has changed is because we're not tracking changes

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
in this scene. So, the first thing we're going to need to do is make ourselves a new scene or

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
level. I'm going to use those words interchangeably, I'm afraid, but you'll see them used interchangeably. It says

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Level here, but you'll also get the

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
concept of the word scene. So, ignore any SourceTree updates for me for the moment!

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
So, let's do that! Let's go ahead and make a new level! There it is!

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm going to go for default. I want this sky map and that piece of

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
ground texture. I'm going to not bother saving any changes to the minimum default, and I'm going to be

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,400
here. And then, as we've done before, I'm going to save

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,400
this, Save As. Now, this is where I get to give it a name, so My Map.

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,400
We could call it MyMap, that's fine, or NewMap. NewMap will be fine!

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,400
So, NewMap is a reasonable name! That's the name of the level. There

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
it is, NewMap, when I hover over it! And now that that's been saved,

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,400
of course, you need to go to your Project Settings, Maps & Modes, and make

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
sure that this NewMap is the one that both the game would start with

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,400
and the Editor would start with. So, make those changes Project Settings, Maps & Modes,

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,400
and then, next time you load this, we'll be back here which is cool! Now, if

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,400
I just exit Unreal, to be sure of the changes, and then, look in SourceTree; if I wait a minute, we've got some

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Uncommitted Changes. And it's found that

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
the DefaultEngine.ini file, a couple of changes in it. Look it's detected them for us, it's changed the

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Editor and game default map, which is what we did in the interface, but also, we've got this

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
binary file that we can't see the details of, called NewMap.umap, so

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,766
that's what starts to happen when we make changes, which is pretty cool!

39
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:37,766
So, let's dive back into our project

40
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:41,766
and just give you a quick tour of the Editor, and then I'm going to leave you to

41
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:45,766
play around. Now, before I start the tour of the editor, look here inside the

42
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,766
Viewport you've got a little question mark. Click on it, it's going to give you a

43
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:53,766
crib sheet. So, it'll tell you that the Left Mouse Button plus drag up

44
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:57,766
and down, It will actually trolly around. It's a bit weird, it's like pushing a supermarket trolly but it'll

45
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:01,766
tell you that. It'll tell you that you can rotate left and right, like

46
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:05,766
this with the Left Mouse Button, etc. So, just go through those, try using the

47
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:09,766
Right Mouse Button, the Left Mouse Button, and various things. OK, the Mouse

48
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:13,766
Wheel will roll you in and out. Also, you can hold down the Right Mouse Button and use W,

49
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:17,766
S, A, D, also Q and E first person controls. When you're

50
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:21,766
holding down the Right Mouse Button, you can change the speed. If I roll my Mouse Wheel down, I'm

51
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:25,766
doing that now, then I've set the speed to very low, and as I roll the Mouse Wheel up,

52
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:29,766
the speed increases OK. So, bear in mind what current speed you've got

53
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:33,766
set, and I want you to get really comfortable with just moving around. And the other

54
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:37,766
thing is, just pop a prop from the Content Browser.

55
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:41,766
So, find your Content Browser, go to StarterContent, if you're

56
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:45,766
right at the beginning of the ContentBrowser, you might need to get a second pane up in

57
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:49,766
here. Content, StarterContent, Props.

58
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:53,766
Eventually you'll find the chair, for example. Let's put the chair in the scene, you'll notice it just sticks

59
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,766
to the floor. Let me show you one more movement mode. So, we can yes,

60
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:01,766
sure we can move around the chair, with all of these controls I've just shown you, at various different speeds, but

61
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:05,766
this is a Meyer style control. Now, if you click on it, click F

62
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:09,766
to focus that, and then, if you hold down the Alt Key, the left Alt Key is what I'm

63
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:13,766
holding down now, as I move the Left Mouse Button look, I'm rotating around this object.

64
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:17,766
And I can go in and out, either by holding down the Right Mouse Button, that's the smoothest

65
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,766
way, or by using the Mouse Wheel, which can be jerky and also has a kind of minimum distance.

66
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:25,766
So, Right Mouse Button hold down, forward and back, left Mouse

67
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,766
Button around. Now, all of this time, I'm holding down the Alt Key, that's the key here!

68
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:33,766
You could do the same on the floor. You could hit the F key, to focus on the floor, after you've selected it,

69
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:37,766
hold down the Alt Key, holding down Alt now... The Left Mouse Button rotates

70
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:41,766
around, the Right Mouse Button moves in and out. That's a fantastic way of

71
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,766
focusing on a given object and then rotating around and seeing it from all angles.

72
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:49,766
OK, so there's your crib sheet again, in the Viewport there. What I want you to do

73
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:53,766
now is, go and have a good play with the Viewport and get comfortable just

74
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:57,766
placing a few objects on this single ground tile, and just maybe build up a

75
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:01,766
really simple little scene here, with a chair and a bench and whatever. And

76
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:05,766
I'll see you when you come back!

77
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:09,766
Cool, welcome back! So, to bring things into the scene, just show you a few

78
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:13,766
more tricks. You could say, drag a rock in here. The blue arrow constrains

79
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:17,766
in this plane, the green arrow constrains in that plane. One more thing is that you can

80
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:21,766
constrain in two planes at a time by clicking, it's very tricky, but

81
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:25,766
right in here, if I click there in the little intersection of the two, then I'm

82
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:29,766
now moving it in this ground plane, which is handy. There are also some other

83
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:33,766
things to tell you, which is that, up here, you've got snapping tools. For instance, here this

84
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,766
is the position, even snap value. It's set to

85
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:41,766
10 at the moment, which is 10 units which in Unreal, by default, is 10

86
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:45,766
centimeters, so every time I move the chair it snaps to 10 centimeters. If I was to increase that to

87
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:49,766
100, it would jump up a meter. So, be aware of that snap value

88
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,766
for both the Position, the Rotation, but also the Scale. You can

89
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:57,766
have a Snap Value for Scale. Now, you can switch between these tools with W, E, and R keys,

90
00:05:57,766 --> 00:06:01,766
so it's worth keeping your left hand in that position. When you're scaling, you can scale on all

91
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:05,766
axis by dragging the middle cube, and then, you can scale on a

92
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,766
given axis, making a very strange looking chair, by using any of these

93
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:13,766
boxes there. OK, so it's pretty consistent and

94
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:17,766
simple to use actually. I quite like it! That's the way that you move things

95
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:21,766
around in the Editor. You have X, Y, and Z. X and Y are in the

96
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:25,766
ground planes, Z is up and down. You have a whole bunch of other options you should be

97
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:29,766
aware that are there. You can click here to see things like the frames per second and various other

98
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:33,766
things, that little down arrow at the top-left of the Viewport. You can choose Perspective or

99
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,766
Top, Bottom, Left, Right, etc. so you can get these kind of wireframe views.

100
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:41,766
At the top-right you have something that shows you a four way Viewport, which lets you see

101
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:45,766
simultaneously four different viewpoints. So, I'm seeing the chair and the rock from above

102
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:49,766
here, and then, I'm seeing from the left on one side and above in the front.

103
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:53,766
You see, pretty cool! And this can be really hand, when say, positioning things!

104
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:57,766
And then, you can get back out by just maximizing any of the viewports, say the 3D

105
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:01,766
Viewport. So, there's that, your snap options... You've got

106
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:05,766
here, notice the shortcuts Alt 2, 3, 4, etc. let

107
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,766
you change into like Wireframe and other views, that we'll be using a lot more through the course. Lighting

108
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:13,766
complexity, pretty cool stuff! You generally want to leave it in Lit, unless we have any particular reason

109
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,766
not to. And then, the Show menu lets you turn off various things, which are all

110
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:21,766
very complex and it's going to be fantastic fun unveiling how all this works!

111
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:25,766
But look, that's the essence of creating yourself a new level and putting some

112
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:29,766
of the basic things in it and moving around in it and focusing on things and moving them.

113
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:33,766
So, you have the very basics, so congratulations with that! It just remains to close

114
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:37,766
this, saving the map as we go.

115
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:41,766
I'm going to go and grab hold of the name of this video.

116
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:45,766
We'll just make it up as I go, so here we go! Uncommitted

117
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:49,766
changes, we have the map, it's what we've worked on, and the engine file. I'm going to stage

118
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:53,766
those like this. It's BE06 is the name of my

119
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:57,766
video or BuildingEscape_06.

120
00:07:57,766 --> 00:08:01,766
BE06 Getting to

121
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:05,766
Know Unreal's Editor. OK!

122
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:09,766
Don't worry about pushing things to the Internet, at the moment, unless you know what you're doing, and just commit that!

123
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:13,766
Great! So, we've not got a snapshot and if I wanted to,

124
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:17,766
I could go back to where we were before, but let's not do any of that, for now, because we haven't really

125
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:18,866
made much progress

126
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,366
Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.
