00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome to Everything

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.000
in its Place! So. in this video. we will be

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
noticing that Blueprint has superseded some of our code. We previously exposed

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
things like open door in the Details Tab; now. we want to get rid of that and

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
only set it in the curve. Because it's important. there's only one place per

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
parameter. and we'll be creating a second event called OnClose and use it to close the

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
door. By the time we're finished. we will have a situation where a couple of

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
things are different. Firstly. if we look at a door and we inspect it and we look at the

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
on door component. we will have 0 amounts of

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
open distance or time delays. Just a different

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Trigger Mass that we'll be able to set here. rather than it being hard coded. And when we play

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.200
the game. what's going to happen is the door is not only going to open smoothly. but when we come off the pressure pad. it's going to close smoothly.

13
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.200
So. with this blueprint we've got our door opening. The question is. how do we get it

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.200
closing? What we need is a Close or OnClose

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.200
event. coming into the Reverse pin. which will just run the animation backwards.

16
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.200
So. we want to be continuously. either firing OnOpenRequest

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.200
or on CloseRequest or make a slight naming change. as well.

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.200
So let's go over to the code and start preparing things.

19
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.200
OK. most of what we're going to do. over in the code. you can do.

20
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.200
and you'll do it in a challenge in just a moment. I just want to show you that the whole

21
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.200
spirit of this video is everything in it's place. You'll remember.

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.200
in the previous section. there was a video called a place for everything. Well. I have a lovely

23
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.200
saying. which is a place for everything and everything in it's place. [Laughs] And I just wanted to

24
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.200
jimmy that into the course some way. So. this

25
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.200
OpenAngle is now defined inside the blueprint. right.  so let's delete

26
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.200
it from the OpenDoor.h. We don't need an OpenAngle property. We shouldn't have an Open

27
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.200
Angle property. it's confusing to have it in two places.

28
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.200
We still need the PressurePlate. We don't need a DoorCloseDelay anymore.

29
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.200
You could orchestrate that inside the

30
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.200
blueprint rather. If you did want a CloseDeley. then you'd think

31
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.200
carefully about how and where you put it in. because it's very confusing to have the animation

32
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.200
or the curves determining one thing and then CloseDelay in here. So. I'm going to get rid

33
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.200
of CloseDelay. I'm also going to get rid of LastDoorOpenTime. The door

34
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.200
can immediately start closing the moment you step off the plate. now that it has

35
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.200
a nice smooth

36
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.200
movement. so we can get rid of all of those things

37
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.200
which is pretty cool. Now. this reminds me. by the way. that getting the total

38
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.200
mass in kilos... Do you remember that we had a task we left ourselves.

39
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.200
which was to make something into a parameter? It was the mass.

40
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.200
It's here. "// TODO make into a parameter". Let's just do that while we're here.

41
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.200
Total MassOfActorsOnPlate. rather than 30 it should be something

42
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.200
like TriggerMass OK.

43
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.200
So. I'm going to make a new EditAnywhere property

44
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.200
here. called TriggerMass Float

45
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.200
Mass =... And I'll give it a default value of.

46
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.200
not my previous lecture name. but 30 kilos.

47
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.200
OK. and then let's make it an EditAnywhere UPROPERTY. while we're messing around

48
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.200
with the interface here. Alright. that's cool!

49
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.200
Now. in our code. we are going to need to do a couple of things.

50
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.200
We no longer have LastDoorOpenTime. so let's get rid of that.

51
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.200
Well. we're calling ClosedDoor. but actually.

52
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.200
look if we look at this. what's the point of the whole OpenDoor() method? There's no point. is there?

53
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.200
It just called OnOpenRequest.Broadcast. so move

54
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.200
OnOpenRequest.Broadcase() down inside the TickComponent.

55
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.200
inside here. and just ditch the whole OpenDoor() method. We're just having a massive simplification

56
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.200
now. So. I'm also going to go over here and get rid of the

57
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.200
declaration of OpenDoor(). We don't need that. We're also.

58
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.200
of course. not going to need ClosedDoor(). because what we're going to do. in a moment.

59
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.200
or you're going to do is you're going to create a Closed

60
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.200
Request or OnClose event. and we're going to call it from here. So.

61
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.433
we won't need a ClosedDoor() method either. So. I've made a bunch of changes to

62
00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:10.200
the code there. while I was talking you through. They're pretty self explanatory. Let me just

63
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.200
compile to make sure I'm leaving you. before your challenge. with workable code. There's a good

64
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.200
chance in trying to do that and talking through it that I've made a mistake. so I'm going to

65
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.200
compile over here and let the Unreal Editor tell me.

66
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.200
Yep. so I've made a mistake there. on line 48 'LastDoor

67
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.200
Open Time' is undeclared. so I just need to be removing that.

68
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.200
And the point is that. we don't need to wait for a delay. What we're going to do

69
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.200
now is we're going to say. if the total mass of the Actors on the plate is greater than the

70
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.200
trigger mass. open the door. or else close the door.

71
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.200
And of course. there's a TODO which is we're going to get

72
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.200
rid of this method. but you're going to do that in a minute. Let's make sure that we now can compile.

73
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.200
Second compilation. should be a bit quicker if

74
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.200
it's just done one. There you go! I'm just going to play. make sure that the door opens.

75
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.200
So. it's all working! We've just had a refactor! Remember the red. green. refactor.

76
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.200
Things were working. they were green. We've refactored. they're still working. that's

77
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.200
good! Now. over to you! I want you to do the following challenge.

78
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.200
Create and connect OnClose. I want you to finish this off! So.

79
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.200
I suggest you rename the event class to FDoorEvent. It no longer makes sense for it to

80
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.200
be talking about OpenDoor(). when the event is both going to be responsible for a class

81
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.200
that's going to responsible for open and close events. So. don't be afraid to do a rename.

82
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.200
Rename the OnOpenRequest to simply OnOpen. You don't have

83
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.200
to but it's just easier to read. Create a new Blueprint

84
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.200
Assignable event. exactly like OnOpen. but call it on close.

85
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.200
Wire OnClose. over in the blueprint. to the "Reverse" pin.

86
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.200
and then. test that the door now opens. when you stand on the plate. and the moment

87
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.200
you step off it starts to close. So go ahead. pause the video. and see if you can get this finished

88
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.200
off yourself! By doing this. you'll really understand everything we've just done a lot better

89
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.200
than just listening to me rattle on and trying to keep up with me. OK. it's all about you

90
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.233
doing stuff. So. pause the video. spend your time on it. and come back with it's either done

91
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:06.200
or you've died trying.

92
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.200
Wicked welcome back! So let's do this

93
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.200
thing! Over in the header file then.

94
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.200
(FOnOpenRequest). Well. that no longer makes any sense. it's going to be

95
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.200
FDoorEvent. That is what I said isn't it? Yeah.

96
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.200
FDoorEvent. Cool. so that rename there should have done that! Now. let's go down to where we define

97
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.200
it! FDoorEvent OnOpenRequest; Well. I said we want to rename that. It was

98
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.200
just going to be OnOpen. I have to check my own instructions. I hate failing my own challenges.

99
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.200
Just bear with me a second. Yep. OnOpen! So. we now want to copy that

100
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.200
code and make a OnClose;

101
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.200
And yes. by the way. we're still polling this

102
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.200
PressurePlate every frame. over in out Tick. and that's not ideal but it's

103
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.200
fine for this section! I'm not even going to change it in this section. because there's enough going on

104
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.200
here with events. different types of blueprint events. etc. So. let's not

105
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.200
confuse things. but sure. you could do the whole thing event driven but we'll deal with that in a future

106
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.200
section. I'm going to get rid of this TODO. I'm going to change On

107
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.200
OpenRequest. Now really. I should have done a refactor on there. You see how I didn't refactor OnOpen

108
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.200
Request. I just changed its name. The problem with that. of course. is it doesn't change in all

109
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.200
cases. but there's only one here. I'm looking at the red in the margin. that's

110
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.200
gone. Now. we don't need to call CloseDoor() anymore. do we? We don't need to set this Actor

111
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.200
Rotation. so you can delete the method all together. Of course. you need to delete the

112
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.200
declaration. otherwise we'll get an error. We can then

113
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.200
do a OnClose.Broadcast();

114
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.200
I hope you remember that bit. That's a bit I didn't explicitly tell you in

115
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.200
the challenge. but of course. you need to broadcast the event. Hopefully you found that

116
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.200
by pattern matching against what we did before. so perfectly valid way of doing things.

117
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.200
OK. so the next stage is. I think that I finished doing my code. I want

118
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.200
to compile the code. make sure that works. You need to compile the code for

119
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.200
the new event to even be visible inside Blueprint. Unless you've compiled. it's

120
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.200
not even going to be there. So. the compile has worked! Now. let's go into

121
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.200
Blueprint! Now. do you remember how you get hold of... Why can't

122
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.200
I find OnCloseRequest.OnClose or whatever? And also.

123
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.200
what's going to happen to the fact that this has been renamed? Well. let's try compile. see if the rename

124
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.200
comes through! It hasn't come through. interestingly.

125
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.200
Let's check our code. OnOpen. So firstly.

126
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.200
we're going to fix both of these things together. I want to make sure that the thing with the new name is

127
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.200
in here. even if this works. I don't want it working by happenstance. So. I'm

128
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.200
going to go to Window again. Components which will bring up this menu. Remember

129
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.200
that once you're click on OpenDoor. you can now find your

130
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.200
events. Event dispatchers you see on open. The same again. right-

131
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.200
click on the OpenDoor in the Components. Add Event.

132
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.200
Event Dispatchers. OnClose. OK. so we've

133
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.200
got the OnClose. Oh. I did OnClose twice. didn't I! Let's get rid of this OnOpen

134
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.200
Request. This OnOpenRequest. It's just not updated the name. so I want to

135
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200
delete it and make sure that we do actually update the

136
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.200
name. And you see another way to get to it. by the way. is just to right-click

137
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.200
OnOpen and say AddEventOnOpen. So. there's another option. That was over there

138
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.200
in the Components menu. right there. Pretty cool hey! So look. we're nearly there!

139
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.200
We just need to get to where you can see what I'm doing. We

140
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.200
need to say that. OnOpen. we go into Play and OnClose we go into

141
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.200
Reverse. Now. let's watch this in action! Drag it to the right!

142
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.200
We don't. as I say. have to compile your blueprint. It's not necessary to do it every time.

143
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.200
because when we go over to the game and play. look what happens! I go on.

144
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.200
the doors. you see the doors opening. because the OnOpen event is firing. firing. firing. firing? But when

145
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200
I come off the pressure plate. the OnClose event fire. fire. fire. fire. and the whole thing

146
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.200
reverses. Pretty cool hey! Pretty

147
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.200
cool. apart from the fact I can now probably get out of this room. if I really run for the door.

148
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.200
but we won't worry about that. right now. that's just play-tuning.

149
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.200
That has achieved the goal of teaching you how to finish

150
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.200
off this type of blueprint. And you can see that you can do blueprint. right next to your

151
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.200
code. We're doing as little as possible really. in the blueprint.

152
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.200
There is a Timeline track. called a Vector

153
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.200
Track. but we don't need... A vector won't work

154
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.200
for a rotator. so you have to convert from vector to rotator anyway. so I used a

155
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.200
Float Track just because I'm trying to say. I only really want to be changing one axis

156
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.200
of a door. right. But if this was something else. and we were changing its position. we

157
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.200
may want to make it a Vector Track and then put it straight into Set Actor position

158
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.200
or something. But the reason I've used a float here is. as I say. for simplicity. But it's

159
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.200
pretty simple isn't it? Pretty simple and clean! OK. the whole

160
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.200
project is looking pretty good now. The only remaining thing is a bit meanging.

161
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.200
as I would say. is that we are polling the trigger volume

162
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.200
every frame. rather than responding to events. but I'm going to live with that for now because it's

163
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.200
not causing us a performance issue. So. we're pretty much

164
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.200
done with this section! Of course. my room is very rudimentary! What I really want you guys

165
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.200
to do is go and do a lot more exciting things. multiple rooms. use these

166
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.200
mechanics in lost of different ways. and maybe even create your own new mechanic.

167
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.200
But for now. we are doing really nicely. I'm just going to look at it in full screen.

168
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.200
because occasionally it's nice to see your thing in all its glory.

169
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.200
And over there. and then to watch it close. and remember. you can

170
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.200
control the speed. you can control the curve. and much more like it!

171
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.566
So. see you soon!
