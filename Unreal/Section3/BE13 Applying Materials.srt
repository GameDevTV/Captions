00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. welcome to Applying

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Materials. In this video. we're going to explain that a material is comprised

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of one or more textures and one or more shaders.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Textures are image files. Shaders are GPU code. running on your

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
graphics processing unit. your graphics card. So. Unreal ships with some impressive

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
examples of materials. Unreal has powerful material editing

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
tools in it. which we'll take a look at and play with. and it'll be applying materials to our room

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
interior. By the end of it. you will have created something like this. a chair

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so hideous looking that you will be desperate to escape the room. You'll have

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
nicely materialed floors and walls. and you'll be able to actually change the

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
colors of things like the metal and seats on this chair. so see you there!

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.733


13
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:48.733
So guys. it's time to make this thing a lot more pretty. Let's

14
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:52.733
start with the floor. This checkerboard is all very nice with it's. what are they. 5 centimeter squares

15
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:56.733
inside? What are they? 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. so

16
00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.733
by 50 centimeter squares. but it's kind of boring right? So

17
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:04.733
why don't we get some materials. Where do we find them? Guess what. in the Starter

18
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:08.733
Pack! Go to Materials and then here they are! Now.

19
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:12.733
let's have a look! We can preview them here. if you want more detail you can double-click on them.

20
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.733
And then what are you going to get? You're going to get a face full of this thing.

21
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:20.733
which is basically a Node Editor. It's very similar to the Blueprint Editor. it's basically

22
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:24.733
built from the same stuff. and it's a little bit scary. particularly this one.

23
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.733
Materials are complicated. they combine together images which can

24
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.733
and have a lot of different purposes. This guy here is something called a Normal Map.

25
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.733
which gives the illusion of surface detail that's not there. of geometry

26
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:40.733
that's not there. roughness that's not there. and you've got all sorts of things. You have

27
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.733
masks that can mask out things like part of something that emits light

28
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:48.733
and part that doesn't. emissive masks. You can have all sorts of different things. complicated

29
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:52.733
bit of kit. but for now. we're going to focus on just applying them and

30
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:56.733
tweaking them slightly. So. how do we apply them? Well. let's find something that's going to work.

31
00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:00.733
like a Wood_Floor_Walnut. Just grab it. drag it. drop it on

32
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:04.733
the floor. Oh look at that! If you get close

33
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:08.733
to that floor. look how pretty that is. that's just ridiculous!

34
00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:12.733
I mean. bearing in mind this is running at how many frames a second? I don't know.

35
00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:16.733
Click at the top-left of the Perspective Viewport. click Show

36
00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:20.733
FPS. and OK I'm running a GTX 980 here and a 4

37
00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:24.733
Gigahertz processor thingy but it's doing 120 frames per second.

38
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:28.733
which is plenty even for VR. so very very pretty OK!

39
00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:32.733
It's cool! You can adjust various properties of these

40
00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:36.733
materials. I don't think we need to go into a huge amount of detail about that right now. but I want to show you

41
00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:40.733
where you get to the details of the materials. And where do you think it is? It's under the Details

42
00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:44.733
Tab! So we click on Details. we scroll down. and we can see materials here.

43
00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:48.733
and that tells you what material is assigned. If you have something with a material and you

44
00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:52.733
want to see where that is in your Content Browser. you click the little magnifying glass. so

45
00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:56.733
we're in the Details Tag against Materials. Clicking the magnifying glass takes you back to the material

46
00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:00.733
itself. OK. so that's fine! You

47
00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:04.733
can right-click on the material to see various different things. The main thing you're going to want to do

48
00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:08.733
there is to say Edit or just double-click. You could also go

49
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:12.733
to Asset Actions and Select Assets Using This Asset. which is kind of a way of going back

50
00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:16.733
the other way. That's selected the floor. We've got the floor selected.

51
00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:20.733
we can go to Details. and we can go back to the material. So. that's how you can kind of get back and forth between

52
00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.733
those. The rest of these properties here aren't really too specificly

53
00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:28.733
related to the material. but there is a sneaky thing going on here. If you look at Static

54
00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:32.733
Mesh under the details. you can actually drag that down and

55
00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:36.733
there's other stuff there. and sometimes you'll see other property panels

56
00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:40.733
here that have the ability to drag down or click down and show more

57
00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:44.733
information. So. just watch out for that. when you're exploring to see what's available. Obviously

58
00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:48.733
we will show you things as they're necessary. Rendering here. there's some more information about rendering

59
00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:52.733
and to do with all sorts of stuff that we don't need to get into right now.

60
00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:56.733
OK. because we can't boil the ocean by teaching everything at once.   So.

61
00:03:56.733 --> 00:04:00.733
that's how you apply a material to the floor! How do we apply materials to the wall? Let's go and find a

62
00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:04.733
reasonable wall material. I think we're going to end up with a really boring basic wall

63
00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:08.733
material. One way is to just grab that and drag it and drop it on the wall panel

64
00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:12.733
OK. but they already have that basic wall material on them. So. if we want to make

65
00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:16.733
it a little bit different. we could maybe use a brick. So. one wall panel at a time. we can go

66
00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:20.733
around dragging the material we want onto it. So for instance. this may be a brick

67
00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:24.733
wall down at this end here. and then. we may want to have. I don't know.

68
00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:28.733
concrete grime. That's a bit weird but I suppose. if we're going to be trapped in a room

69
00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:32.733
then that's maybe what we want on these wall panels.

70
00:04:32.733 --> 00:04:36.733
So. I'm just going to apply materials to the rest of the walls here.

71
00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:40.733
fairly painstakingly. When you're doing BSP. there is actually a way of selecting adjacent

72
00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:44.733
walls. but we're not doing BSP editing. So. look how much better that's looking already!

73
00:04:44.733 --> 00:04:48.733
OK. so now what I want to show you. before I briefly leave you to

74
00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:52.733
go and customize your materials. is a little bit of customization. Let's take this chair

75
00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:56.733
and say I don't like that yellow there! That's horrible! I'm just going to show you how.

76
00:04:56.733 --> 00:05:00.733
in the Material Node Editor. we could actually change that yellow. So. go

77
00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:04.733
to the chair. go to the Details Tab.

78
00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:08.733
click to browse over to the actual

79
00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:12.733
material. so not here under Static Mesh but the one below under

80
00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:16.733
Materials. That'll take you to here M_Chair. which doesn't look much

81
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:20.733
like the chair. Now. you can zoom out with the Mouse Wheel. we can get rid of the

82
00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:24.733
Palette. and there is the general pattern of the chair. Now this thing here. this sphere.

83
00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:28.733
is actually the chair. but it's mapped onto a sphere

84
00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:32.733
right now. so this is probably the baseplate of the chair or the back. You can map it onto

85
00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:36.733
a chair model. but in order to do that. as it says: "You need to select a

86
00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:40.733
mesh-based asset" first. So. let's just not bother right now. it's easy enough to do.

87
00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:44.733
but let's keep things simple. What I want to show you is how you could change

88
00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:48.733
this yellow color. So. it's actually quite well laid out. You've got a Color

89
00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:52.733
Seats parameter here. which leads into some Lerp. which is a Linear Interpolation.

90
00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:56.733
which leads into another one. which multiplies with something to do with

91
00:05:56.733 --> 00:06:00.733
metal coloring. and eventually changes the base coloring of the chair. So.

92
00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:04.733
this is not the time to get into the full details of how material node editing works.

93
00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:08.733
but what I want to show you is the lever you need to pull. And you need to go and find your color

94
00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:12.733
seats. for example. and you can change that to maybe a blue

95
00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:16.733
color. with this picker here. Click OK

96
00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:20.733
so that's then changed. and then we just need to save at the top-left

97
00:06:20.733 --> 00:06:24.733
and then close the whole Node Editor. And look

98
00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:28.733
what's happened to my chair! It's actually quite a disgusting blue. I find now!

99
00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:32.733
Maybe you like it. So. I'm going to go and edit that once again. just to reinforce

100
00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:36.733
it. and then. I want you to go and play but at least change the seat color. You're welcome to

101
00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:40.733
play with other properties of the metal. etc. as well. So. let's take another look at

102
00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:44.733
that M_Chair material. which is in Content.

103
00:06:44.733 --> 00:06:48.733
StarterContent. Props. Materials.

104
00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:52.733
We go into it. we have a look around. you zoom with the Mouse Wheel. you drag with the Right Mouse Button.

105
00:06:52.733 --> 00:06:56.733
This thing here is a complicated

106
00:06:56.733 --> 00:07:00.733
map. which is actually a mask which is telling the system what

107
00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:04.733
is metal and what is reflective and what's not. etc. But we want to look around for

108
00:07:04.733 --> 00:07:08.733
the color of the metal and the color of the seats. Let's just focus on those two.

109
00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:12.733
Customize them to your needs. So. I'm going to go for... I don't know what color seat I want. Bright

110
00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:16.733
red. Ferrari Red seat! OK! Wait. make sure it goes

111
00:07:16.733 --> 00:07:20.733
red! Don't really like that. it's not quite Ferrari red enough for me.

112
00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:24.733
That's a bit better. It's not quite coming out right.

113
00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:28.733
Hmm. anyway it's close enough! And then. the color of the metal.

114
00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:32.733
Well. maybe I'm going to make the metal a little more goldie. That's going to be a bit bling isn't it? So.

115
00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:36.733
then I save the material there. It's now saving the asset.

116
00:07:36.733 --> 00:07:40.733
Close. look at the chair. and now it's got... That's actually worse!

117
00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:44.733
[Laughs] But so what. it's comic! So. what I want you to do now is to go

118
00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:48.733
ahead and customize your materials. Apply materials. as you see fit.

119
00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:52.733
from the Starter Pack. play with their properties to see the effect that is has. and then. share

120
00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:56.733
your creations in the discussions. See how disgusting you can make that chair!

121
00:07:56.733 --> 00:08:00.733
For example. how foul a combination of colors can you create or how cohesive and

122
00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:04.733
exciting a combination of colors you can create. Either way. either astound us with your artistic

123
00:08:04.733 --> 00:08:08.733
abilities or sicken us with your incoherence.

124
00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:12.733
OK guys. welcome back! So there's

125
00:08:12.733 --> 00:08:16.733
not really much for me to do here. I've already created a fairly sickening looking chair.

126
00:08:16.733 --> 00:08:20.733
and I've already applied materials to everything. I'm leaving the roof open just for lighting. at the moment. So.

127
00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:24.733
I would just simply take a screenshot of this. share it in the discussions. I'm going to turn off this

128
00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:28.733
frames per second indicator. because it's kind of irritating me. So. that's at the top-left there.

129
00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:32.733
And I will see you shortly. when we will carry on building this. Building Escape!

130
00:08:32.733 --> 00:08:36.733
With that chair there. you're going to want to escape this building now. so that's the incentive to leave!

131
00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:38.733
