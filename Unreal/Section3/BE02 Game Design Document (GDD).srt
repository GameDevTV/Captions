00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000


2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So. as usual. before we dive and start playing with Unreal. we need to have some

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
concept of what we're going to be doing. So. this again is our Game Design Document

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and our friendly starting point for all game development projects. By the way.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
on these slides at the bottom right. I'm going to be annotating with the version of Unreal

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that the tutorial was recorded in. So. you're seeing it's in v.4.10.2.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That'll just help you be orientated if watching this. once a later

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
version is out. It always gives you the option to go back.  Anyway. this is about game design.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so let's just take a look firstly at the concept. What are we building here?

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The core concept is really simple: escape the room!

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You awaken in a locked room. unable to escape; use environmental

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
clues. such as light and sound. to determine what to do next. So. we're going to design

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
some nice simple ways of trying to guide the player. as to what they

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
may need to be doing next. It's going to be a very small scope game. because there's a

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
lot of new stuff. when we get into Unreal. We're going to do things like

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
trigger pressure plates and solve at least the bull cow puzzle. to progress towards

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the exit. So that's the idea! Rules. well there's no lose

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
condition. apart from the feeling that you're going to die in this room if you don't get out eventually.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Anything that you can do you're allowed to do. so there's no

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
kind of restrictions on what you're allowed to do. if you can do it. do it.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and you win by finally exiting the room!

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Requirements! So. what does this thing need to make it happen? Well. we're going to use

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Unreal's provided Starter Content pack. That's got plenty of wall

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
sections and a table and a chair and some lights and doors and

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
door frames. all the stuff we really need. If you've got assets that you've either

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
bought or made and you want to bring those in. absolutely do that. but I'm just going to start with the

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Starter Content. so we're all on the same page. We're going to need to write some C++

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
code and some Blueprint to encode the behavior. We're going to use C++ where it

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
makes the most sense and Blueprint where that makes the most sense. We're going to

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
use various sound effects to enhance the atmosphere. If we can't find stuff in the Start

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Content pack. then I will provide you with sounds from a sound

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
library that's been kindly donated to us. which we'll hear about later on.

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And you're going to need some sketches for the layout

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of your room or rooms. It's up to you. really. whether you build one room or multiple

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
rooms. I would either build one big one or lots of little ones interconnected.

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I also encourage you go build a different layout to what I do in this section.

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And you're going to need sketches or at least one sketch.

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
for how one puzzle works. Maybe don't sketch them all out yet. because

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
you'd be better off doing one. encoding one. making it work. and then

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
design the rest. maybe after that. when you've got a little bit more experience about what would

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
be involved. before you go and get super excited and start trying to recreate the next

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
version of The Witness or Myst or whatever else you love. There's a lot of programming

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
involved in those things and we're not quite ready for that yet. So that's it!

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
That's the concept rules and requirements. and we'll see how it pans out. What I want

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
you to do now is sketch your room or rooms. Sketch out one large room

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
or a few smaller ones. Annotate where the puzzles will be or at least your

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
first guess. You can change any of this later. you can change your mind later.

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Create a more detailed sketch of one of the puzzles. just one.

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
As I said. we want to make sure that we

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
understand what's involved in actually implementing these things. before we get carried away with some massive

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
design that we may not be ready as a team  for. whether that's a team of 1. 2. 3. or

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
300! We want to make sure we're capable of delivering what we're

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
dreaming about. so let's deliver things as we think about them. This is very lean to just

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
make one puzzle. get it completely finished. and then start thinking about the

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
rest. We're kind of prototyping and testing all in one. And I want you to

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
just share your sketches in the discussions. with the other students.

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
By the way. Evernote can be a great tool for storying these things. Once you've

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
taken your sketches. then certainly on iOS and

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Android. you can take a photo of your sketches. using Evernote on the smartphone.

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and then. you can store it in Evernote and actually get a link

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to the hosted version of the Evernote. That's one way of storing these things.

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The good thing about Evernote is. it will recognize your handwriting if it's reasonably neat

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and really help you find things later. So. just a thought. you could use Evernote or you could use

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
anything else. So. that's it really! I want you to pause the video. In fact. stop the video.

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
go ahead and do your design now. and I'm going to pull out my sketches and

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
designed. as we go through the section as needed. so it will be a surprise for you!

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And in the next video. we'll start setting up our project and looking at Unreal's files

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.266
and the file structure and version control and lots of fun stuff like that! I will see you soon!

69
00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:35.766
Vroom! Video end!
