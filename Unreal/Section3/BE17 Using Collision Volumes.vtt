1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.166
So welcome

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.000
to Using Collision Volumes! In this video, I'm going to explain the Collision Volumes,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
also known as Colliders. You may hear me use both terms.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
These tell the Physics Engine what hits what, what collides with

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
what. A trigger volume, in contrast, just triggers code,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and a collider actually has physics simulated on it, so it's a bit more

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
computationally heavy. And we'll be exploring how to add collision volumes to things,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
basically to prevent players from passing through that door.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, by the end of it, we will have a room that you actually can't

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
escape, I'll have a glass ceiling in, and if the doors are closed, then

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.233
we cannot actually pass through them bang, so we are stuck properly! OK cool, see you soon!

12
00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:50.233
So, let's take a look at this. Of course, we can pass, not through

13
00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:54.233
the walls, we'll talk about that in a future video, but look we can pass straight through

14
00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:58.233
the door. And let me show you how we fix that and use this video as an example

15
00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:02.233
of talking about collision volumes. Collisions are relatively complex

16
00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:06.233
in Unreal, there's lots of stuff going on. If we click say on the door

17
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.233
and we start looking in the Details Panel, down on the left-hand side here, you'll

18
00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:14.233
see you've got several sections. Transform we've talked about, is there's the mesh,

19
00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:18.233
which we'll be using. There's the Materials which have got nothing to do with collisions. I'll collapses that!

20
00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:22.233
There's the physics, which it is the Physics Engine dealing with materials,

21
00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:26.233
but generally the collision has been separated out into a separate thing here,

22
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:30.233
and it's saying it's got a Collision Preset, which is BlockAllDynamic

23
00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:34.233
objects. Even if we set this, however, to block all

24
00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:38.233
Actors or even Pawns, you'll find that we still will pass through the door.

25
00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:42.233
Let's have a look! You see we still pass through the door. OK,

26
00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:46.233
so it doesn't really matter what we set this to, we're still going to end up passing through the door. So what we need to do,

27
00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:50.233
in this instance, to stop ourselves from passing through the door is put a collision volume on

28
00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:54.233
the door. Let me show you how to do that and talk you through the Collision Volume System.

29
00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:58.233
So, right-click on the door and say Edit SM_Door. So that's editing the door mesh.

30
00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:02.233
I'm going to maximize the ensuing window, not worry about the stuff on the right,

31
00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:06.233
and again, remember your Meyer Controls here. You can hit F to

32
00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:10.233
focus on this door, and then, you can hold the Alt Key, whilst

33
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:14.233
holding down the Left Mouse Button. So, I'm holding down Alt, which, of course, on a Mac

34
00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:18.233
is also Alt and then holding down the Left-Mouse Button, which is a pretty

35
00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:22.233
cool way of going around this thing. Now, if you toggle Collision at the top of your screen here, you'll see

36
00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:26.233
that there is no green stuff going on, on this door. There is no collision

37
00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:30.233
volume. So let's add one! There's lot of ways, it's got a pretty powerful system. You could add a sphere

38
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:34.233
and that's of course not what we want. We don't want the system to think that we're colliding that

39
00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:38.233
door when we're this far away. So, sphere is not what we're after.

40
00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:42.233
We can Delete Selected Collision or

41
00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:46.233
Remove Collision, either way. So a capsule, what's a capsule? Well, it

42
00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:50.233
looks like that! That's pretty cool for the players and characters. Players often have this kind of round feature

43
00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:54.233
at the bottom, because it's quite good for going over slopes and bumps. OK,

44
00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:58.233
so that's that, but we don't want that one either. Of course, what we're going to use for a door is just a

45
00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:02.233
simple box collision. And the size of it, is it reasonable? Well, it's

46
00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:06.233
sticking out a little bit far because of the handle, but as a first approximation

47
00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:10.233
that's absolutely fine. There are other tools, pretty good

48
00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:14.233
tools here in Unreal. If I just show you them, they let you do things like

49
00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:18.233
this. You can go Add 10DOP-X Simplified

50
00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:22.233
Collision. So, that's not going to do much in this case, because in the X axis the

51
00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:26.233
thing is pretty semetric right, but you could look at how the different things work. If we do it in

52
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:30.233
Y, you see that it's trying to match in the Y axis a little,

53
00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:34.233
and then Z again tries to match but it's offsetting and not working very well.

54
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:38.233
So, it's a pretty good system this! There's all sorts of stuff you can do in terms of

55
00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:42.233
creating collision volumes that aren't too complicated. Collision volumes for performance,

56
00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:46.233
it's very important that they are not too many polygons.

57
00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:50.233
So, if you ever run out of capability

58
00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:54.233
here with Unreal's Collision System, then

59
00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:58.233
you can always create a customized mesh outside of Unreal, whether you created

60
00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:02.233
your mesh in Blender or Maya in 3D Studio, and then, you can import that

61
00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:06.233
collision as a separate issue. But we're not going to deal with that today. All

62
00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:10.233
we're going to simply do is Add Box Simplified Collision

63
00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:14.233
to the door, and it literally puts a cuboid on the door and says that

64
00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:18.233
this is from a physics collision point of view, where I've considered the

65
00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:22.233
door to start and finish. OK, and the benefit of this

66
00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:26.233
is if we were to use the actual mesh, with all it's polygons,

67
00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.233
I mean think about the handle of this door, there's a lot of polygons on there. It would just slow the system

68
00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:34.233
down to a halt. It's quite costly as things move around at, you know,100

69
00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:38.233
frames a second, like in our case, to actually be working out whether things are overlapping and

70
00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:42.233
colliding and then to simulate the physics. Because remember that these collision volumes

71
00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:46.233
are a step further than their trigger. They look like a trigger, but they are a step

72
00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:50.233
further because they actually get physics simulated. So,

73
00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:54.233
it's important they're simple. That's really what I want to rub home here. Click save and you

74
00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:58.233
can close this window. Now, that's of course edited, the

75
00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:02.233
actual door mesh. So, both of these doors are based on that, so what I would hope

76
00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:06.233
to find now is that we can't go through either door, and we are finally

77
00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:10.233
properly trapped inside our room, whereas previous we could get out.

78
00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:14.233
Alright, so I have a little challenge for you. I just want to ensure you can't escape

79
00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:18.233
your room, as you have it so far. Make sure there are no gaps in your colliders, if you need to add them

80
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:22.233
to anything. Test you can't escape over the walls or any other way,

81
00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:26.233
and if you need to, go in and customize your collision volumes. Just mess around with those settings,

82
00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:30.233
and as Einstein says, make things as simple as possible

83
00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:34.233
but no simpler. So go ahead, pause the video, and make sure your room is truly

84
00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:38.233
inescapable!

85
00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:42.233
OK welcome back! So, I'm just going to test my room, a bit of play-testing. By the way, here's a hint here!

86
00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:46.233
When you play, you can hit the F11 Key, F11,

87
00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:50.233
and that will maximize the Play Window. And if you're fed up

88
00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:54.233
with seeing "LIGHTING NEEDS TO BE REBUILT", you can restore,

89
00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:58.233
go ahead pick a lighting quality. Maybe we'll go for

90
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:02.233
medium to save some time. At least take it off of preview. You see if lighting quality is

91
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:06.233
set to Preview, then you get these horrible preview things all over your textures.

92
00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:10.233
And then, say Build Lighting Only. It doesn't take too long. Well, it doesn't on my machine. This is a 4

93
00:06:10.233 --> 00:06:14.233
gig i7. It's

94
00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:18.233
doing it though, it's still building. "Build lighting completed", Apply Now, Good!

95
00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:22.233
I'm just going to stop and play again.

96
00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:26.233
Basically, you're better off letting the lighting build finish before you actually

97
00:06:26.233 --> 00:06:30.233
go into the game. Now, you will notice that those preview things have gone off, the lighting looks a little bit nicer,

98
00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:34.233
and the way to test this, by the way, the best way to test it really is to like give it to a 3 year old.

99
00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:38.233
Is to just move around. Now of course, you can get

100
00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:42.233
out of this room, in my case, because I can get out the top of the room, so I really need to put

101
00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:46.233
a roof on here, or to make this Pawn, not a

102
00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:50.233
Pawn, into like a character controller. So, I guess it depends

103
00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:54.233
on our strategy for this. Do we want to be a person flying around, or do we want to be like a

104
00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:58.233
drone flying around? At the moment, we're a drone, and of course, I can go out the

105
00:06:58.233 --> 00:07:02.233
doors because we haven't got a timer on them. So, it's entirely up to you,

106
00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:06.233
whether you want to try and constrain your guy to the ground or let it fly around, but if you

107
00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:10.233
stick with the pawn, which is nice and simple, it's naturally going to be able to fly. And so the

108
00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:14.233
most natural way, in an indoor environment to prevent it from getting out, is actually just to

109
00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:18.233
put some ceiling panels on it. So, we'd go to the Content Browser,

110
00:07:18.233 --> 00:07:22.233
and we'll have a look around and see if we can find something in Architecture.

111
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:26.233
Like it's likely to end up being a wall panel that we use for the ceiling,

112
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:30.233
or maybe we can find some glass or something like that. That would be pretty cool, a glass ceiling!

113
00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:34.233
Here you go! So, let's try this glass window, bring it into the scene

114
00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:38.233
here, and then, it's going to rotate it until it's

115
00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:42.233
flat. And then, I'm going to use

116
00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:46.233
the Translation, holding down Shift, so I can bring it up till it looks like it

117
00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:50.233
is level with the roof. And actually, this would be a really great example of using the quad views.

118
00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:54.233
So, I'm going to go into the top-right of the Viewport, into this kind of quad view here,

119
00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:58.233
minimize things that I don't need,

120
00:07:58.233 --> 00:08:02.233
and then, I'm going to get myself scrolled around with the Right Mouse Button, so that I

121
00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:06.233
can see exactly where I'm going. So that looks like it's in line with the roof. Then, I need

122
00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:10.233
to come to a Top View to get it... It's tricky

123
00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:14.233
to grab hold of. I need to go back and select in 3D View. Here we go!

124
00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:18.233
There you go! Select in the right place. Now, you can use the Scale Tool to

125
00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:22.233
actually scale this thing so that it's at least as big as

126
00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:26.233
it needs to be, in order to cover the roof. You get the idea, this is pretty simple. So, I'm just

127
00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:30.233
going to quickly move this thing around. Right Mouse Button to drag it around,

128
00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:34.233
Left Mouse Button to drag the transform, R Key to go into Scale

129
00:08:34.233 --> 00:08:38.233
Mode, and you can also set the parameters in the Details Tab. That's

130
00:08:38.233 --> 00:08:42.233
fine as well. And then, we need to scale in the other direction,

131
00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:46.233
quite a long way. Zoom out... Oh that's a bit too far!

132
00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:50.233
It doesn't matter if it's too big, it just needs to fit right over the top here right?

133
00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:54.233
So now, we have a glass ceiling, literally! Let's have a look and see what happens!

134
00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:58.233
Uh, I can't get out of the roof! That's fine! It's a little bit strange,

135
00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:02.233
diffraction effects with the glass there, but I'm going to live with that for now. I've achieved my goal of

136
00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:08.766
not being able to get out of the room, apart from the fact that these doors don't close on a timer, which we'll deal wth shortly!
