Hey and welcome to section 3! I am really

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
excited that we're about to actually dive into the Unreal Editor and

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
start slowly uncovering all of the power! Now. I do warn you. some of the things. when

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we get in there. are going to be a little bit scary. especially when it comes to the C++

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
code that Unreal will be generating for us. But don't worry. we will dive in step by

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
step and start to understand it. This section is going to be focused on escaping

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a building. so we're going to be building interiors. things on a several

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
meter scale. We're going to be using trigger volumes and environmental

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
cues. to give yourself a static mesh

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
based puzzle experience. So by static mesh I mean. we're not using animations

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or skeletal meshes. We'll keep it simple for now. And we're going to be just trying to get

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
out of the building. and I'm going to leave you lots of scope to make the building how

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you like. And we're going to be focusing. really. on how the C++

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
classes are going to talk to Blueprint. where appropriate. and how we're going to trigger the sort of

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
behaviors we want to trigger. Now. we will be using both C++ and

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Blueprint. The reason for that is just that some things are better done in Blueprint. like

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the way that a door opens. defining the curve with which that

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
motion happens. much better done in Blueprint. Sometimes it's easier to reference things

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in your scene using Blueprint. and sometimes it's easier to wire

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
assets through Blueprint. than trying to wire assets directly into

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
C++. because then things can be changed and manipulated much more easily.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But this is a C++ Unreal course. so fundamentally we're going to be making sure that

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
C++ is always there with us. that we base all our Blueprint classes on

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
C++ classes. or at least have the ability to reparent them later. which will

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
make sense when we get there. So this is going to lay the foundations for

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
using the editor for you. really getting comfortable with the Unreal Editor.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
for understanding how C++ code can be accessed in

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Blueprint. For instance an event. our lock code may unlock a door and that

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
event may appear in a blueprint and also how we can call into C++ code

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
from a Blueprint Flowchart. So it's going to be exciting. I look forward to working

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
with you on it! Come with me. have your say. get involved. and let's go and

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.866
learn Unreal!
