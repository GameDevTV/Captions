00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to Grabbing System Overviews!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So. in this video we're going to do a quick look at the end result of the

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
next few videos. because it's going to be a mini series about how to create a

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
grabbing system. so we can actually pick up the chair and put it on a pressure plate. A very useful

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
general tool. right. in a a game. to be able to pick something up and move it.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So. you can try and think about how it may be done. as a part of this video.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and I'll be outlining how we'll be doing it. So. you can think about it. work out what

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you're questions and concerns are. and then. I will show you my solution and

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
outline the end result. So. we won't actually be doing any changing or any coding. we'll just be

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
getting a mental model of how it all fits together. So. let's dive in and do

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that and just watch this video. Nothing to actually do in Unreal. until the next video.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.566


13
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:48.566
So. let's take a look at roughly how this may end up! We're going to play the game!

14
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:52.566
The idea is that. as we move around we're constantly sending

15
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:56.566
out a beam that decides what we're going to collide with. When we get close enough to the chair. we suddenly grab

16
00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:00.566
hold of it and that means that we can then move and manipulate it around the scene.

17
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:04.566
OK. so how may this work? Well.

18
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:08.566
the first thing I want you to do is. just write down your ideas. using your knowledge to date. as to how

19
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:12.566
it might work. Use the knowledge you have already. Would you use a

20
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:16.566
component to do this. or would you use inheritance?

21
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:20.566
Hint: either could work. I just want to hear you reasoning to yourself at this

22
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:24.566
stage. so do it in the discussions with the other students.

23
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:28.566
How might you know what to grab? How

24
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:32.566
might you ask the game what to grab? You see. you don't know the answers to these questions. but what I

25
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:36.566
want to know is what your questions are. It would be interesting to see what you're thinking

26
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:40.566
at this stage and what open questions you have and what ideas you have. And what game

27
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.566
object would you be working with? So. we want to know. you know. what game object are we going

28
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.566
to be working with? Are we going to make a specialization of it? Is it. is a

29
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:52.566
or is it a has a? Do we put a component on? And then. perhaps maybe how it's going to

30
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:56.566
work. So. I just want you to get in the habit of thinking about a chunk of work like this. like a grabbing

31
00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:00.566
system. That's going to take several lectures worth of teaching to get it out.

32
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:04.566
And think about what the issues could be and be brave enough just to share them. You

33
00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:08.566
don't have to have all the answers. Some of you will have great answers. some of you will just be full of questions.

34
00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:12.566
but that's part of the process. so have a go!

35
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:16.566
Welcome back! So. let's take an overview of how I

36
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:20.566
plan to do the grabbing system. We want to be able to life the chair next. as I said. So.

37
00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:24.566
we'll add a Grabber.cpp component to the player. Now. remember that the

38
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:28.566
player. in this case. is a default pawn. and it's a Default Pawn that we don't

39
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:32.566
have access to until the game runs. which will introduce some interesting

40
00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:36.566
challenges. So. the player is a temporary actor and

41
00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:40.566
it appears on play. The player is a Default Pawn. a pawn is an actor.

42
00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:44.566
so the player. the temporary actor. the Default Pawn. they're all the same thing. and they

43
00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:48.566
don't appear until the game starts playing. It's the Game Mode. which sets

44
00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:52.566
which Default Pawn to use. so

45
00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:56.566
we need to be making a modification to the Game Mode. So. we're going to create a Default

46
00:02:56.566 --> 00:03:00.566
Pawn and a Game Mode Blueprint. We're going to do both of those in Blueprint. because it's just

47
00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:04.566
easier. and you'll see why later on. It avoids something called hard coding of

48
00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:08.566
assets. What that means is. we don't end up typing the exact name of

49
00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:12.566
our modified Default Pawn into code. because

50
00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:16.566
if we do that and we change the name in the editor. then it won't be tracked.

51
00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:20.566
So. we'll see why Blueprint is very useful for binding assets to our code.

52
00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:24.566
And once we have changed the Game Mode

53
00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:28.566
and made ourselves a new Default Pawn. we will specify

54
00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:32.566
our modified Default Pawn to the Game Mode. So. all sounds a bit

55
00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:36.566
confusing doesn't it? Let's work from the top and just think about it once more. Let me show you

56
00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:40.566
it in action. Bear in mind. your project won't look like this right now. because I have it setup.

57
00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:44.566
This is the end result of the next few lectures. alright. So. what I'm saying is that under

58
00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:48.566
Project Settings and Maps and Mode. what

59
00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:52.566
we're going to end up with is a different Game Mode. We're going to make a Blueprinted version of our Game Mode.

60
00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:56.566
Previously we had this set. and that doesn't let you choose the Default Pawn

61
00:03:56.566 --> 00:04:00.566
class here. in the Editor. You could do it in code. but we want to be able to do it in the editor. So. we

62
00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:04.566
change to a Blueprint version. after having made it. We will then make a

63
00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:08.566
new Default Pawn Blueprint. I'll show you that in a minute and specify it here.

64
00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:12.566
The Default Mode Pawn Blueprint thingy will be here.

65
00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:16.566
and it will be something that we could create in the world. like this. if I've modified the shape into a

66
00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:20.566
rugby ball. to prove that it's a different version. And that thing there can be

67
00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:24.566
edited. We can change the Default Pawn and we can change its

68
00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:28.566
size and it's shape. and crucially we can change the fact that it has a grabber on it!

69
00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:32.566
So. we'll make this different. slightly odd shaped Default Pawn. We'll probably

70
00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:36.566
put the shape back afterwards. just to prove that we're making changes

71
00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:40.566
and that the Grabber component will be added. So. once we've done that and we've

72
00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:44.566
made this Default Pawn thing. that's based on Pawn. we will then be able to pass that

73
00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:48.566
back to the Game Mode and say. here Game Mode. this is the thing that you need to be

74
00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:52.566
instantiating when the game starts. This new Default Pawn. I'll

75
00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:56.566
just call BP for Blueprint. Alright. so that's an overview of how we're going to

76
00:04:56.566 --> 00:05:00.566
do all this. What remains next to just get on and make that happen!

77
00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:04.566
But before we do. I just want to tell you a tiny bit about Game Mode. so that you can go off and read about

78
00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:08.566
it. So. Unreal describes the Game Mode as "Anything from what inventory

79
00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:12.566
items a player starts with or how many lives are available to time limits

80
00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:16.566
and the score needed to end the game belongs to GameMode."

81
00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:20.566
So the parameters. the rules of the game in general. You can go ahead

82
00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:24.566
and click that link there. from the digital version of the slides. or just Google

83
00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:28.566
for it and read a little bit more about Unreal's GameMode now. And I'll see you in the next video.

84
00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:31.999
and we'll start putting it all together!

Welcome to Grabbing System Overviews!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, in this video we're going to do a quick look at the end result of the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
next few videos, because it's going to be a mini series about how to create a

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, you can try and think about how it may be done, as a part of this video,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and I'll be outlining how we'll be doing it, So, you can think about it, work out what

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that and just watch this video. Nothing to actually do in Unreal, until the next video.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,566

So, let's take a look at roughly how this may end up! We're going to play the game!

00:00:56,566 --> 00:01:00,566
hold of it and that means that we can then move and manipulate it around the scene.

17
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:04,566
OK, so how may this work? Well,

00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:08,566
the first thing I want you to do is, just write down your ideas, using your knowledge to date, as to how

23
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:28,566
How might you know what to grab? How

24
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,566
might you ask the game what to grab? You see, you don't know the answers to these questions, but what I

25
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:36,566

work. So, I just want you to get in the habit of thinking about a chunk of work like this, like a grabbing

31
00:01:56,566 --> 00:02:00,566
system. That's going to take several lectures worth of teaching to get it out.

32
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:04,566

but that's part of the process, so have a go!

35
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,566
Welcome back! So, let's take an overview of how I

36
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:20,566
plan to do the grabbing system. We want to be able to life the chair next, as I said. So,

37
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:24,566
we'll add a Grabber.cpp component to the player. Now, remember that the

38
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:28,566
player, in this case, is a default pawn, and it's a Default Pawn that we don't

39
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:32,566
have access to until the game runs, which will introduce some interesting

40
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:36,566
challenges. So, the player is a temporary actor and

41
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:40,566
it appears on play. The player is a Default Pawn, a pawn is an actor,

42
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:44,566
so the player, the temporary actor, the Default Pawn, they're all the same thing, and they

43
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:48,566
don't appear until the game starts playing. It's the Game Mode, which sets

44
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:52,566
which Default Pawn to use, so

45
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:56,566
we need to be making a modification to the Game Mode. So, we're going to create a Default

46
00:02:56,566 --> 00:03:00,566
Pawn and a Game Mode Blueprint. We're going to do both of those in Blueprint, because it's just

47
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:04,566
easier, and you'll see why later on. It avoids something called hard coding of

48
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:08,566
assets. What that means is, we don't end up typing the exact name of

49
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:12,566
our modified Default Pawn into code, because

50
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:16,566
if we do that and we change the name in the editor, then it won't be tracked.

51
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:20,566
So, we'll see why Blueprint is very useful for binding assets to our code.

52
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:24,566
And once we have changed the Game Mode

53
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:28,566
and made ourselves a new Default Pawn, we will specify

54
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:32,566
our modified Default Pawn to the Game Mode. So, all sounds a bit

55
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:36,566
confusing doesn't it? Let's work from the top and just think about it once more. Let me show you

56
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:40,566
it in action. Bear in mind, your project won't look like this right now, because I have it setup.

57
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:44,566
This is the end result of the next few lectures, alright. So, what I'm saying is that under

58
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:48,566
Project Settings and Maps and Mode, what

59
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:52,566
we're going to end up with is a different Game Mode. We're going to make a Blueprinted version of our Game Mode.

60
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,566
Previously we had this set, and that doesn't let you choose the Default Pawn

61
00:03:56,566 --> 00:04:00,566

62
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:04,566
change to a Blueprint version, after having made it. We will then make a

63
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:08,566
new Default Pawn Blueprint. I'll show you that in a minute and specify it here.

64
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:12,566
The Default Mode Pawn Blueprint thingy will be here,

65
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:16,566
and it will be something that we could create in the world, like this, if I've modified the shape into a

66
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:20,566
rugby ball, to prove that it's a different version. And that thing there can be

67
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:24,566
edited. We can change the Default Pawn and we can change its

68
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:28,566
size and it's shape, and crucially we can change the fact that it has a grabber on it!

69
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:32,566
So, we'll make this different, slightly odd shaped Default Pawn. We'll probably

70
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:36,566
put the shape back afterwards, just to prove that we're making changes

71
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:40,566
and that the Grabber component will be added. So, once we've done that and we've

72
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:44,566
made this Default Pawn thing, that's based on Pawn, we will then be able to pass that

73
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:48,566
back to the Game Mode and say, here Game Mode, this is the thing that you need to be

74
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:52,566
instantiating when the game starts. This new Default Pawn, I'll

75
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:56,566
just call BP for Blueprint. Alright, so that's an overview of how we're going to

76
00:04:56,566 --> 00:05:00,566
do all this. What remains next to just get on and make that happen!

77
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,566
But before we do, I just want to tell you a tiny bit about Game Mode, so that you can go off and read about

78
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:08,566
it. So, Unreal describes the Game Mode as "Anything from what inventory

79
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:12,566
items a player starts with or how many lives are available to time limits

80
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:16,566
and the score needed to end the game belongs to GameMode."

81
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,566
So the parameters, the rules of the game in general. You can go ahead

82
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:24,566
and click that link there, from the digital version of the slides, or just Google

83
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:28,566
for it and read a little bit more about Unreal's GameMode now. And I'll see you in the next video,

84
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:31,999
and we'll start putting it all together!
