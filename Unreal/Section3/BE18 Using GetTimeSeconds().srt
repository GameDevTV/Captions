00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Using GetTImeSeconds()! It's a lot more fun than it sounds. In this video.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we're going to be using GetWorld() and then ->GetTimeSeconds(0. We'll be making our

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
game highly play tunable. be refactoring our code

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for simplicity. We'll be using a spotlight to provide some

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
affordance to guide the player as to what they need to be doing. and we'll be play-testing

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to ensure the game is annoying. annoying enough to really give them the motivation to want to escape!

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
By the end of it. we will have a situation something like this. We will be able

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to find a spotlight. stand on it. see some doors open. and have them close in

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
our face. as we run towards them so that we can't get out! So.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.433
let's see how that's done!

12
00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:45.433
OK guys. let's do this thing! I'm really excited. because I know how frustrating this game is going to

13
00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:49.433
be at the end of this relatively short video. Actually. it might end up being quite a long video.

14
00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:53.433
Anyway let's do it! So. what we want is to have this

15
00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:57.433
TriggerVolume... I'm actually going to move it around and do a couple of things first. I'm going to move it in

16
00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.433
the ground plane. Notice I'm dragging it in a very specific place on that

17
00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:05.433
right angle there. We're going to move it in the ground plane. to say the corder of the room for fun.

18
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:09.433
lift it up. scale it up with the R Key...

19
00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:13.433
R Key. there we go! Might as well have it go all the way up there.

20
00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:17.433
And then. what I'm going to do is I'm going to do is I'm going to come and put a light in to give some affordance.

21
00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:21.433
i.e. some indication to the player as to what on earth they need to be

22
00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:25.433
doing. So if I come into the quad view. get overhead this

23
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:29.433
squarey thing. Trigger Volume. I'm going to go to the Modes Panel

24
00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:33.433
and Lights and Spot Light. and I'm going to drop it

25
00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:37.433
in the scene. is probably easiest. something like that. And then. using all these other views. I'm

26
00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:41.433
going to just move it around until... It doesn't

27
00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:45.433
really matter. The idea is it's going to make a big messy

28
00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:49.433
mark on the floor. Let's just move this

29
00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:53.433
here. down in there. And what I'm trying to do

30
00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:57.433
is just get the Spot Light over the center. or

31
00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:01.433
roughly the center of the pressure pad. which is

32
00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:05.433
like that.

33
00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:09.433
Confusing things in here. so the pressure pad is the green. the trigger

34
00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:13.433
volume... There we go. finally there! Now. what you need to do.

35
00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:17.433
once your light is where you want it. is to go into the details of the light and

36
00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:21.433
mess around with things like the intensity. By the way. you can click on the number 5.000 and

37
00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:25.433
then just drag until it has the desired effect. OK. you can change the

38
00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:29.433
cone angles here. so I'd prefer my cone is somewhat

39
00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:33.433
constrained to the TriggerVolume. The Inner and Outer Cone Angle. you can make it quite...

40
00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:37.433
Let's go back into the 3D. You can make it quite focused if you like. like

41
00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:41.433
this. It's kind of saying this is the area that this thing is going to work in. We could make it a little more

42
00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:45.433
subtle. This is a bit screaming at you. like go stand over here. but if we made it a bit

43
00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:49.433
more subtle and perhaps say the color of... I mean later on thinking

44
00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:53.433
that maybe the chair is the thing that triggers this. so we could use the Color Picker

45
00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:57.433
from the chair. although it's not doing a great job. so I'm just going to

46
00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:01.433
pick a yellow that looks a bit like it. somewhere around there.

47
00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:05.433
Yeah. so the light has some sort of indication of the chair. which might indicate

48
00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:09.433
that they might want to drag the chair over there later. Let's have a look! The point is

49
00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:13.433
it's kind of subtle but there's a visual cue that you may want to stand here and that. that opens

50
00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:17.433
the doors. Cool! Let's deal with the delays guys. without further delay!

51
00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:21.433
Click on the door. let's go into the OpenDoor code...

52
00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:25.433


53
00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:29.433
...and let's start thinking about how we're going to do this. So. in order to

54
00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:33.433
put a delay in. what we're going to need to do is have some concept of time.

55
00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:37.433
So. what have we got in terms of the time component?

56
00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:41.433
Well. if we get the world. once we've got the world and start looking for

57
00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:45.433
methods that contain time. then let's see what we have.

58
00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:49.433
While we wait for Visual Studio to finish loading and working out how it's autocomplete

59
00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:53.433
works. let's just go to Google. get time Unreal's

60
00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:57.433
c++ would be an example of a Google search you could do here. and

61
00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:01.433
"Get current system time and date". That type of answer might lead you to it!

62
00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:05.433
I've got something from Visual Studio stuck on my screen. Let's just see if I can...

63
00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:09.433
That's popping over the... There you go! Hmm?

64
00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:13.433
It's not leading to a lot of good results. Let me just tell you the answer. We want "gettime

65
00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:17.433
seconds". OK.

66
00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:21.433
Unreal. UWorld::GetTimeSeconds. And the thing about this is. it "Returns

67
00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:25.433
the time in seconds since the world is brought up for play" and it "IS stopped when game

68
00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:29.433
pauses" or if we change the time scale. if the game slows

69
00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:33.433
down or speeds up. like it was slow motion or something. So. that's what we want. GetTimeSeconds

70
00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:37.433
and it's from the world. so let's go in and take a look. I seem to have

71
00:04:37.433 --> 00:04:41.433
two editors open. This can happen. so if it does happen what you need to do is

72
00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:45.433
make sure you close the one where you didn't make your changes. There you go!

73
00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:49.433
So. GetTimeSeconds()

74
00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:53.433
and there it is! So. that is how we return the seconds! So. what are we

75
00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:57.433
going to need? Well. what I'm going to do is make myself something. a couple of

76
00:04:57.433 --> 00:05:01.433
different variable here. One is going to be editable anywhere. and it's going to

77
00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:05.433
be something that says. to the designer. what is

78
00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:09.433
the DoorCloseDelay as a float.

79
00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:13.433
floating point number? OK. and let's give it a sensible value

80
00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:17.433
to start with. 1 second perhaps. DoorCloseDelay.

81
00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:21.433
We're also going to need a few other privates here. for this guy

82
00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:25.433
to work. So. we're going to need to know float. Why float? Why is it a floating point

83
00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:29.433
number? Because you can't count it on your fingers. it has a decimal point in it.

84
00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:33.433
LastDoorOpenTime;

85
00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:37.433
that would make sense. and I think that's probably

86
00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:41.433
all we need for now. We may also need a level low time

87
00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:45.433
or something. but let's just see how we go with this. So. we've got a couple of things

88
00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:49.433
to store time in now. Now. what we need to do is write some code that's actually

89
00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:53.433
going to check when the door last opened. So. the

90
00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:57.433
first thing we're going to need to do here is. once the door is opened. we're going to say Door

91
00:05:57.433 --> 00:06:01.433
LastOpenTime = this

92
00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:05.433
guy here. Yeah.

93
00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:09.433
that's fine! So. you open the door and you store when you open the door.

94
00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:13.433
Now. what we're going to need to do is regularly check to see if it's time to

95
00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:17.433
close the door. just underneath here. So. "// Check

96
00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:21.433
if it's time to close the door".

97
00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:25.433
And if we do. we're going to call a closed door method. Now. I'm going to leave you to write

98
00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:29.433
"// Check if it's time to close the door". But I'm just going to refactor. do some refactor. I'm going to Open

99
00:06:29.433 --> 00:06:33.433
Door() with you. so that we can make the ClosedDoor() method really simple. So. let's go look at

100
00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:37.433
OpenDoor() and let's copy it.

101
00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:41.433
make a new method called ClosedDoor() because it's so similar.

102
00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:45.433
and let's take a look at it! So. it's big right? It's a bit too much!

103
00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:49.433
It's not so easy looking at OpenDoor() and ClosedDoor() to see exactly what they do. So.

104
00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:53.433
AActor* Owner. they both need Owner. so why don't we have a private

105
00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:57.433
variable here called AActor* Owner;

106
00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:01.433
and this is "// The owning door". OK.

107
00:07:01.433 --> 00:07:05.433
and then. we can go and set the Owner on Begin

108
00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:09.433
Play(). So. on BeginPlay() we find

109
00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:13.433
the Owner and the Actor that opens. so therefore we don't need this

110
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:17.433
AActor* Owner = GetOwner(); to happen in the OpenDoor() or the ClosedDoor().

111
00:07:17.433 --> 00:07:21.433
And somewhat I did that. I just pulled it out!

112
00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:25.433
I took it out and said OK. this guy has a private property that

113
00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:29.433
is found on Start(). and therefore we don't need to use it both open and close. We've made it a more

114
00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:33.433
global variable. Cool! Now. ClosedDoor(). did we ever make Closed

115
00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:37.433
Door() a method here? We didn't! We need to say void ClosedDoor() in the header file. because

116
00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:41.433
that's C++ making our life a little bit harder. but

117
00:07:41.433 --> 00:07:45.433
makes also things very clear. Good! So we now have ClosedDoor(). so this will

118
00:07:45.433 --> 00:07:49.433
stop complaining eventually. I also think that we don't need this complexity of creating the rotator

119
00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:53.433
and then calling it. I think that we can take this f rotator and stick it

120
00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:57.433
straight in here. So that gets rid of all that code. remember less code is better. And also.

121
00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:01.433
this angle is hard coded. whereas we've actually already made ourselves

122
00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:05.433
an OpenAngle thing. It should be -90 degrees.

123
00:08:05.433 --> 00:08:09.433
as a default. and then. here we can just say OpenAngle.

124
00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:13.433
Does that make sense? So we've really simplified OpenDoor()

125
00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:17.433
and we don't even need the comment. because it's obvious it sets the rotation. OpenDoor() just sets the

126
00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:21.433
rotation to the open angle. Simple. what does ClosedDoor() do? Well.

127
00:08:21.433 --> 00:08:25.433
it's just going to set the door's rotation and your roll pitch to 0.

128
00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:29.433
OK. so again. we don't need any of this stuff.

129
00:08:29.433 --> 00:08:33.433
How simple is that now? That's what you want! OpenDoor(). ClosedDoor() just reads

130
00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:37.433
English simple. It's worth it! Make the effort. refactor. refactor. refactor! OK

131
00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:41.433
guys. you've got a ClosedDoor() method to call now. I want you to write the code that goes in

132
00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:45.433
here. that is continuously checked to see if it's time to close the door.

133
00:08:45.433 --> 00:08:49.433
Implement close door delay. Write some simple timing code. get the doors closing after a specified

134
00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:53.433
delay. play-test to ensure you can't escape.

135
00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:57.433


136
00:08:57.433 --> 00:09:01.433
OK welcome back. let's get this done! So. it's relatively a simple thing to do! We

137
00:09:01.433 --> 00:09:05.433
just need to say. if and then this thing here. Now. you might argue. you

138
00:09:05.433 --> 00:09:09.433
might want to store the time in seconds in a variable but that's fine. If

139
00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:13.433
the current time - the LastDoorOpenTime is greater than

140
00:09:13.433 --> 00:09:17.433
the... What do we call it? DoorCloseDelay.

141
00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:21.433
then...

142
00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:25.433
CloseDoor(). I know it almost seems too simple when you

143
00:09:25.433 --> 00:09:29.433
get all the naming right. when everything lines up. it is almost too simple.

144
00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:33.433
and that's what you want. And it's almost too simple. because we've made the effort.

145
00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:37.433
Go over to Unreal.Â I'm just going to make sure by compiling here. because

146
00:09:37.433 --> 00:09:41.433
what I see in Visual Studio is that this compiled a bit too quick for my liking.

147
00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:45.433
So. to make sure it's compiled. I'm compiling over in Visual Studio. Now. let's play and see what

148
00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:49.433
happens! Go into the light. they open. move out... Do they close?

149
00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:53.433
They do! Perfect! Can I escape? Ah yes! So. how do

150
00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:57.433
I play-tune it? Now. this is the beauty of the way we've set this up! Have a little look!

151
00:09:57.433 --> 00:10:01.433
How do we play-tune it? Well. you click on the door. you go to the OpenDoor. look what I've got! Ooh.

152
00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:05.433
my Open Angle is not controllable. so let me just quickly fix

153
00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:09.433
that in here. The reason it's not editable is because we've changed it to (VisibleAnywhere).

154
00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:13.433
whereas it could be (EditAnywhere). OK. so that is

155
00:10:13.433 --> 00:10:17.433
easy! Save back in Unreal. We can quickly compile.

156
00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:21.433
As soon as that compile finishes. this Open Angle should become editable.

157
00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:25.433
So this door is going to open 90 degrees.

158
00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:29.433
when something intercepts the Trigger

159
00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:33.433
Volume and we have

160
00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:37.433
a DoorCloseDelay of 1 second. Let's try half a second!

161
00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:41.433
OK. let's try that door then. So. we come over here. boom. and it closes

162
00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:45.433
in our face! Great! Now. let's take the other door. What time

163
00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:49.433
does that need to be? -90. I'm actually going to have it open less. -60 just for fun.

164
00:10:49.433 --> 00:10:53.433
And the Close Delay. you can click on here and drag and I'm going to try 0.7-ish.

165
00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:57.433
So. can I get out of this door? Not quite! How annoying!

166
00:10:57.433 --> 00:11:01.433
So. the game is finally really annoying! Look I'm stuck! [Grumbles]

167
00:11:01.433 --> 00:11:05.433
[Grumbles] I can't get out! OK. so now I'm really annoyed! I'm this drone or something

168
00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:09.433
flying around in this room. I can't get out of the sealing! I can see freedom. I can taste it. I can

169
00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:13.433
smell it. but I can't get out. and I can't get out of these doors either!

170
00:11:13.433 --> 00:11:17.433
So not a problem. we will have a solution. which I think in my game

171
00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:21.433
is going to be moving that chair over the pressure plate and dealing with how that's going to work. We have

172
00:11:21.433 --> 00:11:24.700
affordance. The color of this light is the color of the chair. It's subtle visual

173
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.966
hints. and that's what we'll deal with next!

=======

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Using GetTImeSeconds()! It's a lot more fun than it sounds. In this video,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we're going to be using GetWorld() and then ->GetTimeSeconds(0. We'll be making our

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
game highly play tunable, be refactoring our code

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
for simplicity. We'll be using a spotlight to provide some

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
affordance to guide the player as to what they need to be doing, and we'll be play-testing

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to ensure the game is annoying, annoying enough to really give them the motivation to want to escape!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
By the end of it, we will have a situation something like this. We will be able

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to find a spotlight, stand on it, see some doors open, and have them close in

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
our face, as we run towards them so that we can't get out! So,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,433
let's see how that's done!

12
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:45,433
OK guys, let's do this thing! I'm really excited, because I know how frustrating this game is going to

13
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:49,433
be at the end of this relatively short video. Actually, it might end up being quite a long video.

14
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:53,433
Anyway let's do it! So, what we want is to have this

15
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:57,433
TriggerVolume... I'm actually going to move it around and do a couple of things first. I'm going to move it in

16
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,433
the ground plane. Notice I'm dragging it in a very specific place on that

17
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:05,433
right angle there. We're going to move it in the ground plane, to say the corder of the room for fun,

18
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:09,433
lift it up, scale it up with the R Key...

19
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:13,433
R Key, there we go! Might as well have it go all the way up there.

20
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:17,433
And then, what I'm going to do is I'm going to do is I'm going to come and put a light in to give some affordance,

21
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:21,433
i.e. some indication to the player as to what on earth they need to be

22
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,433
doing. So if I come into the quad view, get overhead this

23
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:29,433
squarey thing, Trigger Volume. I'm going to go to the Modes Panel

24
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:33,433
and Lights and Spot Light, and I'm going to drop it

25
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:37,433
in the scene, is probably easiest, something like that. And then, using all these other views, I'm

26
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:41,433
going to just move it around until... It doesn't

27
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:45,433
really matter. The idea is it's going to make a big messy

28
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:49,433
mark on the floor. Let's just move this

29
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:53,433
here, down in there. And what I'm trying to do

30
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:57,433
is just get the Spot Light over the center, or

31
00:01:57,433 --> 00:02:01,433
roughly the center of the pressure pad, which is

32
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:05,433
like that.

33
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:09,433
Confusing things in here, so the pressure pad is the green, the trigger

34
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:13,433
volume... There we go, finally there! Now, what you need to do,

35
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,433
once your light is where you want it, is to go into the details of the light and

36
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:21,433
mess around with things like the intensity. By the way, you can click on the number 5,000 and

37
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,433
then just drag until it has the desired effect. OK, you can change the

38
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:29,433
cone angles here, so I'd prefer my cone is somewhat

39
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:33,433
constrained to the TriggerVolume. The Inner and Outer Cone Angle, you can make it quite...

40
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:37,433
Let's go back into the 3D. You can make it quite focused if you like, like

41
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:41,433
this. It's kind of saying this is the area that this thing is going to work in. We could make it a little more

42
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:45,433
subtle. This is a bit screaming at you, like go stand over here, but if we made it a bit

43
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:49,433
more subtle and perhaps say the color of... I mean later on thinking

44
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:53,433
that maybe the chair is the thing that triggers this, so we could use the Color Picker

45
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:57,433
from the chair, although it's not doing a great job, so I'm just going to

46
00:02:57,433 --> 00:03:01,433
pick a yellow that looks a bit like it, somewhere around there.

47
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:05,433
Yeah, so the light has some sort of indication of the chair, which might indicate

48
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:09,433
that they might want to drag the chair over there later. Let's have a look! The point is

49
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:13,433
it's kind of subtle but there's a visual cue that you may want to stand here and that, that opens

50
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:17,433
the doors. Cool! Let's deal with the delays guys, without further delay!

51
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:21,433
Click on the door, let's go into the OpenDoor code...

52
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:25,433


53
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:29,433
...and let's start thinking about how we're going to do this. So, in order to

54
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:33,433
put a delay in, what we're going to need to do is have some concept of time.

55
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:37,433
So, what have we got in terms of the time component?

56
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:41,433
Well, if we get the world, once we've got the world and start looking for

57
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:45,433
methods that contain time, then let's see what we have.

58
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,433
While we wait for Visual Studio to finish loading and working out how it's autocomplete

59
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:53,433
works, let's just go to Google, get time Unreal's

60
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,433
c++ would be an example of a Google search you could do here, and

61
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:01,433
"Get current system time and date". That type of answer might lead you to it!

62
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:05,433
I've got something from Visual Studio stuck on my screen. Let's just see if I can...

63
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:09,433
That's popping over the... There you go! Hmm?

64
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:13,433
It's not leading to a lot of good results. Let me just tell you the answer. We want "gettime

65
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:17,433
seconds". OK,

66
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:21,433
Unreal, UWorld::GetTimeSeconds. And the thing about this is, it "Returns

67
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:25,433
the time in seconds since the world is brought up for play" and it "IS stopped when game

68
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:29,433
pauses" or if we change the time scale, if the game slows

69
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:33,433
down or speeds up, like it was slow motion or something. So, that's what we want, GetTimeSeconds

70
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:37,433
and it's from the world, so let's go in and take a look. I seem to have

71
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:41,433
two editors open. This can happen, so if it does happen what you need to do is

72
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:45,433
make sure you close the one where you didn't make your changes. There you go!

73
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:49,433
So, GetTimeSeconds()

74
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:53,433
and there it is! So, that is how we return the seconds! So, what are we

75
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:57,433
going to need? Well, what I'm going to do is make myself something, a couple of

76
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:01,433
different variable here. One is going to be editable anywhere, and it's going to

77
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:05,433
be something that says, to the designer, what is

78
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:09,433
the DoorCloseDelay as a float,

79
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:13,433
floating point number? OK, and let's give it a sensible value

80
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:17,433
to start with, 1 second perhaps. DoorCloseDelay.

81
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:21,433
We're also going to need a few other privates here, for this guy

82
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:25,433
to work. So, we're going to need to know float. Why float? Why is it a floating point

83
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:29,433
number? Because you can't count it on your fingers, it has a decimal point in it.

84
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:33,433
LastDoorOpenTime;

85
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,433
that would make sense, and I think that's probably

86
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:41,433
all we need for now. We may also need a level low time

87
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:45,433
or something, but let's just see how we go with this. So, we've got a couple of things

88
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:49,433
to store time in now. Now, what we need to do is write some code that's actually

89
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,433
going to check when the door last opened. So, the

90
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:57,433
first thing we're going to need to do here is, once the door is opened, we're going to say Door

91
00:05:57,433 --> 00:06:01,433
LastOpenTime = this

92
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:05,433
guy here. Yeah,

93
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:09,433
that's fine! So, you open the door and you store when you open the door.

94
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:13,433
Now, what we're going to need to do is regularly check to see if it's time to

95
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:17,433
close the door, just underneath here. So, "// Check

96
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:21,433
if it's time to close the door".

97
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:25,433
And if we do, we're going to call a closed door method. Now, I'm going to leave you to write

98
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:29,433
"// Check if it's time to close the door". But I'm just going to refactor, do some refactor. I'm going to Open

99
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:33,433
Door() with you, so that we can make the ClosedDoor() method really simple. So, let's go look at

100
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:37,433
OpenDoor() and let's copy it,

101
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:41,433
make a new method called ClosedDoor() because it's so similar,

102
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:45,433
and let's take a look at it! So, it's big right? It's a bit too much!

103
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:49,433
It's not so easy looking at OpenDoor() and ClosedDoor() to see exactly what they do. So,

104
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:53,433
AActor* Owner, they both need Owner, so why don't we have a private

105
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:57,433
variable here called AActor* Owner;

106
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:01,433
and this is "// The owning door". OK,

107
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:05,433
and then, we can go and set the Owner on Begin

108
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:09,433
Play(). So, on BeginPlay() we find

109
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:13,433
the Owner and the Actor that opens, so therefore we don't need this

110
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,433
AActor* Owner = GetOwner(); to happen in the OpenDoor() or the ClosedDoor().

111
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:21,433
And somewhat I did that. I just pulled it out!

112
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:25,433
I took it out and said OK, this guy has a private property that

113
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:29,433
is found on Start(), and therefore we don't need to use it both open and close. We've made it a more

114
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:33,433
global variable. Cool! Now, ClosedDoor(), did we ever make Closed

115
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:37,433
Door() a method here? We didn't! We need to say void ClosedDoor() in the header file, because

116
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:41,433
that's C++ making our life a little bit harder, but

117
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:45,433
makes also things very clear. Good! So we now have ClosedDoor(), so this will

118
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:49,433
stop complaining eventually. I also think that we don't need this complexity of creating the rotator

119
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:53,433
and then calling it. I think that we can take this f rotator and stick it

120
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:57,433
straight in here. So that gets rid of all that code, remember less code is better. And also,

121
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:01,433
this angle is hard coded, whereas we've actually already made ourselves

122
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:05,433
an OpenAngle thing. It should be -90 degrees,

123
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:09,433
as a default, and then, here we can just say OpenAngle.

124
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:13,433
Does that make sense? So we've really simplified OpenDoor()

125
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:17,433
and we don't even need the comment, because it's obvious it sets the rotation. OpenDoor() just sets the

126
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:21,433
rotation to the open angle. Simple, what does ClosedDoor() do? Well,

127
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:25,433
it's just going to set the door's rotation and your roll pitch to 0.

128
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:29,433
OK, so again, we don't need any of this stuff.

129
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:33,433
How simple is that now? That's what you want! OpenDoor(), ClosedDoor() just reads

130
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:37,433
English simple. It's worth it! Make the effort, refactor, refactor, refactor! OK

131
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,433
guys, you've got a ClosedDoor() method to call now. I want you to write the code that goes in

132
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:45,433
here, that is continuously checked to see if it's time to close the door.

133
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:49,433
Implement close door delay. Write some simple timing code, get the doors closing after a specified

134
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:53,433
delay, play-test to ensure you can't escape.

135
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:57,433


136
00:08:57,433 --> 00:09:01,433
OK welcome back, let's get this done! So, it's relatively a simple thing to do! We

137
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:05,433
just need to say, if and then this thing here. Now, you might argue, you

138
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:09,433
might want to store the time in seconds in a variable but that's fine. If

139
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:13,433
the current time - the LastDoorOpenTime is greater than

140
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:17,433
the... What do we call it? DoorCloseDelay,

141
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:21,433
then...

142
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:25,433
CloseDoor(). I know it almost seems too simple when you

143
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:29,433
get all the naming right, when everything lines up, it is almost too simple,

144
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:33,433
and that's what you want. And it's almost too simple, because we've made the effort.

145
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:37,433
Go over to Unreal.Â I'm just going to make sure by compiling here, because

146
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:41,433
what I see in Visual Studio is that this compiled a bit too quick for my liking.

147
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:45,433
So, to make sure it's compiled, I'm compiling over in Visual Studio. Now, let's play and see what

148
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:49,433
happens! Go into the light, they open, move out... Do they close?

149
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:53,433
They do! Perfect! Can I escape? Ah yes! So, how do

150
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:57,433
I play-tune it? Now, this is the beauty of the way we've set this up! Have a little look!

151
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:01,433
How do we play-tune it? Well, you click on the door, you go to the OpenDoor, look what I've got! Ooh,

152
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:05,433
my Open Angle is not controllable, so let me just quickly fix

153
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:09,433
that in here. The reason it's not editable is because we've changed it to (VisibleAnywhere),

154
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:13,433
whereas it could be (EditAnywhere). OK, so that is

155
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:17,433
easy! Save back in Unreal. We can quickly compile.

156
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:21,433
As soon as that compile finishes, this Open Angle should become editable.

157
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:25,433
So this door is going to open 90 degrees,

158
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:29,433
when something intercepts the Trigger

159
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:33,433
Volume and we have

160
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,433
a DoorCloseDelay of 1 second. Let's try half a second!

161
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:41,433
OK, let's try that door then. So, we come over here, boom, and it closes

162
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:45,433
in our face! Great! Now, let's take the other door. What time

163
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:49,433
does that need to be? -90, I'm actually going to have it open less, -60 just for fun.

164
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:53,433
And the Close Delay, you can click on here and drag and I'm going to try 0.7-ish.

165
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:57,433
So, can I get out of this door? Not quite! How annoying!

166
00:10:57,433 --> 00:11:01,433
So, the game is finally really annoying! Look I'm stuck! [Grumbles]

167
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:05,433
[Grumbles] I can't get out! OK, so now I'm really annoyed! I'm this drone or something

168
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:09,433
flying around in this room, I can't get out of the sealing! I can see freedom, I can taste it, I can

169
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:13,433
smell it, but I can't get out, and I can't get out of these doors either!

170
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:17,433
So not a problem, we will have a solution, which I think in my game

171
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:21,433
is going to be moving that chair over the pressure plate and dealing with how that's going to work. We have

172
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,700
affordance. The color of this light is the color of the chair. It's subtle visual

173
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,966
hints, and that's what we'll deal with next!
