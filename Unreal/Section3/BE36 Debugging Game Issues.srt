00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So. welcome

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to Debugging Game Issues! This is a little bit different to debugging

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
code issues. cause our particular bug we're seeing. with our drifting

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Pawn. is not actually caused directly by a code issue. so a slightly different

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
approach when it's an engine editor side issue. So. in this video

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
firstly. I want to ask you are you using Source Control yet? Are you using SourceTree.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
GitHub. some sort of Source Control? If not. then I would really urge you to start now.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
even if you just zip up your project after each

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
video. The problem with doing that. of course. is you end up with a massive amount of data. because every time

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
you zip up your project. it's going to get bigger and bigger. You could delete all the

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
derived files we've talked about. binaries. build. intermediate. saved. etc.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then. just zip that up if you wanted to. But please

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
do the difficult thing. and you know. I've heard somebody say that if you do what's easy life will be

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
hard and if you do what's hard life will be easy. paradoxically. So. consider

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
getting into Source Control. if you're not already. Sorry to lecture you if you already are. So.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
once you're using Source Control you can use binary search. You

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
can binary search commits pretty fast. So what I mean by that is. even if you've got

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
1.024 commits. remember that 2 to the power of 10 is 1.024.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So. as I'll show you in a second. even if you had 1.000 commits. you could

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
chop that search space in half. just 10 times

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and get down to the commit where the problem started. if that's what we want to be able to do.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
as I've just said. So. think about what's changed and what the

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
possible side-effects are of what changed and what could be causing the problem.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and remember that you can eject with F8 during gameplay.

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So let me just show you this Source Control business. show you about ejecting.

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and then. we will challenge you to go and find the solution to this

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
problem. So. let's recap what the problem is. The problem is that some of the time. when

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we say pick up the table and let go. look we're kind of drifting around now.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
What's going on with that drift? Now. remember you can hit F8

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and F8 will take you out of the body of the

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Default Pawn. Now. I'm not going to look back at it. because that will show you the solution which you're going to do in a moment.

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But remember you can use F8. which is the same. by the way. as

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
clicking Eject. But of course. once you've come into the game window and

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you've started using your mouse. you can no longer click that Eject Button right. You can't

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
look up at it. so you have to hit the F8 Key. The other thing I wanted to just

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
recap was what I was talking about with the Source Controls. So. here I've got 35 commits. Let's call

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
it 32 for the lectures. Now. 2 to the power of 5 is 32.

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which means that even if I didn't know at all. even from the beginning of the

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
project where this problem started; I could go well. let's do a round 16

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
about half way through. check out there. see if the problem exists there.

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
if it does then it happened before that and if it doesn't it happened after that. Let's

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
imagine it happened after 16. Well then. we go well let's go half way between 16 and 32 about

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
here somewhere. Is the problem existent there? Say maybe no.

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
OK. so it happened later. Is it existent there? Yes! OK. so it happened half

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
way between there and there. and you can see you really quickly can hone in on

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the place where the problem started. Then. you can start to think. well what changed between

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
these two videos or between these two commit stages. in your case.

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And you can say. oh well I changed the door asset or I changed the. you know. something.

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And you can see that. actually. a few videos ago... I don't know quite where

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
it was. We change something about the Default Pawn.

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I think it may have been pretty recent. I think it was in the last video? Yeah! It's something

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
changed on the Default Pawn. unfortunately we can't see what. So. your

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
challenge is to find and eliminate this drifting bug. I'm using the word drifting because the other

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
word would solve it for you. When did it come in? Well. it looks like in the last video or the last

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
few. What feature did we recently enable. of the Default Pawn?

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Go look at the Default Pawn blueprint. and then. have a

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
look under the Details Tab at both the Pawn itself. the root object. but also the

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
collision object. the collision component. How did the Pawn

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
look when ejected? Look back at it. see what it's doing.

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm going to give you a couple of hints. One hint is. by the way.

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
if you don't want the hints pause now and go and solve the problem. If you do want the hints. then hint number 1

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
is enabling physics caused the issue. That's what caused it.

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And if you want more hints... Then go ahead and try and solve it yourself first. before

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
listening to the second hint. Go and pause! Go do it do it do it!

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
In case you need more help and you want to solve this challenge. go

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to the Collision Component of the default pawn blueprint. and then look at the Constraints section

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and under Details and then Physics and that will give you something that you can tick

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
or three things you can tick. which will stop the problem. So go ahead. see if you can get rid of the drifting

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
bug. OK

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
welcome back! How did you get on solving that problem? Well. according to drifting

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
bug. but as we can see when we eject and look back at the Pawn. F8

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
it's not really a drifting bug. it's more of a... Hang on. I need to

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
cause the bug in the first place. So. pick the chair up. do that.

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
we're drifting. but we're actually rolling.

75
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
There you go. you can see it rolling around. It's just a Physics

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Engine quirk this. The floor is actually flat but it's just rolling. and

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
if we look at the Default Pawn blueprint...

78
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Which how can I get to that? I can just edit it here. that's one way!

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And then. I go to the Collision Component and then I go down to Physics. You can see

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that there's no Angular Damping. there's no drag force against the rolling.

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
so once it starts rolling it carries on forever. Alright. now you

82
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.533
can't actually edit the Default Pawn while the game is running like this. so I need to stop.

83
00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:32.000
Now. of course. I can't see the Default Pawn so we go find it from our

84
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Content Browser. come down to the Collision Component

85
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because that's the thing that has Physics enabled. and I could put Angular Damping on it.

86
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and it would stop rolling quicker. So if I put say 7 units of Angular

87
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Damping. Play. pick this up.

88
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
go drop it down. Eject. and look

89
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
back before it stops. you'll see that it is rolling but then it comes to a halt. But this has

90
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
still not solved the root cause. has it? It's still weird that it's rolling. By the way. you might wonder

91
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
why this is rolling and yet our view

92
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
is not tumbling around. That's because even though it's rolling. it's staying upright and

93
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
we have. if you look in that blueprint. if I could find it again. we

94
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
have the root component of the Default Pawn. we have this Camera Base Eye Height.

95
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So what's happening is. that the camera is effectively sitting

96
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
above the Pawn. We'll just minimize that this time. so

97
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Play F8. What's happening is

98
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
that the Pawn is staying upright. even when it's rolling. and then the camera is sitting up here somewhere. just above

99
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
it. Alright. so that's why we're not tumbling. it's because the Pawn isn't actually...

100
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
The Pawn MeshObject is rotating but the

101
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
pawn base object. as you can see here. the CollisionComponent

102
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
object and it's MeshComponent are rolling. but the base Pawn

103
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
is not and the camera is hanging off the base

104
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Default Pawn here. OK. that's why you don't see a view tumbling. Now. the

105
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
solution is CollisionComponent. What you do is you come down under Constraints. So. Collision

106
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Component. Details. Physics. Constraints. and you can just lock the rotation in X.

107
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Y. and Z. And it's really handy that. and sometimes you want to log just

108
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
in one or two axes. So. if you lock that rotation now and play. then we kind

109
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
of go relatively to the root cause of it. We want to keep Physics on.

110
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So. now we can have Physics on and the problem has gone away. So there you go!

111
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Well done to those of you who spotted that. that was really good news! And

112
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that's a general approach to solving those types of problems. Work out

113
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
where they started and what the side effects could be. Don't be afraid to use Binary Search.

114
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and please get into your Source Control. So. I'm going to save everything

115
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and lead by example here. go over to Source Control. and then.

116
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I'm just going to commit those changes. Basically. I've only made a change to the Pawn

117
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
asset. We can't see that change because it's a binary asset. We can't see the details

118
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
in it. but I staged that. of course. as usual. And then. I will Commit using the current lecture

119
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
name. So. go ahead. commit your work. and I'll see you in the next video!

120
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.200
