00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi. so

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
let's have an overview of Source Control. I'm going to explain the

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
what and the way of Version Control Systems. We're going to be

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
choosing a Version Control System. VCS from now on.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We'll talk a little bit about what files to include

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or exclude from your version control. You'll see.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
over the coming lectures. how committing is saving a local snapshot of your work.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
at this point in time and how resetting is rolling back to a previous

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
state. that you had before. basically getting you out of trouble.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And we'll leave things like branching and pushing and large file support and other technical terms

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of Source Control. till much later in the course. if at all. if needed.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So firstly. what are Version Control Systems? They're

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
get out of jail cards. if you like! These things are going to allow you to keep very detailed

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
histories of your work. and make sure that you can go back to your work in

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
a state that was working and all hanging together properly. at any point in time.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which is going to be extremely useful. It's also useful for when you're working with other people.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There's a load of different systems out there. Git is one of the most popular and becoming

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
more popular very fast. Mercurial is another. Perforce.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Subversion SVN for short or TortoiseSVN.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or Alienbrain. This is great for art. and it's

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
very good for things like seeing the difference between two different images files. etc.. but it's of

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the order of $10.000. It's out of most people's budget. but it is worth

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
considering. if you're primarily wanting to control the versions of your

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
art files. Have a look on Wikipedia there. for

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a complete comparison of all Version Control software that... Well.

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
at least all of it's on Wikipedia. So. we're going to use something called

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
SourceTree. So. SourceTree is free software by a company called Atlassian.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Why do they give it away for free? Probably because it's very easy to use with their Bit

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Bucket service. which does have a paid tier which is the online portion.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We're just focusing on local source control. for now; just on keeping your computer

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
local versions of your files. Of course. you need to be backing

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
up your whole computer and your files anyway. and whatever strategy you're using for backup. whether it's

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Crash Plan or Back Blaze or hard drives or all of the

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
above. hopefully. if you're belt and braces. Then. you're Source Control

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
System will be backed up with that. but we're just talking about local source control.

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
SourceTree is a visual front end for Git or Mercurial.

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So. Git and Mercurial are two Version Control Systems. They work slightly differently behind the

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
scenes. Both are pretty applicable to what we're doing here.

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
but we're going to be using Git and we're going to be using SourceTree as a front end to Git. It just

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
makes it a lot easier. when you're learning and when you're using it. to visualize what's going on.

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There's Mac and PC versions of SourceTree. but the Mac version is a little ahead.

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
so the PC version tends to be lacking a few features. Not quite a pretty looking.

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
etc. And as I said. it's really good when you're learning. It's really

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
easy to visualize using SourceTree. so that's why we're going to be showing you SourceTree.

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So. it's challenge time! I want you to install your Version Control

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
System. Pick a Version Control System for yourself. If you're already using one.

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.400
don't change at this stage just for us. please just carry on. but if you're not.

48
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.400
we'll be using Git with SourceTree as the front-end.

49
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.400
So. Git is the underlying Version Control System. and SourceTree is just a pretty front-end

50
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.933
system we're going to be using. to make it much easier to interact with than having to remember all  the command line commands.

51
00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:24.933
Install and register it. You will need to register it. at least within the first 30 days.

52
00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:28.933
And have a quick play stroke experiment. You really can't do any harm. so  just

53
00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:32.933
make a folder. have a quick play. and as soon as you feel like you're not getting anywhere. then

54
00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:36.933
carry on watching the videos. and I will show you around SourceTree. that I already have

55
00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:40.933
installed on my machine. So go ahead. pause the video. and get yourself

56
00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:44.933
your Version Control System installed now!

57
00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:48.933
Hey welcome back! So. this

58
00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:52.933
is where you go to get Source Tree. If you do a search for Source Tree. I just want to show you

59
00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:56.933
their official page. in case you end up somewhere funny on the web. It's a strange place. the Internet!

60
00:03:56.933 --> 00:04:00.933
www.sourcetreeapp.com There you go! SourceTree. and it'll detect your

61
00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:04.933
operating system and let you download. It's going to look something like this when it's installed. Now. I'm not going to

62
00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.933
go through the install and setup. It is just a piece of software.

63
00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:12.933
and the hardest bit. maybe. is you just need to register with them. and you don't even need to do that until 30 days

64
00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:16.933
is in. I don't think. So. once you've installed SourceTree. it'll open up something

65
00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:20.933
like this! So. this is a project I've been working on recently. for the Unreal course.

66
00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:24.933
It's a piece of code from the Bull Cow Game. and this is the

67
00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:28.933
interface. It's prettier on Mac. so if you're taking this course on Mac. you'll be lamenting the

68
00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:32.933
fact that it's prettier. It's also prettier than this on a PC with a higher resolution

69
00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:36.933
screen. I'm running at 720 p hi DPI. so it all looks a bit funny but it's here!

70
00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:40.933
Now. the things that you need to focus on. really. is we're going to have one or more

71
00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:44.933
repositories. Now. what are they? Basically. it's a folder. containing all of your work for

72
00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:48.933
this section. So. in a particular section of the course. all your work is going to go in one folder

73
00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:52.933
and that will map to this repo on the left here. so each section will have one.

74
00:04:52.933 --> 00:04:56.933
And then. all of these things are actually the videos! This is the last section that I produced.

75
00:04:56.933 --> 00:05:00.933
over in the Unreal course. and each of these stages is

76
00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:04.933
exactly what I did in that video. Now. the great thing with code is. you can see

77
00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:08.933
precisely what changed. I can see exactly what I added to this file. in this

78
00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:12.933
particular revision in video 10. If you're using binary assets. Blender

79
00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:16.933
files. image files. etc. You're not going to be able to see the details using SourceTree.

80
00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:20.933
of what's changed. but it's still going to keep a perfect history for

81
00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:24.933
you. of exactly how things were at particular stages in time. So. I'm not

82
00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:28.933
going to tell you how to use this now. that's going to be in the upcoming videos. I just want you to quickly get your eye

83
00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:32.933
in. What it's going to be doing for you. once you've set it up. is this big panel

84
00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:36.933
here is going to show you what's changed since the last time. You'll be able to see

85
00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:40.933
things called un-staged files. and you'll get to choose to stage these files

86
00:05:40.933 --> 00:05:44.933
and then to commit them. which committing is a bit like

87
00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:48.933
bundling them up into a .zip file and sticking them off to one side. saying yeah. I've got to that

88
00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:52.933
stage. it's done. I want to record that as a stand point in history!

89
00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:56.933
So. that's what a commit is! And then. you're also going to be able to see later how you

90
00:05:56.933 --> 00:06:00.933
can actually go back to a previous point in time. a couple of different ways.

91
00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:04.933
and we'll be showing you Checkout and reset and the difference between those! But for now.

92
00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:08.933
all you need to know is. this is a way of storing a very powerful history. with a detail of at least what files

93
00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:12.933
have changed. and if you've got text in your files. then you're going to be able to even

94
00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:16.933
see precisely what's changed. And this means. that if you always commit

95
00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:20.933
or save your work. in a working state. if everything goes wrong and suddenly

96
00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:24.933
your whole project doesn't hang together properly. you can go back to a previous point in time

97
00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:28.933
and you are back out of trouble and able to carry on working!

98
00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:32.900
So. that's an overview of source control! Over the coming videos. you're going to see exactly how we

99
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.933
use it. and it's going to be a whole new way of thinking for you. You'll hate it at first. if

100
00:06:36.933 --> 00:06:40.933
you need to. and then you'll love it soon after! See you soon!

101
00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.799
