00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Insetting in Blender! In

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
this video, we're going to learn how to use a very powerful tool, the Inset

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Tool, and also understanding how the Outset

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
option works. So let's hop over into Blender!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the default view, as always, and

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
let's just zoom in to our cube, hop

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
on over into Edit Mode, and we're going to select

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
a face. So the Inset Tool works best when you

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
select a face, and you can find it under Mesh,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Faces, and then, Inset

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Faces. And you can see it's got the shortcut key I.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now when you inset the face, it's effectively the same

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
as, and we've just locked it in there, it's effectively

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the same as extruding that entire face by nothing,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
by moving it nowhere, creating a duplicate face on top of it,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and then scaling it inwards. And we can demonstrate that on this face

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
here. If we extrude, as we've done before, but by

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
0 and then

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
scale that down, it produces a very

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
similar result but it allows us to do it in one operation.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We can then take that new face and do what we want with

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it. Now this face here, we'll just play

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
with it a little more. If we go

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
inset and we just move it a little and left-click,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
on the left-hand side we

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
see this area here, which allows us to alter

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
what we're doing. So we've got Inset Faces, let me see we've got the Boundary, Offset

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Even, etc. etc. And now, down here, we have some finer

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
controls. So Thickness refers to how far this inset

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
has gone, and as we can see, if we adjust that, it moves up and

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
down. And, in this case, this number is

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
relative to the actual face

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
itself. So, in this case, 1 is insetting

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
all the way. Ah, so what I've done there is,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've clicked away from this inset, so it's actually set it to those

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
distances, which is not what I wanted to do. So I'm going to

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
undo what we've just done, I'm going to go and inset again,

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and left-click just the once.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So down here we've got our Thickness. If we set that to one, it will inset

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
it right to the middle. If we inset it 2.5,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
then it will inset half way, that's how that is working

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
there. The Depth is slightly different. Now the Depth allows

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you to push into your model or pull out

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
of your model. So you can do what we've just done to the top

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in one movement from here and very precisely.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now Outset is a bit different, Outset

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
keeps the new geometry in the

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
same place. Now it looks a bit weird, now that we've ticked the Outset button, so let's

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
go back and play with these numbers so we can see what happens.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now you can see that this new face here, the depth

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
is the size of that face. So if we leave it set at 0,

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
it'll be the same size as it was before, but the Thickness is

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
pushing the rest of the geometry away from that face.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So this is what it looked like, and as we push, we're

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
pushing the rest of the geometry and it's squashing away and there will be certain

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,766
times when that will be of great benefit to us.

57
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,366
Just remember that Outset, you can toggle it

58
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:51,366
on and off here, and it will remember your previous ones. If you go to Inset

59
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:55,366
again, and Outset is actually turned on,

60
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:59,366
ticked on the left-hand side there in the Operator panel, then

61
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:03,366
you may find yourself [Laughs] having difficulties, thinking it's Insetting and

62
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:07,366
it's going to be outsetting. You can also use the O key, as well, to get

63
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:11,366
out of Outset move. So armed with that knowledge,

64
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:13,533
I have a challenge for you guys!

65
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,600
Create a Mayan

66
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
pyramid. So using the Inset Tool, I'd like you to create a

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Mayan pyramid, make it at least 6 steps

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
high, and feel free to add extra detail,

69
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
if you want to. So, just for refernce, that's

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
the sort of pyramid I'm talking about, one that's basically a series of

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,166
steps up to the very top.

72
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,233
And just so you know exactly what we're looking for, at

73
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,233
this point in time, it's just the basic shape of a Mayan pyramid,

74
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:48,233
something that looks something like this. Now, of course, if you

75
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:52,233
feel confident enough to go ahead and produce something like this,

76
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:56,233
then please go ahead and, you know, really give it a go and see

77
00:04:56,233 --> 00:05:00,233
what you're capable of, but this is the stage that I'll be taking

78
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,233
it through in this challenge solution. And then, we'll go and add on the

79
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:08,233
rest of the details in the following lectures. So pause the

80
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:11,266
video now and give that a go! OK,

81
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:15,866
welcome back! Let's go through the Mayan pyramid

82
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:19,866
challenge! So I'm going to hop back over into Blender,

83
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:23,866
and I'm going to get rid of what we've got on the screen,

84
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,866
because it's not going to be a good starting point. In this case, I'm just going to start a new file.

85
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:31,866
So I'm going to want to start with the base.

86
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:35,866
So I'm simply going to scale this cube,

87
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:39,866
whilst we're still in Object Mode, that's fine, and I only want it on the X, Y,

88
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:43,866
so I'm going to exclude the Z axis with Shift Z.

89
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,866
And I'm going to pull that out, and I'm going to lock it to a size of 10.

90
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:51,866
So that's 10 times bigger in the X, Y plane and nothing

91
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,066
in the Z.

92
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:57,533
OK, so now we can hop on over into Edit Mode,

93
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:01,533
and I'm going to go to Face Select.

94
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:05,533
Now another way, as you can see here, that you can do this is Control

95
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:09,533
and Tab. It gives you a pop-up, wherever you are

96
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:13,533
in the 3D Editor, to select what you want to do. So in this case, Face

97
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:17,533
and I'm going to select this top face. Now I'm going to inset

98
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:21,533
it by pressing the I key. Now remembering that

99
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:25,533
this is the number that it's going in by is

100
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:29,533
proportioned to the actual size of the face, so I want each step to

101
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:33,533
be 1, and I've gone out by 10, so I need 10%

102
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:37,533
or 0.1. So I'm just going to type in

103
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:41,533
0.1, and we can see along the bottom that the Thickness is set

104
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,533
to 0.1. And I'm just going to press Enter, at that point,

105
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:49,533
and there we go, we've inset. And now we can extrude that face

106
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:53,533
upwards, so I'm going to press the E key to extrude.

107
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:57,533
It already seems to be locked in the Z axis, and I can press 1

108
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:01,533
and press Enter. So there we go, there's our

109
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:05,533
first step. And we're going to have to repeat that, a couple of times, to get our steps in

110
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:09,533
place. So I'm going to do that now, so I'm going to go Inset

111
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:13,533
by 0.1, extrude, and we can see the blue

112
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,533
Z axis is highlighted, so I can just hit 1. I,

113
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:21,533
0.1, E, 1. So this

114
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:25,533
is quite a quick way of getting our pyramid

115
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:29,533
shape built up, by just using the keyboard. I'm not even

116
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,533
touching the mouse, at the moment. Of course, you could go through and...

117
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:37,533
Oh, I've gone out of sync there! You could go through

118
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:41,533
and use the normal commands with all the buttons on the

119
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:45,533
side, if you wanted to. I do like using keyboard shortcuts

120
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:49,533
where possible, because they tend to be very powerful,

121
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:53,533
and I have gone into automation mode now, so I have no idea

122
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:57,533
if I've done 7 or it has to be at least 7, I think I said. So

123
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:01,533
there we go! So we've got the final box on top, so there's a nice Mayan

124
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:05,533
pyramid there. And I'm actually

125
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:09,533
going to move this bottom face, also up by 1.

126
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:13,533
So I'm just going to grab it and move it up,

127
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:17,533
but I want it to be a bit more precise. So grab

128
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:21,533
by 1 and we can see it's traveling by 1 in the lower-

129
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:25,533
left, and press the Z key, to make sure it's going in the Z

130
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:29,533
axis and I want press Enter. So now I can see that the base of

131
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:33,533
this pyramid is actually on the X, Y plane,

132
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:37,533
so it is on what we call like the ground. So the final bit here

133
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:41,533
is this little bit of square stuff at the top.

134
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:45,533
I haven't a clue how wide that is, probably 3 or 4.

135
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:49,533
So if I extrude, and again the blue is already highlighted by

136
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:53,533
4, and just have a look. That just looks odd! It

137
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,533
looks too big, so I'm just going to bring it down

138
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:01,533
to there. So I'm just doing that by eye. So

139
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:05,533
there we go, we've got our basic pyramid! You, of course, could go in and

140
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:09,533
create some steps if you wanted to, and make this a much more fleshed out

141
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:13,533
pyramid, using the previous knowledge that we've got. Otherwise,

142
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:17,533
there we go, we've got our Mayan pyramid using the Inset Tool!

143
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,833
Take care! See you in the next lecture!
