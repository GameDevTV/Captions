Welcome to Extruding

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:05.766
in Blender! In this video we'll go over what extruding

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:09.766
is, how you can go about planning your

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:13.766
model, and how it applies differently to faces,

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.766
edges, and vertices. So let's hop over

6
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.766
into a new Blender file! So whenever

7
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:25.766
we're extruding, we're going to want to be in Edit Mode,

8
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:29.766
and extruding is taking either an edge,

9
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:33.766
a face, or a vertex and creating

10
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.766
new geometry from it. So let's start with

11
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.766
a face! Go on to Face Select and select one of the

12
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:45.766
faces. Now we've already experienced what happens when you

13
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:49.766
scale it, so we could grab this whole cube and scale it

14
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:53.766
up or scale it so it's tall in the Z axis. But in this case,

15
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.766
what we can do is go down to Mesh

16
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.766
and go to Extrude, and we've got Region and we can see

17
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:05.766
it's go the shortcut key E. And when you do that it

18
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.766
creates a new face, joined with some other faces.

19
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:13.766
I haven't made that exactly a cube, although it's probably not far from it.

20
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:17.766
And then, if we click this face here, we can press

21
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:21.766
E or go to Mesh and Extrude, and we can extrude out this

22
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:25.766
way. See you can very quickly build up a model

23
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:29.766
of whatever you like, by just extruding.

24
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:33.766
And there we go, we've got some funky block work going on, perhaps

25
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:37.766
a 3D Tetris piece.

26
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:41.766
So how does it effect with edges? So we've seen verts when you extrude

27
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:45.766
a face, it creates a 3D

28
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:49.766
object of sorts. Now if we go and select an Edge,

29
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.766
and let's say we want to extrude this edge, you will notice it just generates

30
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:57.766
a single face. And we can lock it using a

31
00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:01.766
modifier key, like the Y key in this case,

32
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:05.766
in order to lock it into a certain place.

33
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:09.766
Then there we go, we've got something that can't exist in real life, because it's

34
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:13.766
just a single face, it's got no thickness,

35
00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.766
but it's great for building up our model, because then we can then

36
00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:21.766
click on this face. So we go to Face Select and click on that

37
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:25.766
face and then extrude upwards.

38
00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:29.766
You see that it's exactly the same

39
00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:33.766
height as that but in a new position. And we can see by the

40
00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:37.766
strange coloring thats going on that, that has in fact got

41
00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:41.766
its normals around the wrong way, so it definitely can't exist in real life.

42
00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:45.766
So in that case, I can select all of the faces, but in this case, I'm going to select the

43
00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:49.766
entire model. So I'm going to go to Select, Deselect Everything

44
00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:53.766
first, and then, Select, and Select everything, and then just go to Mesh,

45
00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:57.766
Normals, and Recalculate to the Outside or

46
00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:01.766
press Control and N. And that sorted out the normals on that.

47
00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:05.766
How about the vertex? Right, with

48
00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:09.766
vertices and when you're extruding using

49
00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:13.766
the vertices, it's locked to the angle of which you're

50
00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:17.766
currently viewing. Now to make that abundantly

51
00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:21.766
clear, we're currently looking down at this kind of 45 degree angle onto our

52
00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:25.766
model. If I select this vertex here and

53
00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:29.766
press the E key or go to Extrude, Vertices

54
00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:33.766
Only, you see that we've got this

55
00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:37.766
vertex that we can place anywhere we like and it's

56
00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:41.766
going to create an edge. And we can carry on doing that to our

57
00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:45.766
hearts content, here, here, here, and you can make

58
00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:49.766
anything you'd like. And of course, at some point, you'll want to close your

59
00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:53.766
geometry. At the moment, this is all loose even though all

60
00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:57.766
of these are connected to one another, it doesn't make anything other than

61
00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:01.766
a series of edges. So we can create one more

62
00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:05.766
and place it roughly next to our vertex that

63
00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:09.766
we've had before, select the other vertex, and then,

64
00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:13.766
Remove our Doubles. And has that

65
00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:17.766
removed? We can see it's removed no vertices. I'm just going to increase the merge distance,

66
00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:21.766
and that's closed that now. So that's one

67
00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:25.766
vertex there, so it's linked back in. Now, if I

68
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:29.766
move the model around, you'll see that that whole series of

69
00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:33.766
edges that we've created and vertices exist where I was

70
00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:37.766
looking down on it. So if you wanted more control over that, you'd probably

71
00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:41.766
lock your model in Orthographic Projection

72
00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:45.766
to the side, and then, you could take an edge here,

73
00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:49.766
make a pointy shape, if you wanted to, and I'm going to

74
00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:53.766
join it back down here. I'm going to select the other vertex,

75
00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:57.766
Remove Doubles, and that's brought the two together.

76
00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:01.766
And as you can see, that's actually on

77
00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:05.766
this plane here, the Z, Y plane,

78
00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:09.766
so you can see it's straight down that edge. This

79
00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.766
one is a bit ambiguous, it's just being created

80
00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.100
in a random

81
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.433
place in space.

82
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.933
So you can see, by using this method, you can

83
00:05:21.933 --> 00:05:25.933
very quickly block out a model shape

84
00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:29.933
that you want. Now I haven't been particularly clear with what I'm doing here.

85
00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:33.933
Oh, how about that! So because the

86
00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:37.933
normals were the wrong way around, when we created... I'm just going to switch back into

87
00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:41.933
Perspective Mode. Because the normals were the wrong way around on the

88
00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:45.933
face that we created here, when we extruded an edge,

89
00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:49.933
you can see it's kind of created a box. Now we'll want to

90
00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.933
fill that face in, unless we want the box shape. In this

91
00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:57.933
case we don't, so we'll need to go to Edge Select, select

92
00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:01.933
these edges here, and

93
00:06:01.933 --> 00:06:05.933
finally, we need to fill that in. So we can go to Mesh,

94
00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:09.933
Faces, Make an Edge or Face, and click F.

95
00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:13.933
So there we go, that's now a solid object again!

96
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.300
It's challenge time! OK, I'd like you to create a

97
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.300
block plane, as in an airplane! Now I

98
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.300
would like you, if you're unfamiliar with an airplane, to go look at some planes.

99
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.300
Wooden toys do make a great reference material for this

100
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.300
type of modeling, and, of course, once you've made it share the creation

101
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.100
in the discussions.

102
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.400
So let's hop on over into Blender! Here

103
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.400
we have the basic startup file in front of us, and the

104
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.400
first thing I'm going to do is hop on over into Edit Mode.

105
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.400
Now I'm going to select the front face,

106
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.400
and I'm going to use these arrows as reference.

107
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.400
So I want the front of the plane,

108
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.400
where this green arrow is here, and the rear on

109
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.400
the other side. So I've pressed E to extrude

110
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.400
and that's going to be the nose of my plane.

111
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.400
Now, each time I extrude, I'm going to want to

112
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.400
think about what is going in that area. So those are roughly

113
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.400
the middle of the fuselage and wings, then we're going to have a bit of body,

114
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.400
and then, we're going to have the tail plane and

115
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.400
the fin things at the back. OK, so let's start

116
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.400
shaping our model! We'll worry about the wings and things like that

117
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.400
in a moment. We want this to be a pointy cone, so I'm going to select the front

118
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.366
end.

119
00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:43.433
I want to scale that down to

120
00:07:43.433 --> 00:07:47.433
nothing. So I pressed S and I could keep going until I'm roughly there, or I could just

121
00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:51.433
hit the 0 key, which will scale it to a point.

122
00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:55.433
OK these two here, I want to

123
00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:59.433
raise up to make the cockpit. So I'm going to click on that one

124
00:07:59.433 --> 00:08:03.433
and this one here, and I'm going to extrude

125
00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:07.433
up, I don't know by how much. That should do!

126
00:08:07.433 --> 00:08:11.433
Finally, these last two we'll make the tail plane

127
00:08:11.433 --> 00:08:15.433
from, or rather this one here. So we'll extrude that

128
00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:19.433
up as well to roughly there, so it's eye level,

129
00:08:19.433 --> 00:08:23.433
and then, we're going to have a wing here and

130
00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:27.433
a wing on the other side. Now there is a way of

131
00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:29.600
mirroring, but we're not going to do that, at the moment, we're just going to extrude

132
00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:34.133
that out. So we're going to hit the E key to extrude

133
00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:38.133
and I've started moving it in that direction, and looking down in the

134
00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:42.133
lower corner, I think 5 and 1/2 to 6 is going to be what we want.

135
00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:46.133
I'm going to go for 5, so I'm just going to press the number 5, and I'm going to go

136
00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:50.133
around to the other side, select that face, press E, move this way,

137
00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:54.133
and again by 5.

138
00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:58.133
And there we go! This one here is going to be much less, so let's extrude that

139
00:08:58.133 --> 00:09:02.133
out, probably about there, which is about 2.

140
00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:06.133
And the same here, extrude this way by 2.

141
00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:10.133
Now you can use the numbers across the top of the keyboard. I'm

142
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:14.133
just using my number pad, since it's easier to reach.

143
00:09:14.133 --> 00:09:18.133
So now we need to tidy this lot up. So we're

144
00:09:18.133 --> 00:09:22.133
going to bring some of these together. So I'm going to bring this

145
00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:26.133
edge along with this edge, straight away.

146
00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:30.133
So I'm just going to move it back, until they're almost

147
00:09:30.133 --> 00:09:34.133
on top of one another, and then, I'm going to select the other edge,

148
00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:38.133
go down, and Remove Doubles. And I'm

149
00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:42.133
going to increase the Merge Distance enough, so that they snap together.

150
00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:46.133
And I see at the top here, we've removed 2 vertices.

151
00:09:46.133 --> 00:09:50.133
And I'm going to do the same now for this edge and this edge.

152
00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:54.133
So I'm going to move that in till it's almost over the top,

153
00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:58.133
select the other one, and remove doubles.

154
00:09:58.133 --> 00:10:02.133
Now, I'm going to want to do a similar thing

155
00:10:02.133 --> 00:10:06.133
to this wing, so I'm going to do that now.

156
00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:10.133
Oh, there's another way you could do that! So we could merge these two together, or

157
00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:14.133
once again, you could select the face here

158
00:10:14.133 --> 00:10:18.133
and then scale it, but this time constrain it so it's

159
00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:22.133
only on the Z axis. So I'm going to hit the Z key

160
00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:26.133
and you can see it's getting smaller and bigger that way, and I'm going to

161
00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:28.933
constrain it down to 0.

162
00:10:28.933 --> 00:10:32.933
But bear in mind that these two edges, that have now been

163
00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:36.933
scaled together, still exist on top of one another. So if you were

164
00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:40.933
to do any work on it, let's select that edge now,

165
00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:44.933
we can still see that we can lift it up or indeed through one another, so they're not

166
00:10:44.933 --> 00:10:48.933
merged yet. So let's just undo that!

167
00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:52.933
So to merge those two again, because they were on top of one another, we'll need to hop into

168
00:10:52.933 --> 00:10:56.933
Wireframe Mode, select the other edge as well, scroll down

169
00:10:56.933 --> 00:11:00.933
here, Remove Doubles. And we can see we've removed 2 vertices

170
00:11:00.933 --> 00:11:04.933
which make up the edge there, so we've only got 2 left. I'd

171
00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:08.933
recommend, when you've finished your model, just selecting

172
00:11:08.933 --> 00:11:12.933
everything, and then, anything that's right next to one another,

173
00:11:12.933 --> 00:11:16.933
if we click Remove Doubles, the Merge Distance is low. We can already see we've

174
00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:20.933
created a duplicate 8 vertices there.

175
00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:24.933
So it's always a good tip, as you're going through, if you think you've put one thing on top

176
00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:28.933
of another, and you do want them to merge into one, then

177
00:11:28.933 --> 00:11:32.333
remember to Remove Doubles, either as you go or towards the end.

178
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.800
So I'm just going to

179
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.800
rotate around the model now, to the other side of the plane,

180
00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:42.700
and I'm going to do the same on this one. So I'm going to scale,

181
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.266
which you can select up here of course,

182
00:11:45.566 --> 00:11:48.800
on the Z axis down to 0.

183
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.800
Now I can do the same thing for here and here.

184
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.800
We can select them all at once, if we were astute enough to remember

185
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.800
what we were doing. Again, scale in the

186
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.800
Z axis, down to 0.

187
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.800
Here we're going to scale in the Y axis, by the looks of things,

188
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.800
or maybe the X, X axis down to 0. So scale

189
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.800
in the X axis, all the way down to 0.

190
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.800
I'm not sure whether

191
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.800
we can select this edge and scale it down to 0 as well, that would be very

192
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.800
quick and simple if we could. Perfect!

193
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.800
So there we have our rudimentary plane! Now you can go around and

194
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.800
tidy some of this up, but that's pretty much the work

195
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.133
flow for doing block modeling.

196
00:12:40.133 --> 00:12:44.033
How did you guys get on? What did you come up with? You can

197
00:12:44.033 --> 00:12:48.033
spend a lot more time adding a lot of detail to this model! I'd love to see

198
00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:52.033
what you came up with! See you in the next lecture!
