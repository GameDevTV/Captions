00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to Moving, Rotating, and Resizing!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video we're going to show you how to control your model with more

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
precision. We'll go over Blender's coordinate system.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And just a reminder for those who know and for those new-

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
comers to the 3D world, coordinates are always listed in the

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
order (X, Y, Z).

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Always in that order, so if you ever see a series of numbers with commas in between them

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
like that, we're talking about the X coordinate, the

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Y coordinate, and the Z coordinate. Let's hop over

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
into Blender.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.033
So here we are in Blender with our wedge

12
00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:44.533
and I'm now in Object Mode as well.

13
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.800
The first thing I'd just like to do is draw your

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800
attention to our 3D Manipulator Widget, with

15
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.800
it's orange blob in the middle. Now that orange blob is

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
called the Origin. Now, at some point, during the construction

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.800
of my wedge the Origin has ended up outside of our model,

18
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.800
and that, in this case, I don't want that to happen.

19
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.800
So I want you to go over to your Tool Shelf, if that has happened to you,

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.800
where it says Set Origin under the Tools Options

21
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.800
I'd like you to change that and set the Geometry

22
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.800
to the Origin or the Origin to Geometry. One move is the object, one

23
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.800
move is the Origin, but essentially you'll end

24
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.800
up with your Origin back in the middle. Right,

25
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.800
so I'd like you to put away your Tool Shelf, for the moment,

26
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.800
and bring open your Properties.

27
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.800
Now, I'm just going to scroll up here, so we can see our Transform options.

28
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.800
Incidentally, if you're not seeing that you may

29
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.800
still be in Edit Mode. If you're in Edit Mode, it

30
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.800
gives you a different set of options. In this case, you want to be

31
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.800
in Object Mode. So we've got Location,

32
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.800
Rotation, and Scale. Ideal, that's exactly what we want to play with!

33
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800
Now the location is the location of that little orange blob there,

34
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.800
so if we set it to 0, 0, and 0,

35
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.800
surprise surprise the wedge itself or

36
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
the orange blob, the bang of the middle, sits where X, Y, and

37
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.800
Z all equal 0. And you can tell which way it

38
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.800
is positive and which way is negative, simply by the direction of

39
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.800
that arrow. So if for some reason you had your model upside-

40
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.800
down, like this, you could still see which way was positive and which

41
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.800
way was negative. I'm just going to flip the model back over. Wow,

42
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800
not feeling too dizzy there! So with this we can control

43
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.800
our model precisely, so we can say I want the Origin

44
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.800
to be at X is 1. And we can see it's moved it along by 1,

45
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.800
and Y equals 4 and it will shift it towards us

46
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.800
that way by 4. Now the Rotation

47
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.800
is very similar, we've got X, Y, and Z rotation.

48
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.800
The Z rotation would be, if you imagine, a skewer

49
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.800
going through our object where that blue arrow is. If

50
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.800
we play with the Z, you can see it spins around

51
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
as if someone had literally poked a skewer through the Z axis.

52
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.800
Now finally, we've got our Scaling options

53
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.800
here, so we can scale things individually. Now

54
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800
the great thing about this is, it scales the actual model itself.

55
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.800
So it's not relative to these X, Y, and

56
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.800
Z's anymore, so it remembers how we created

57
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.800
the model in the first place. So if we scale it on the X axis,

58
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.800
it will actually get narrower and wider.

59
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.800
If we scale it on Z, it will get taller and narrower,

60
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.800
and of course, we can actually input the values

61
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.800
we want in here, so it's precise. And if you need to set it to a

62
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.800
certain dimension, you can do so. Here we can say X

63
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.800
equals to 1, so that would make the width of that,

64
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.800
in this case, 1 Blender unit. I could set the Y,

65
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.800
that is the length, to 4. So now that is a 1 in 4

66
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.800
wedge, and finally the Z, I could set that to 1 again

67
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.800
and we end up with a much more sensible sized wedge.

68
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.800
Now that is still a pretty big wedge being a meter tall but there we go,

69
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.800
and that changes the scale

70
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.800
accordingly. So if we change this to

71
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.800
2, we'll see that the scale as also changed from our original

72
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.800
model, but the dimensions have allowed us to make the wedge

73
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.800
in exact scale on the X, Y, and Z

74
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.800
axes. I feel a challenge coming on!

75
00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:54.866
What I'd like you to do is grab your wedge and

76
00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:58.866
move it to an exact location. So I'd like you to rotate

77
00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:02.866
the wedge, so the pointy end is facing up. Make

78
00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:06.866
it half the size it was before, and make sure the Origin

79
00:05:06.866 --> 00:05:10.866
is placed at (0, 4,

80
00:05:10.866 --> 00:05:14.866
2). So pause the video now and go try

81
00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:18.866
doing that! OK

82
00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:22.866
welcome back! Let's hop straight back over to Blender and do our

83
00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:24.133
challenge!

84
00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:28.200
I will want, if I imagine a

85
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.200
skewer going through my model... In fact, I'm going to just

86
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.200
set it so that the Rotation is 0 on Z as well, so we

87
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.200
can imagine things a bit better. So I want to move that so the pointy end is facing

88
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.200
up. So I'm imagining a skewer going through it, it would go through

89
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.200
the X axis. So I need to go to X and I want to

90
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.200
rotate it 90 degrees, and there we go, our

91
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.200
pointy end is facing up. Now we wanted the

92
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.200
location to be (0, 4, 2). So here

93
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.200
we can go 0. We've already got it set to 4, fortunately,

94
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.200
and here we can have it set to 2.

95
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.200
There we go, it's set at the right location! And finally the Scale!

96
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.200
So back to our original Scale, this would be

97
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.200
0.5 to make it half the size, 0.5 here, and

98
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.200
again 0.5 there. So now our wedge is

99
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.200
set at the right coordinates. Let's just check! (0,

100
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.200
4, 2). Yep, it's half the size it was before in

101
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.200
all dimensions, yep! And finally,

102
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.200
Rotating the wedge so the pointy end is facing up!

103
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.200
There we go excellent! So that's exactly positioned where

104
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.200
we wanted it! How did you guys get on? I'd like you to post your

105
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.200
results in the discussion against this lecture, and I'll see you in

106
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.266
the next one! Take care!
