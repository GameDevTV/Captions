Hi guys, welcome to Version Control! In this video

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we're going to talk about what Version Control is, why you would

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
want to do this, and how to change Blender's Save Versions,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and finally look at some of the other options that we have.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So let's hop straight over into Blender! And we've got our wedge in front

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
of us. Now, at the moment, I hope you have been

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
saving as you've been going along, but as you've been saving, Blender's

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
default is to just save one prior save, one version

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
previous. Now I know that the task coming up,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
for what we're about to start doing to this periscope,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
will actually be almost unrecoverable. I know we're about to

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
make some fundamental changes to that mesh. Now, it is

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
important that if you are about to try something

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
with your model that you don't mess it up,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that you can always get back to this deviation point that you're

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
about to do. So first of all, let's explore Blender's

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
system. So if we go up to File

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and go to your User Preferences, underneath the File

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
tab we have Save Versions.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now you'll notice mine is set to 0, that's because I use a different way of

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
keeping track of all the changes I make. However,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
you may want to set that to something like 5,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
maybe even a few more, not too many more. And the

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
reason for that is, it's difficult to

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
distinguish basically what the versions are. You basically get your

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
name.blend 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. depending

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
on how many versions you have. They're not very descriptive

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
unfortunately, so you can end up being in a position where you're not quite

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
sure how far you have to go back, so that's a good reason not to have too

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
many of those. So I would recommend that perhaps you set that to

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
3, 4, maybe even 5 but no more than that,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
because it will be a mess to try and get back to.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The other option for you... I'm just going to set that back to 0 for myself.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The other option for you is to be more descriptive. You're about

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to make a change to your model, you're not sure if it's going to work or not, but you want

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
to try it, so you can always go to File and

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Save As. Now you can see here

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that's where I started, Vertices, Edges and Faces (Start File)

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
.blend. Well I could change that

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
where it says (Start File), I could now change that to saying

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
something like... What are we talking about? We're talking about

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Version Control, so (VersionControl). I haven't

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
actually changed anything of my model, but when I click Save As Blender File, I now have

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
a new start point to go on. And if I muck

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
up this periscope, whatever I'm going to do to it next, then at

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
least I can fall back to the previous save point, rather than

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
worrying about what's going on or how do I get back to this model!

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Obviously this periscope's a very simple model, it's only taken us a few minutes to get here.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
However, if it was a much more complicated model, the last thing

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you'd want to do is lose a ton of work because you didn't have a

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
version you could jump back to. It's all very well saving as you're going

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but you do need to branch sometimes, to make sure you can always get

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,800
back when you start to experiment.

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,933
What other options are there out there? Well,

55
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:37,933
for instance, you could use Dropbox. I

56
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:41,933
use Dropbox for many things, and the great thing about

57
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:45,933
it is it keeps versions, as long as they've synced, it

58
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:49,933
keeps versions of your files for up to 30 days. So if you're working

59
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:53,933
on a project, you can extend that with their extra packages, but

60
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,933
if you're working within the 30 day time frame, you can always go back

61
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:01,933
in time 30 days. After that, those version changes start to be deleted,

62
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:05,933
but for most models, you may find that is enough to keep

63
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:09,933
you protected. So there are a couple of ways that you can

64
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:13,933
keep your versions, the versions of your models, under your

65
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:17,933
control and not having them wonder off on you. Take care!

66
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:21,733
See you in the next lecture!
