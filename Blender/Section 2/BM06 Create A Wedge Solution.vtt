Hi guys, welcome back to Creating a Wedge and the Solution

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to it! So let's hop straight into Blender now and show you what

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.066
you need to do!

4
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:14.066
Let's go ahead and make that wedge! So I'm going to

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:18.066
start by just deleting what we have here. There are a couple of ways to do it.

6
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:22.066
Now I could select everything down here, Select, Select All,

7
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.066
and that also is Deselect, so it toggles Selection and Deselect.

8
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:30.066
That's with the A key if you want. Alternatively, if you

9
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:34.066
are in Object Mode you could have the model already selected,

10
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:38.066
and then, of course, hit the X key

11
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:42.066
to Delete and this little prompt comes up,

12
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:46.066
and then we can click on Delete. So I want

13
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:50.066
to add a Cube as a starting point, because that's the closest

14
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.066
thing to our wedge. I'm just going to

15
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:58.066
shift that up just a little so it's above this plane.

16
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:02.066
Now how do I make a wedge? Well essentially I'm going to be slicing that in two,

17
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.066
so along this diagonal. So I need to hop into Edit

18
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.066
Mode, I'm going to select this edge here

19
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.066
because I know we need to get rid of that,

20
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:18.066
and hit X and Delete Edges.

21
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.433
These two as well.

22
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.100
There we go! And we could have done that by

23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.100
selecting the vertices or the faces or whatever. You

24
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.100
could have done it in any number of ways, that's fine! So

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.100
here we want to create a face. Now a face is essentially going to be at least

26
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.100
three points, so we could just select all

27
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.100
three vertices and press F. If we wanted to,

28
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.100
we could have Edge Select turned on and select these two edges and press

29
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.100
F. And finally, we've got this area

30
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.100
here. So we'll want to select the four edges

31
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.100
or four vertices, but these are currently selected

32
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.100
so we'll want to deselect those OK. Now if we press

33
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.100
F it fills that in! That's a nice wedge

34
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.100
but I do want it a bit more natural, so I want to stretch it out.

35
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.100
I want to stretch it out along here. So if we go

36
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100
and select this front edge only and

37
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.100
pull that this way, we get ourselves a much more natural shaped

38
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.100
wedge. I'm quite happy with that! How did you

39
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.566
guys get on!?!
