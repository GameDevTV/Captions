1
00:00:00,466 --> 00:00:04,000
Vertices, Edges, and Faces!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video we're going to learn about Object Mode and Edit

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mode, naming your meshes, manipulating

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
vertices, edges, and faces, and understanding

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
their relationship to one another. So let's head straight

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
on over into Blender!

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,433
We've opened up a brand new Blender file. The first thing I'm

8
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,433
going to do is just move that cube up a little. We're going to be working

9
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:34,433
with this cube, so I'm just wanting to make sure it's above

10
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:38,433
this plane here. OK, so Object

11
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:42,433
Mode and Edit Mode, what's the deal there?

12
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:46,433
Well this cube is an object,

13
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:50,433
so is this camera, and so is this lamp.

14
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:54,433
If we have a look on the right-hand side here, I'm just going

15
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:58,433
to expand the Outliner. So this Editor here is

16
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,433
called the Outliner, and it lists here the

17
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:06,433
objects in our world. Now if we have a

18
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,433
look at the Cube, we see it has this

19
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:14,433
triangle next to it, and that triangle means that this cube is a

20
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:18,433
mesh. Now currently the Lamp is selected.

21
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:22,433
If we go down to the 3D Header Bar and

22
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:26,433
click on Object Mode, we can see there's nothing else to do. However,

23
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:30,433
if we select the Cube, either in the Outliner or in the

24
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:34,433
3D Editor itself, we then get some more options.

25
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:38,433
At the moment, we only want Edit Mode. If we click

26
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:42,433
on Edit Mode, it goes into that mesh and

27
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:44,966
enables us to Edit it. Finally,

28
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:49,733
you can toggle between Edit Mode and Object Mode,

29
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:53,733
using the Tab key.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
With only three objects in our world, at the moment, it's

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,866
quite easy to distinguish

32
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:03,600
them from one another, however, as you build

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,600
more and more complex meshes, you'll want to name them to make sure

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,600
you can find them again, select them, and manipulate them.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
So if we have a look on the right-hand side, we can

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,600
see that our mesh is called Cube. That's an accurate description

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
of what it is on the screen. You can also see the name of that mesh,

38
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,800
if I enable the Properties

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Pane in the 3D Editor or press the N key. um, Mid-

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,800
way down on here there is, here we go, under the Item

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
dropdown you see it says Cube. So you can either change the name

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
here in the Outliner or in the Properties Pane

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
of the 3D Editor itself. So if we change that one here to

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Cube1

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
we can see it changes in two places. I couldn't think

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
of a better name for it. So that's how you name

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
your meshes. Let's go and edit that Cube

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,066
and make it into something else.

49
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:10,066
So I'm just going to do a bit of tidying up, because I'm

50
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:14,066
quite lacking space here. Right let's

51
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:18,066
zoom into this cube, so we can have a closer look!

52
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,066
So on the 3D Header Bar

53
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:26,066
you have three buttons next to one another, Vertex Select,

54
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:30,066
Edge Select, and Face Select. Now when

55
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:34,066
Vertex Select is selected, we're able to select

56
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:38,066
each one of these vertices individually. The same is

57
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:42,066
true when Edge Select is, we can select all the edges,

58
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:46,066
and finally faces, you've guessed it, you can select

59
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:50,066
faces! Now the really cool thing about this is, if I select a face, like this one

60
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:54,066
on top, and then click Edge Select, it changes now

61
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:58,066
to selecting all of the edges that made up that face. And

62
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:02,066
similarly, if I now click on Vertex Select, we've now selected all the

63
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:06,066
vertices that make up those edges, which make up that face.

64
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:10,066
Now we can start manipulating our model!

65
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:14,066
So how do we do that? Well over here,

66
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:18,066
on the left-hand side, we have some options,

67
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:22,066
Translate, and if we hover over...

68
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:26,066
Ooh I'm already doing it, I'm just going to escape out of that. With Translate,

69
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:30,066
if we hover over it, you can see it's got the shortcut G. Rotate

70
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:34,066
has the shortcut R, Scale has the shortcut

71
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,066
S, etc. So if you ever want to know what a shortcut

72
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:42,066
key is, and it's not apparent straight away, if you hover over any of these

73
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:46,066
buttons, if there is a shortcut you can see what it is.

74
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:50,066
So now, if I press G I can move all of those vertices up

75
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:54,066
and down, or indeed, we're moving that face at the same

76
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:58,066
time, it's the same thing. If we press the R key to rotate,

77
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:02,066
we can rotate that face around. At the moment, it's

78
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:06,066
around an arbitrary point in space, and scale

79
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:10,066
with S, we can make the top much much smaller.

80
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:14,066
Excellent! So we've got some sort of funky pyramid going on there!

81
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:18,066
Now what happens if we don't want that shape, if we want to actually

82
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:22,066
edit the shape itself? Well we can start going in and deleting

83
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:26,066
stuff. So let's select edge, click this

84
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:30,066
edge, and then go to the menu Mesh,

85
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:34,066
and we can see Delete and we've got an X there, so we can hit

86
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:38,066
X and select Edges. Now that's deleted that

87
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:42,066
edge there. Now because these two faces

88
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:46,066
relied on the edge existing, it's now

89
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:50,066
gone. So with this we could make a brand new

90
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:54,066
shape. Let's delete this vertex down

91
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:58,066
here. I'm going to press X and delete the vertices.

92
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,066
Now I'm going to join up

93
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:06,066
this vertex here and this one here, by holding down Shift,

94
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:10,066
while selecting. I'm going to go to Mesh,

95
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:14,066
Edges, Make Edge or

96
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:18,066
Face, and it's got the shortcut key F.

97
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:22,066
So that has made an edge there. If I now

98
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:26,066
highlight these two vertices and press F,

99
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:30,066
it will make an edge there, and if I highlight these two

100
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:34,066
and press F but there's no faces left.

101
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:38,066
Well we can simply select the third.

102
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:42,066
Remember a face must exist of at least three

103
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:46,066
vertices and three edges.

104
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:50,066
And press F, it actually fills that space in with a

105
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:54,066
face. I would do it there

106
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:58,066
and we'll do it here as well.

107
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:02,066
So there we go, we've filled in all of those. Ah no,

108
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:06,066
we haven't, we've forgotten the bottom!

109
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:10,066
There we go, so we've now got a completely solid

110
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:13,700
and new shape from our cube!

111
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,533
It's challenge time! I'd like you to create a wedge!

112
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:21,533
So starting with a cube, create a wedge. Make

113
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:25,533
sure you name your mesh Wedge, and finally,

114
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:29,533
it should look something like that.

115
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,533
Variations on the theme are accepted. So pause the video now, go off,

116
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:37,533
and try and make your first wedge!

117
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:41,533
Welcome back! How did you get on? Well in

118
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:45,533
the next lecture, we'll show you the process for making that wedge!
