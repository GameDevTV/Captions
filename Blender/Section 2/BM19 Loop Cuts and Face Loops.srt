Welcome to Loop Cuts and Face Loops! In

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
this video you're going to build on your knowledge of loop cuttings and

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
how face loops are similar to edge loops.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's hop over into Blender! So we have

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
our Pyramid that we've been playing with. Let's go in

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and add some more detail to this top section.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's hop on over into Edit Mode and let's

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
zoom in here. Now when you hold down Control and R you

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
enable your Loop Cutting Tool. Now, before we

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
click to actually apply that cut, we can

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
use the Scroll Wheel on our mouse, in order

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to increase the number of cuts. And that can go up and up

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and up and up and up, and we can see in the lower-left that that's 35 cuts

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
there. That's a bit too much for this exercise,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so we're going to lower that down to maybe 3

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or 4. I like 5 actually,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in this case. I'm just thinking of what I'm going to do later on.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then, you've got the slide function, once again.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now there's plenty of stuff you can do this with, and I want to actually

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
push this up a little higher anyway. So I've got

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
a nice set of geometry. And this has created a series of edge loops around

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
our model and has cut up our top of this model into

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
several more faces, adding more geometry.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And the more geometry we have, the more control we have

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
over our model, the more detailed we can make it. So

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
at this point, I want to select all of these edges going around,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
so I can bulge it out or move it in or do whatever I want with it.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So making sure that the Face Select is on,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
again holding down Alt will enable you

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to select an edge, sorry, a face loop, just like it does

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
with an edge loop. And if we click towards the

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
edge, the left or right edge, it will go around the...

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's call it a cube for the moment, it's not quite. Go around the top this way.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If we click towards the top, then it will

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
follow...it'll follow our model around there.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So that's great, we can alter things very quickly. And similarly, if we want

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
to alter the height of one of these steps here, we can select

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
a edge loop towards the edge.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There we go, got it! And now we can do whatever we want, we can pull that

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
edge loop up and make it some sort of funky hidden thing. We need

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to fill in some geometry, if we did do that. Ah but you can see how

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
powerful that would be. So I'm just going to undo that, so our pyramid's

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,633
not too crazy, so you guys can follow.

44
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,600
It's challenge time! I'd like you to create some temple

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
detail. So to create some extra geometry at the top of the

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
pyramid, that little square bit at the top, and modify that geometry to

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
make it a bit more exciting. I'm going to leave what you want to do

48
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
to what you want to do. All that I do ask is that you don't make it too

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,600
exciting around the top of the stairs, because shortly we'll

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,600
be creating a door into our temple, and if it's too exciting

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,600
around there, it's going to be more difficult to make the door. But go

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,600
wild with it, make it as crazy or as pointy or as large or small as you like.

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Go for it! Pause the video now and give that a go!

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop over

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
into Blender! Let's see what we can do to the top. So I've

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
already put lots of cuts in there, that's great. Um, I'm going to

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Face Select and I'm going to hold down Alt and select this top ring here.

58
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
And I want to... I suppose it's scaling it out but

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
not up and down, so I

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,600
want to limit the Z. So we want to eliminate that by holding down

61
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Shift and Z and pull that out. Now that seems to

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
be, that's not quite what I want because I still want that lip at the very top,

63
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,600
so I'm going to have to do something else first. So I'm going to

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
extrude into the same location. So I'm just going to hit

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
0 to make sure it stays in the same location, and that has generated an

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
edge. We won't see it at the moment, because they're on top of one another.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
And now when we scale outwards, we've actually got

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
some extra geometry that prevents the top... I've zoomed in far

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
too far. Sorry guys! Let's scale that out again.

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I've created an extra bit of geometry, which means that it's not going to bend

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,600
the rest of it as we scale out. So I'm happy with that! And let's do

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
just another one around here,

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,600
but this time I will bend it, so we'll do it slightly differently.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
So let's scale this again... Oh uh oh, zoom out!

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
It's gone a bit crazy there isn't it?! So let's scale that

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
but this time I do want the bulge, but I don't want it over where I'm going to put the...

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Ah no that's fine where the door is there. And I want to snap it, in this case,

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
so it's level with the roof line. So that's absolutely

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
fine. I'm going to have to pick a different snapping point, a Face snap.

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
So let's scale that out and draw along this face. No it's not

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
liking that! Let's try a Vertex Select and scale that

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
out, so it's on this edge there. So that was the best way of doing this,

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
so now they're the same width as one another but slightly different.

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Excellent! Ah final thing to do on this top here,

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I'm going to lift it up just a little more, so I'm going to extrude again,

86
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
and then, I'm going to scale inwards, so it's got a bit more of

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
a chamfered top. Excellent! That would to do for the moment, that's in

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
keeping with the rest of our model as well. How did you guys get on?!

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I really want to see what you made from the top of your temple! Post it in the

90
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
discussions, and I will see you in the next lecture! Take care!
