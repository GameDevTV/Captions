00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Normals in Blender! In this

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,933
video we're going to learn about normals,

3
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:10,933
why they're important, and how to fix them if they've gone wrong.

4
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's hop over into Blender!

5
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:18,266
So here we have the periscope, which we've reduced to 12 vertices,

6
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:22,266
and we're going to do something a little silly, we're going to

7
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:26,266
push it through itself. So with the Edge Select

8
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:30,266
Tool in Edit Mode, I'm going to select this top edge

9
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:34,266
and push it through itself at the back here.

10
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:38,266
Now you can see it's gone a bit of a funny color,

11
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:42,266
If we more around now. It's not quite rendering how it was

12
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:46,266
before. Now when it comes to your

13
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:50,266
normals, they are incredibly important. If we were to export this now

14
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:54,266
to another 3D package, it would not render

15
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:58,266
correctly. So I want to show you now how to show

16
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,266
your normals, so you can understand A which way they're

17
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:06,266
pointing and B how to correct them.

18
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:10,266
So over in the Properties Pane, if we scroll down there are

19
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:14,266
two sections that we're going to focus on. One is called Shading

20
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:18,266
and one is under Mesh Display, Normals. So

21
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:22,266
first of all, let's do the Mesh Display! Now there are several

22
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:26,266
types of normals but, in this case, we want Face Normals. So we're going to click

23
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:30,266
the Face icon there and we're just going to increase the size a little,

24
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:34,266
and that shows us which way our

25
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:38,266
Face Normals are facing. Now, for rendering

26
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:42,266
purposes, light will come in and it will strike a surface,

27
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:46,266
but if the normal isn't there, if it's facing the other way

28
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:50,266
like these ones are here, you end up with something like this.

29
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:54,266
So go up to Shading

30
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:58,266
and turn on Backface Culling. Now Blender's quite

31
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:02,266
cleaver, it just demonstrates the 3D model for you.

32
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:06,266
However, in most other programs you'll get a model that

33
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:10,266
kind of looks like this, with this weird

34
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:14,266
sort of display going on. It's all see through but only at certain angles,

35
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:18,266
and that just won't do, it would look absolutely silly when

36
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:22,266
it comes to exporting it into another package.

37
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:26,266
I'm just going to turn on this other one here, called Ambient Occlusion. It just

38
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:30,266
makes it, you know, highlights it just that much more. What's going on

39
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,266
here as we twirl around, it just looks, well it looks a mess

40
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:38,266
and it is a mess! So how do we go about sorting this

41
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:42,266
out? Well there are a couple of ways, so in this case,

42
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:46,266
we can pick Face Select whilst we're in Edit Mode,

43
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,266
we can click the face we're referring to, go to Mesh,

44
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:54,266
Faces, and Flip the Normal around.

45
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:58,266
Now that will enable us to... Well now the

46
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:02,266
normals are facing outwards, and we can do the same for all of

47
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,966
these faces.

48
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:07,700
So guys, I have a challenge for you!

49
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,433
In your assets

50
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,500
you will find a file called Normal_

51
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
<<<<<<< HEAD:Blender/Section 2/BM11b Normals in Blender.srt
Mes.blend. I'd like you to open up that file
=======
Mess.blend. I'd like you to open up that file
>>>>>>> 61fb7349cf669f249b4a9560c07cf0816c59420a:Blender/Section 2/BM11b Normals in Blender.srt

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,500
and set all of the normals to face outside.

53
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Go pause the video now and give that

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
a go!

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Welcome back! Let's show you how to fix the normal mess!

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500
So if we go and open up Normal_Mess...

57
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:41,233
So here we have the normal mess, and it looks

58
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:45,233
like we've got some patches. It's almost like a Rubik's Cube

59
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:49,233
going on here, and these patches have the

60
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:53,233
normals faced the wrong way. So we can just check that by opening up the Properties

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,233
Pane, going to Shading, and turning on Backface Culling,

62
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:01,233
and whoa! We've got some holes in our mesh and it looks horrible! So as

63
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:05,233
you can see, this is how it would import into

64
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:09,233
another package, and that's not what we want. So let's hop into Edit

65
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:13,233
Mode and see if we can solve this! So let's select the object

66
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:17,233
first, hop into Edit Mode, and there we

67
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:21,233
go! We can see... Oh, naughty naughty! I left

68
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:25,233
all of these faces selected. I better go edit that for you guys,

69
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:29,233
so [Laughs] you don't have so much of an easy job,

70
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:33,233
and so we could go along and we could select the faces

71
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:37,233
going into Mesh and going Flip Normals, to put them

72
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:41,233
right. And of course, you can hold down Shift, as you go through these,

73
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:45,233
and go Faces, Flip Normals. Ah the other

74
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:49,233
thing you can do is, you can select everything. So we can go down to Select

75
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:53,233
and go Select All.

76
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:57,233
If it doesn't do it the first time, it will deselect if anything else is selected.

77
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:01,233
And then, we can go to Mesh,

78
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:05,233
and along here, if I put my glasses

79
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,333
back on... There we go!

80
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,833
So Normals, here we go, Recalculate Outside!

81
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,833
That's the one we wanted, and that will flip them all so they're facing

82
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,833
outwards, out of the model. And finally, we can just

83
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,833
check that with one other check, and

84
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,833
if we scroll down here, we can turn Face Normals on and just extend the size

85
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,833
and we can see they're all now facing outwards.

86
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,833
How did you guys get on? I hope it was good!

87
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,633
See you in the next lecture!
