1
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:05,933
So in this video we're going to explore some basic modeling

2
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:09,933
concepts! Let's hop over and draw something!

3
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:13,833
Hi guys, welcome back! Now, we're going to do a little

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,833
exercise with the board behind! Take a step back from Blender, just to grasp

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,833
a few concepts, and then, we're going to hop into Blender and start

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,833
working, using those concepts. So Blender

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:29,833
is great for modeling, as we all know, but it's

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,833
always worthwhile starting with some fundamentals. So we've already played

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,833
with some primitives. Now we're going to work on those primitives

10
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,833
and make them work for us, rather than the other way around. So

11
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,833
I'm going to use this red pen here, to represent what we call a

12
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,833
vertex or vertices. One vertex, many

13
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,833
vertices. So if you remember dot to dot, when you were little.

14
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:59,733
[Marker Board Squeaky Sounds] Isn't that great! I've just drawn what could be many things.

15
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:03,733
I'll draw the top bit there. So that would represent

16
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:07,733
our vertices. If I was then to join these

17
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,733
vertices together

18
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,733
with what are known as edges, we will end up

19
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:19,733
with something. Now, depending on

20
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:23,733
what you want to call that, most people I think would say a house.

21
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:27,733
Now I know of no houses that look like that, but it

22
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:31,733
represents the house itself. A similar argument can be

23
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:35,733
said for.. if I was to draw something like this

24
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:39,733
and then do that. Yes, some people may

25
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:43,733
say it's a mushroom cloud or some may say it's a tree. In fact, in this

26
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:47,733
case, I've drawn a tree, but it's not a reallistic tree,

27
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,733
it's a representation of a tree. And essentailly that's all

28
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:55,733
what low poly modeling is all about, it's enough polygons to

29
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:59,733
make sure what you're trying to show people, what it's representing,

30
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:03,733
is close enough. One final example, if we do

31
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:07,733
a couple of circles, put a line in,

32
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:11,733
and go around our model like that,

33
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,733
most people will see that as a car, and I don't know many cars that look

34
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,733
like that.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
It's challenge time! Draw or model something simple.

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Now this is a bit of an odd one, of course, we've taken a step away from Blender, and the whole

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
purpose of this is to get you thinking about how things

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
are constructed on a fundamental level. So I'd like you

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,200
to just grab a bit of paper and pen and draw somre representations

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,200
of common objects. Whether it's copying what I've done with the house,

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
perhaps add something to it, etc. Think about

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
animals, how are they constructed? For instance, a stick man and things

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200
like that. It's important to grasp how things are constructed,

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,200
because that's going to help you massively, moving on when we start

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,200
modeling things within Blender. If you do have some Play

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Dough or anything similar to that, maybe Plasticine, then try that too!

47
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,200
It's great fun, [Laughs] I certainly had fun doing it! And

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,700
it's very very satisfying creating something, so

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,700
pause the video now, go off and just sketch some representations,

50
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,700
and model if you've got your access to Play Dough,

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,700
Plasticine, etc.

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,766
Alright welcome back! Alright, let's see

53
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:30,233
what I got up to! Well I

54
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:34,966
grabbed my white board and I drew some representations. I

55
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,966
know what all of those items are, just by looking at them,

56
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:40,866
um, but I didn't look at

57
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,233
any reference material,

58
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:47,333
I just used what was in my mind, what do I think

59
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:51,333
these things look like. And we're got a ship, a rocket,

60
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,333
a tree, a house, some sort of bird,

61
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,333
and a train. Now, I'm not sure how closely those

62
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:03,333
resemble real world items, in fact, they're probably

63
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:07,333
far from them, but they're very similar to how kids toys are constructed.

64
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,333
I also got my hands on my

65
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:15,333
childrens' Plasticine and did a little tree and a little

66
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,333
house. Again they're not realistic, but if you showed them

67
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,333
to someone, they would grasp immediately what you were trying to show them.

68
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,333
Alright let's take the concepts we've learned now and head on

69
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,433
over into Blender!
