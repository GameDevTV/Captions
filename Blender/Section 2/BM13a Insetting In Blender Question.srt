Hi guys, just a quick video on the last

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
video! So I want to know, in the solution, whether you found my use

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of shortcut keys intimidating or very useful or

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
somewhere in between. I want to make sure you that I help you guys out, make

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
yourselves as efficient as you could possibly be in Blender,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but I don't want to overwhelm you and be a bit confusing, so I do want your feedback

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
immediately on the last video. Did you find those shortcut keys

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
useful or was it a bit overwhelming or somewhere in

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
between? Thanks! See you in the next lecture!
