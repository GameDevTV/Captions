00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Different Selection Methods! So in this video we're

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
going to learn some more ways to select your geometry using

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
two features, Border Select and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Circle Select. So let's hop over into Blender!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now both of these features are located in the Select menu, on the 3D

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Editor Header. So under Select we can see we've got

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Circle Select and Border Select. Now you may hear me refer

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to Box Select, which is exactly the same thing

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
as Border Select. You're essentially drawing a box or a border around

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the things you wish to select. So you do need to be in Edit Mode, if you're not already,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and you do need to choose what you're going to

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
select, just like you would do if you were selecting things individually, whether they be edges,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
faces, or vertices. So if we hit

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the B key, let's see what happens! So we've got it on Edge Select and

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we're going to draw a box around here. So we've selected every edge

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that line came in contact with, and if we spin

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
around, we will see that it's not selected anything on the other side.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you do want to select through an object, say

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the whole top of this pyramid, I would suggest

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you first move your view around, so you can select the box.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Orthographic View is best, so there's no perspective playing.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You'll want to deselect what you've already selected, and you can just press the A key, which

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
deselects as well as selecting all. Hit the B key

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,800
for Box Select, and

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,533


26
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:38,533
before you do that, you'll want to go

27
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:42,533
into Wireframe Mode.

28
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:46,533
So let's rotate it back around. In Wireframe mode, when you use a

29
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:50,533
selection tool, it selects through your object. So

30
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:54,533
if I'm cautious now about how I'm selecting, that should have selected

31
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:58,533
everything on top. You have to be careful, if

32
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:02,533
I had dragged the box around the actual..ah, too far, I

33
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:06,533
would have selected all the top of the pyramid as well. Now in this

34
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:10,533
view you'll notice, if I then go and box select that edge

35
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:14,533
it adds to the selection. And if you want to remove

36
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:18,533
from the selection, when you're doing the box selecting, you can middle-

37
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:22,533
click. So a middle-click and drag will deselect.

38
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:26,533
Just clicking

39
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:30,533
and selecting more will add to your selection, with no further input.

40
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:34,533
So let's try out Circle Select!

41
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:38,533
Well Circle Select produces a circle, and you can change the size

42
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,533
of that circle with your scroll wheel. So obviously if it's this big and we've

43
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:46,533
got it on Edge Select as we go over, I'm clicking now, you

44
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,533
can see I'm selecting loads of edges as we go, and as soon as...

45
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:54,533
And we see this one here, as soon as all four edges of a

46
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:58,533
face, or however many face...edges the face has, have

47
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:02,533
been selected, the face highlights as well. So if I

48
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:06,533
select that edge there it adds to it. And again, middle-clicking will

49
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:10,533
deselect as you go. So you can deselect and select using

50
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:14,533
both of these selection tools. Very powerful stuff, especially since

51
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:18,533
we can change the size of this circle. Finally, you can't

52
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:22,533
do anything until you've exited the circle, so you do need to right-

53
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:26,533
click at some point to exit, whereas the Box Select automatically

54
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:30,533
exits at the end of the selection. I

55
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:32,633
feel a challenge! OK guys,

56
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:33,266


57
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:37,266
I'd like you to remove some of the pyramid. Using either

58
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:41,266
Border or Circle Select, I'd like you to remove the parts of the pyramid,

59
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:45,266
covering the ramp that we've made ready for the stairs.

60
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,266
So, a quick look here at the pyramid how it is

61
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:53,266
at the moment and then using the various selection methods we need to get to something

62
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,532
that looks a bit more like this.  

63
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:59,533
So here we go, this is what we're aiming for with those faces removed

64
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:03,533
so we can see the ramp underneath.  Now, there are various ways

65
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,533
you are going to be able to accomplish this.  You could do it one at a time.

66
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:12,699
But I do suggest you use one of the quick selection methods so you can highlight the lot and work on it.

67
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,533
So go and pause the video now and give that a go!

68
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:19,533
Welcome back! Let's go and remove those parts

69
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:23,533
of the pyramid. So let's hop straight on over into Blender! Now,

70
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:27,533
we can see quite clearly... Oh, we can't actually,

71
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,533
because this pyramid's the same on both sides, and I've rotated

72
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:35,533
it around several times, so I can't see clearly! One of these has got a ramp under

73
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:39,533
it and one of them hasn't. How do we tell that, well we're going to hop over

74
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:43,533
into Wireframe Mode!

75
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,533
I'm going to move it back into Perspective Mode, and I'm just going to remove all the rest of the orange.

76
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:51,533
So we can see there that there's no ramp on this

77
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:55,533
side and there is on here. So now we know that, we can come out

78
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:59,533
of Wireframe Mode. Now the ramp itself, I'm being a bit forward

79
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:03,533
thinking here. The ramp itself stops on this edge, so we don't want

80
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:07,533
to delete that edge, otherwise the ramp itself will disappear.

81
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:11,533
So we need to delete that edge, all the way down to

82
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:15,533
that edge. We could hold down Shift and select them all, there's not a great number. In

83
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:19,533
this case I'm going to, because I'm at an angle I could make it perfectly square

84
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:23,533
and use Border Select, but because I'm at an angle, I'm going to hit C for

85
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:27,533
Circle Select. It doesn't have to be terribly big, so I'm just drawing straight

86
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:31,533
up here, all the way to there. Finally,

87
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:35,533
I can either go through Mesh, Delete, but I'm just going to hit the X key.

88
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:39,533
Ah, so with the circle selected, remember to right click out of it.

89
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:43,533
OK X! How are we going to delete the edges?

90
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:47,533
There's nothing else just the edges. And there we go, we can see our ramp

91
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,466
underneath. Brilliant! How did you guys get on?

92
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,866
Remember to save your pyramid, if you haven't done already.

93
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:56,866
And oh, I've just had a thought!

94
00:05:56,866 --> 00:06:00,866
We or certainly I haven't named my

95
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:04,866
Cube... That's not a Cube! Oh dear! So let's change that

96
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:08,866
now, so it says Pyramid. Tut tut, if any

97
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:12,866
of you have already named your mesh Pyramid, congratulations you've beat the

98
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:13,999
teacher to doing it!

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,566
Make sure you do name your meshes, otherwise,

100
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:20,566
later on when you have something more complex it's going to be a pain to

101
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:26,266
find anything. See you guys in the next lecture!
