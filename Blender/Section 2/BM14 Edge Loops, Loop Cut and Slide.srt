00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Edge Loops and Loop Cut and

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Slide! So in this video, we're going to go through what

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
edge loops are, how to select an edge loop,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
then we're going to move on to the power of a loop

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
cut and show you how to control it's slide function,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the loop cut and slide. So let's hop over into Blender!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
OK, so we've got our

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
pyramid here. Now I want to demonstrate an edge loop

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
for you. So if we've selected an edge... Let's just

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
pick an edge down here. Oh, we need to be in Edge Select and Edit Mode,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
if you're not already. Ah, we've selected this edge here. And

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
now an edge loop is just a continuous series of edges. So there's an edge here,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
an edge here, and then it disappears behind the model and it comes back again. So if we go to

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Mesh and go to Edges and then

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
somewhere down here there's Edge Loops,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and you can see it's selected that loop of edges.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now the shortcut, the keyboard shortcut for that

18
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,666
is Alt. So if you're holding down

19
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,666
Alt, when you click an edge

20
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:18,666
like so, you will select the Edge Loop.

21
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,666
Now, in this case, all of these go around in a loop.

22
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,666
However, if we were to select this edge here, whilst holding it down, you

23
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,666
can see it terminates at the top and, in fact, terminates at the bottom.

24
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,666
And the reason for that is because these other two edges

25
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:38,566
have come in and created what's known as a pole,

26
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:43,166
where three or more edges join together. There is another exception, where

27
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:47,166
you've got a quad, where if there was fourth line coming in, it would probably

28
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:51,166
continue this edge loop all the way around our model. And

29
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:55,166
the same happens with these top edges, if you try holding down Alt and

30
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:59,166
clicking, you will find that they also don't go anywhere.

31
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:03,166
So that is an edge loop and we can use that to

32
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:07,166
select our edge loop, when we need to modify it. So let's

33
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,466
try using a loop cut!

34
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:13,366
Now the great thing about this is that

35
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:17,366
you can literally cut up your geometry and create more.

36
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:21,366
So if we hop over into face mode, you can see that there are

37
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:25,366
only four faces around the top of this pyramid, and

38
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:29,366
if we hold down the shortcut keys Control and

39
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:33,366
R, at the same time, we end up with this pink thing

40
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:37,366
appearing on the screen. This is how our model is going to be cut up.

41
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:41,366
Now the way that it's deciding where to

42
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:45,366
cut, as you can see if I go towards this top edge here

43
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:49,366
on the pyramid it cuts around our model

44
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:53,366
and the same over here. If we come towards this edge, it cuts

45
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:57,366
around our model, and that would happen on all of them.

46
00:02:57,366 --> 00:03:01,366
By default, this is a proportional cut.

47
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:05,366
By that I mean 0 is in the middle, so let's

48
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:09,366
left-click once, and we can see towards the lower-

49
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:13,366
left it says Edge Slide. So this is the slide part of

50
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:17,366
our cut, it goes from 1 all the way across to

51
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:21,366
-1. So it's a proportional cut and 0 being bang in

52
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:25,366
the middle. So because I've moved it, which you're going to do all the time,

53
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:29,366
I'm just going to press 0 before I

54
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:33,366
finalize that cut. Now if we hop back over into

55
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:37,366
face mode, we can see it's divided those faces.

56
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:43,866
Alright, so I've just opened up a brand new Blender file, just to show you something

57
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:47,866
with a loop cut and slide, that I don't want to show you on the pyramid, because it's a bit too

58
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:51,866
complicated or complex, sorry, to show you on

59
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:55,866
that geometry. However, a nice simple cube, it's brilliant on.

60
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:59,866
So I'm going to hop into Edit Mode really quick, make sure Edge Select

61
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:03,866
is on, and I'm just going to make this shape here

62
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:07,866
a bit more like the pyramid that we've been working on, and I only really care about

63
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:11,866
this front face. So when you're doing a loop cut and slide, when

64
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:15,866
the faces aren't already parallel at the top of this

65
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:19,866
square, let's go and put a loop cut in now.

66
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:23,866
So Control and R and then left-click, and then it enables

67
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:27,866
this slide. And as I mentioned before, it is a proportional

68
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:31,866
slide, and you can see it goes more and more

69
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:35,866
at an angle, as it goes towards the left or the right. Now

70
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:39,866
in the middle,um, it's 0, and on

71
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:43,866
the left it's -1 and on the right it's 1, and we can

72
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,866
see that edge slide in the lower left-hand side.

73
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:51,866
It's going all the way, as I say, down to -1 and up to 1.

74
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:55,866
In this case, I want to put it bang in the middle, so I'm going to hit the 0 key

75
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:59,866
and just press Enter, and that fixes it in that location. Now one

76
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,866
of the great things, when you're cutting up any mode with the Loop

77
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:07,866
Cut is, you can actually place geometry on top of one another.

78
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:11,866
So if I go and create another loop cut now, with Control

79
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:15,866
and R, and we can just see it there. If I move it

80
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:19,866
across and bang it straight up against the previous

81
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:23,866
cut and then select, well actually apply

82
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,866
that change, there's extra geometry on top of

83
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:31,866
one another, at the moment. Now I can use the 3D Manupulator

84
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:35,866
now, just to pull that out, and we can see, if I switch on

85
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:39,866
face mode that there are three separate faces. So it's great being able

86
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:43,866
to put geometry on top of itself, without

87
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,866
worrying about it too much. Now remember, if you've done this the model can

88
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:51,866
become very messy, so make sure you do it with intent and

89
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:55,866
do something with it immediately, rather than just leaving it, otherwise it's going to

90
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:59,866
cause you confusion later on. One final thing to mention,

91
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:03,866
if you're doing this type of thing and you've got Proportional

92
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:07,866
Editing turned on. So the shortcut for that is O, so you

93
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:11,866
might have hit O by accident or indeed enabled it

94
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:15,866
down here. Now, one of the things you will notice when Proportional Editing

95
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:19,866
is turned on, is if I do the same thing again

96
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:23,866
and put one on top of the other and then try and

97
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:27,866
move it, ah there's not an extra bit of

98
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:31,866
there's no extra geometry created. And you also get this circle on the screen,

99
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:35,866
so that's a good clue that you're in Proportional Editing mode, when you start moving

100
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:39,866
things. We'll go through that actual tool later on,

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,366
but just to make you aware at the moment, it's almost the same as if you've had

102
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:47,366
merging your vertices turned on, when doing that

103
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:51,366
thing there. So make sure you've not go Proportional Editing turned

104
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:55,366
on, if you're doing this type of action, and you're going to need that

105
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,166
in the challenge coming up!

106
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,400
It's challenge time! I'd like you to create

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,400
a ramp for our steps, using the Loop Cut and Slide

108
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,400
feature. It just needs to be on one side of the pyramid for this

109
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,400
exercise, and we're going to be creating the ramp needed

110
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,900
for some stairs.

111
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,900
And to give you an idea of the end result I'm going for, it's

112
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,900
a parallel set of steps like this. It just makes creating the

113
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,000
steps going up easier later on.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,600
Pause the video now and give that a go!

115
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Welcome back! How did you guys get on? Now, before we hop over

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,600
into Blender, what I need to make sure is that you're not skipping ahead. I

117
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
really must impress the importance of trying out these challenges yourself,

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,600
and if you're not able to do it, put the owe-ness back on me,

119
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,600
your instructor, your tutor. If you're having difficulties,

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,600
if something wasn't clear enough for you to be able do this challenge, then I

121
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,600
need to modify these videos to make sure it is very clear for you.

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,600
So without further ado, let's hop straight on over

123
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,066
into Blender!

124
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,200
So we've already made one loop cut down the middle

125
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,200
of our model and divided it in two.

126
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,200
We need to make another one, so I'm just going to go

127
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Control and R and line it up there.

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
And I'm just going to move the mouse, at this point, and I'm going to ram it up against this one

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,200
and put those two edges literally on top of one another.

130
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Now once I've done that, I can now control

131
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
where those edges are in our model.

132
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
So I'm going to hold... I'm going to press G and I'm just going to move it. If you moved

133
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
it the wrong way, the model will go a funny color. And now

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
I've moved this out, and I only want it moving in...

135
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm looking down here, towards the bottom-left, the y axis, I'm going to press y

136
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
and that's locked it into this axis. Now,

137
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I want to move it, by the looks of it, by about 1 and 1/2.

138
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm going to type in 1.5 and press

139
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Enter. Now I can do the same thing with this

140
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
edge loop, but I'm going to have to select the edge loop first. I'm going to hold down Alt

141
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
and select it. Then, I'm going to grab it,

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
moving it only in the Y axis, by

143
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
1.5? No, - 1.5!

144
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
So -1.5,

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
there we go! So that's created some fixed points at the top

146
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
and the bottom, that we can link up. And the final thing is to

147
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,400
create our ramp, so I'm going to

148
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:44,233
I'm going to select these bottom two vertices.

149
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:48,233
I'm going to hold down Shift to select multiple vertices. I'm going

150
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:52,233
to, still holding down Shift, I'm going to press these two vertices here,

151
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:56,233
and then, I'm going to press the F key to

152
00:09:56,233 --> 00:10:00,233
generate a face. Now that face is inside our model.

153
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:04,233
I'm going to now change the view to Wireframe,

154
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:08,233
and that also has a shortcut key, which is Z.

155
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:12,233
By pressing Z, when you've not got anything selected, moving, rotating,

156
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:16,233
etc. it will in fact switch to Wireframe Mode. And we can see

157
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:20,233
underneath, that ramp is ready for use.

158
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:24,200
How did you guys get on?

159
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:28,433
I will see you guys in the next lecture, where we're going to use that ramp

160
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:32,433
as the base for our steps.
