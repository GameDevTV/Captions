Hi guys,

3
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:07,933
welcome to Box Modeling! We're going to be covering some awesome stuff in this next section,

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:11,933
really getting you into Blender and making your first model. And we're going to

5
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:15,933
start off with the real fundamentals of any 3D model. What are those,

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:19,933
Ben? So we're going to take you through, from the very beginning, because we think that it's

7
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:23,933
really important to understand what's going on, down at the detail level in

8
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:27,933
Blender. It's really going to serve you in the future, if you get that base layer of your understanding

9
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:31,933
sorted. So we're going to start by telling you what vertices are. Vertices are

10
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:35,933
basically points in space, that's all you need to think about them as. They're just something

11
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,933
in a 3 dimensional space, with an X, Y, and a Z coordinate.

12
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:43,933
Once we've got more than one vertex, let's say well two, we can draw a line between them.

13
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:47,933
And if we do that, what is that line we draw between two vertices? Well that's an edge and

14
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:51,933
edges will make up the majority of your geometry, and eventually,

15
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:55,933
when you have 3 or more edges closed together you

16
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:59,933
get a... You get a face! We'll be talking about faces a little bit more in the middle of the

17
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:03,933
section. But faces are what they sound like, it's a flat surface and it

18
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:07,933
[aw] does actually have a direction to it. A face can be facing outwards

19
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:11,933
or inwards, and that's quite important, so pay attention to that and we'll talk about that a little bit later

20
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:15,933
on. Basically, by the end of the section, what are they going to be able to do, Mikey? Well you

21
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,933
will be able to make any placeholder, any basic model that you like.

22
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:23,933
So think about childrens' toys and how they're representations of real life

23
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:27,933
objects. You're going to be able to create pretty much any of those that you can see.

24
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:31,933
Cool! And by a process of successive improvement, you 'll be able to go from your placeholder

25
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:35,933
objects to fully fledged models, if you want to do that, and here on the Blender course you probably

26
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:39,933
do. Some people might just want to be making placeholders, just to pop in maybe in their game,

27
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,933
and then, go away and carry on with development. Whatever you want to use these placeholders for, they're the

28
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:47,933
starting point for either you or somebody else to take that and make it into a fully fledged

29
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:51,933
model. You might just want to try it out in prototype and see is this the right type of shape and

30
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:55,933
size. Is this the thing I want to go for? So play around with it, have great fun!

31
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,933
And remember, share your creations as we go along! We as instructors

32
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:03,933
love to see what you guys come up with.  And first of all I want to show you one

33
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:07,933
the first things we'll be creating in this section.  It is a very simple

34
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:11,933
block work plane.  It's a great placeholder for any particular plane

35
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:15,933
you're going to use. Maybe not a jumbo jet! But, you get the idea.  This is just a

36
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:19,933
first iteration.  Once you have skilled up this will take you but

37
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,933
a few moments to make.  Of course from this you can build that out

38
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:27,933
and you end up with something more like this: Here we go!

39
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,933
This is literally just a little bit more time.  Well, I say a little a little bit more time it is

40
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:35,933
exponentially more time.  So, the first one I could

41
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:39,933
now do in about a minute- give or take.  This one with more 

42
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:43,933
detail in it is probably going to take me about 5 times longer, maybe even 10

43
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:47,933
times longer if I start putting more detail in.  From this you can

44
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:51,933
now make out this looks kind of like an F-15 or something along those lines.

45
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:55,933
Maybe a Mig?  We just don't know at the moment 'cause the detail's not there, however from

46
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:59,933
this you can build upon it again.  That is the best way of building your

47
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:03,933
models: from the the ground up.  It is very tempting to go straight

48
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,933
for that high poly, ultra realistic, but really

49
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:11,933
if you get these low poly models nailed you will be able to 

50
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:15,933
produce things much much quicker, and work out what you want to keep and what you

51
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:19,933
want to get rid of.  Now by the end of the section we'll be building

52
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,933
these Mayan pyramids.  There is lots to learn with insetting and

53
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:27,933
look at all these stairs!  I wonder how we can go about creating those in a way that

54
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:31,933
is not too painful to do.  This is a very simple Mayan

55
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:35,933
pyramid.  Obviously you can take all the skills you have learnt to add even more detail.

56
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,933
So, remember as you go please do share your work over on the forum.  I love

57
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,933
seeing what you guys come up with.  Especially as you are toying about and playing.

58
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,933
Sometimes you end up with happy accidents.  OK,

59
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,099
I will see you guys over on the next lecture!
