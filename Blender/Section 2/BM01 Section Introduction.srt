Hi guys,

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:07,933
welcome to Box Modeling! We're going to be covering some awesome stuff in this next section,

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:11,933
really getting you into Blender and making your first model. And we're going to

4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:15,933
start off with the real fundamentals of any 3D model. What are those,

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:19,933
Ben? So we're going to take you through, from the very beginning, because we think that it's

6
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:23,933
really important to understand what's going on, down at the detail level in

7
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:27,933
Blender. It's really going to serve you in the future, if you get that base layer of your understanding

8
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:31,933
sorted. So we're going to start by telling you what vertices are. Vertices are

9
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:35,933
basically points in space, that's all you need to think about them as. They're just something

10
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,933
in a 3 dimensional space, with an X, Y, and a Z coordinate.

11
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:43,933
Once we've got more than one vertex, let's say well two, we can draw a line between them.

12
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:47,933
And if we do that, what is that line we draw between two vertices? Well that's an edge and

13
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:51,933
edges will make up the majority of your geometry, and eventually,

14
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:55,933
when you have 3 or more edges closed together you

15
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:59,933
get a... You get a face! We'll be talking about faces a little bit more in the middle of the

16
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:03,933
section. But faces are what they sound like, it's a flat surface and it

17
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:07,933
[aw] does actually have a direction to it. A face can be facing outwards

18
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:11,933
or inwards, and that's quite important, so pay attention to that and we'll talk about that a little bit later

19
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:15,933
on. Basically, by the end of the section, what are they going to be able to do, Mikey? Well you

20
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,933
will be able to make any placeholder, any basic model that you like.

21
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:23,933
So think about childrens' toys and how they're representations of real life

22
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:27,933
objects. You're going to be able to create pretty much any of those that you can see.

23
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:31,933
Cool! And by a process of successive improvement, you 'll be able to go from your placeholder

24
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:35,933
objects to fully fledged models, if you want to do that, and here on the Blender course you probably

25
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:39,933
do. Some people might just want to be making placeholders, just to pop in maybe in their game,

26
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,933
and then, go away and carry on with development. Whatever you want to use these placeholders for, they're the

27
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:47,933
starting point for either you or somebody else to take that and make it into a fully fledged

28
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:51,933
model. You might just want to try it out in prototype and see is this the right type of shape and

29
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:55,933
size. Is this the thing I want to go for? So play around with it, have great fun!

30
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,933
And remember, share your creations as we go along! We as instructors

31
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:03,933
love to see what you guys come up with! Take Care! Have fun! Take

32
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,200
care!
