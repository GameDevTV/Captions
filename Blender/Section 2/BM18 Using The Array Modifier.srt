00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Using the Array Modifier! In this video we're

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
going to introduce you to your first modifier and that is the Array Modifier.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're going to let you know that they are non-

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
destructive until you apply them, and finally how to

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
separate your geometry, so you can work on the array that you've

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,466
generated. Let's hop over into Blender!

7
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:26,666
So here we have our pyramid,

8
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,666
as always, because that's what we've been working on. I don't know whether you guys have been working on

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:34,666
anything in between, but this is our pyramid and we want to play with

10
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,733
the Array Modifier.

11
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,566
Now, over in the right-hand side,

12
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:43,566
if you've still got it open, we need the Properties window open. If you've shut it,

13
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:47,566
if you could bring open a frame and change it to the Properties type,

14
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:51,566
and you may want to drag these out a little more, so you can

15
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:55,566
see all of these different types of properties that we can mess

16
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:59,566
around with. And we want the one that looks like a spanner or a wrench,

17
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:03,566
and when we click on that, we've got this option here to Add a Modifier.

18
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:07,566
If we select Add Modifier and go to an Array,

19
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:11,566
we can see it immediately generates a copy

20
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:15,566
of our pyramid, but it doesn't exist yet, it doesn't

21
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:19,566
exist until we click Apply. So I'm going to generate three of

22
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:23,566
these, and I'm going to change the Offset here.

23
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:27,566
Now Relative Offset means it's relative to the

24
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:31,566
model itself, so they're exactly one of themselves apart

25
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:35,566
in the X axis. And if we have a look we can see that the

26
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:39,566
bottom of the stairs touches the rear of the pyramid each

27
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,566
time. So we can change that, we can set them a little further apart

28
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:47,566
if we want, and we can change the direction of which they're set apart.

29
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,566
Isn't that awesome! So we've got lots of control

30
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:55,566
over what we do there. However these are all

31
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:59,566
one object, at the moment, if I scale one they'll scale the others perfectly.

32
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:03,566
So if we want to make a difference here,

33
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:07,566
first of all we have to Apply. Ah, "Modifiers cannot be applied

34
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:11,566
in edit mode"! No secret, that's why I didn't want to switch over to Object Mode, so you

35
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:15,566
could see that. You do need to be in Object Mode to Apply this modifier.

36
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:19,566
So let's click on Apply and now

37
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:23,566
these three, they're not objects they're all one mesh. These

38
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:27,566
three parts of this mesh are now real.

39
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:31,566
We can start messing around with the

40
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:35,566
geometry of each one. So in order to do that, we really need

41
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:39,566
to separate them out, and there's a straight forward way of doing that. We do need

42
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:43,566
to go back into Edit Mode, and then, we have to select all of the geometry we

43
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:47,566
want to put into its own area. So I'm going to switch into

44
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:51,566
Wireframe Mode and then do a Border Select and highlight

45
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:55,566
all of that. Now I've selected the other model there, so I'm going to go

46
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:59,566
onto the top and I'm going to highlight all of our

47
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:03,566
model, after deselecting because Border Select adds

48
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:07,566
every time. There we go! Now I'm going to press the P key,

49
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:11,566
and we're going to Separate by Selection.

50
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,566
So now we've got Pyramid001, and I'm going to call that

51
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:19,566
excitedly, Pyramid 2. In fact,

52
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,566
in this case it's almost not worth

53
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:27,566
renaming them, but I am because I'm going to do a

54
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:31,566
big pyramid in the middle, once we've separated them all out.

55
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:35,566
So we've got that and we just need to separate this here. So we're going to hop into

56
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:39,566
Edit Mode on that object, and finally,

57
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:43,566
let's just go above everything and hit

58
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:47,566
Box Select and there we go! We've selected everything there, I'm going to go

59
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:51,566
P, by Selection and that's separated that out,

60
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:55,566
and I'm going to make that one Small...

61
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:59,566
Really, SmallPry great!

62
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:03,566
In all my rush, Pyramid. There we go! So

63
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:07,566
we've got Big Pyramid, Small Pyramid, and Pyramid 2, and when we select those we

64
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:11,566
can see they're now all separate objects that we can mess around with. So I can

65
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:15,566
literally grab this now and move it to my heart's content and to

66
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:19,566
where I want. So I can pop it over here, and for the purpose of this exercise I'm

67
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:23,566
going to constrain it to the X, Y axis. So I'm going to

68
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:27,566
exclude it, so it doesn't disappear into the ground. I'm going to pop over here and then finally

69
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:31,566
I'm going to scale it on the Z axis.

70
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:35,566
I can't really see what's going on unfortunately, so I'm going to

71
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,566
cancel that and rotate around. I'm going to scale it on the...

72
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:43,566
There we go! Scale it all the way up, so it's a super

73
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:47,566
pyramid but only on the Z axis. This is going to look a bit funny,

74
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:51,566
but that's OK for the purpose of this. This one I'm only going to scale on

75
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:55,566
the X, Y axis, so it's going to be lovely

76
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:59,566
and flat. As you can see, it's disappeared

77
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,566
into the distance there. And if we make it like that,

78
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:07,566
we've got our three different pyramids, brilliant, and they're all separate!

79
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:11,333
Now it's time for your challenge! Let's hop over

80
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,766
and see what it is!

81
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:16,966
Create your stairs! I bet you guys knew that was coming! So the steps

82
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:20,966
themselves should run from the bottom to the top all the way. I want

83
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:24,966
you to create your steps using the Array Modifier and finish with

84
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:28,966
one mesh object at the end. So there's a clue you're going to have to separate

85
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:32,966
something at some point. Pause the video now and go give that a

86
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,966
go! Welcome back!

87
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:40,966
Let's create some stairs for our pyramids! So let's hop straight on

88
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,966
over into Blender! So let's work on

89
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:48,966
our Pyramid 2, which is this one at the front. I'm going to leave the other ones in the background, just

90
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:52,966
for aesthetics, and I'm going to hop on over into Edit Mode. I'm going

91
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,966
to start at the bottom. You could start at the top if you want. And I'm

92
00:05:56,966 --> 00:06:00,966
going to zoom in right to this front area here. I'm going to go to

93
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:04,966
Vertex Select, and you can do this a number of ways. And I'm going to turn

94
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:08,966
off Merging Vertices, for the moment, because I do want them

95
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:12,966
to be separate. I'm going to click that vertex there and

96
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:16,966
extrude. So I've just created an edge basically, another vertex freely

97
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:20,966
floating in space, but only on the Z axis

98
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:24,966
and I don't know how far to do it. Perhaps 0.2?

99
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:28,966
Yes, 0.2 sounds nice! 0.2.! And then, I'm

100
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:32,966
going to extrude it in the X axis again by

101
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:36,966
0.2. So that's going to be the outline

102
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:40,966
of our stair. I'm going to select it there

103
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,966
and here and extrude this way, and I'm going to

104
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:48,966
snap it over here. So in fact, in this case, I'm going to turn on the

105
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:52,966
snapping to Edge and move it across until its on this edge here.

106
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,666
It's going to cause us a few issues. I

107
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,666
only need to lock it in the Y axis. There we go! So now

108
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:03,666
that's our step, we just need to multiply it several times. However,

109
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,666
it's part of this pyramid, at the moment, so we're going to have to select

110
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,666
the geometry we want, and in this case, it's just these two faces that we've created.

111
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:15,666
And then, we want to separate it with the P key, by

112
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,666
Selection, and it's added it down here, so I'm just going to do that Pyramid 2

113
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,666
Stairs. OK,

114
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,666
so we've got Pyramid 2 and Pyramid 2 Stairs, and the

115
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,666
stairs are what I want to apply the modifier on. So we're going to go down to Add Modifier,

116
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,666
go to Array, and nothing's happened! Why has nothing

117
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:39,666
happened? Well it's probably disappeared inside the model. There we

118
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:43,666
go! If I turn on Wireframe you can see it's disappeared inside the model. So

119
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,666
it's actually going in the X axis in the right direction, it's going 1 step unit there. We also

120
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,666
want it to go 1 step unit up as well. So on Z we want that to go

121
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:55,666
to 1, and there we go, we've got our second step!

122
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,666
I haven't a clue how many steps we're going to need to fill up our pyramid,

123
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,666
so I'm just going to increase this number until it looks right.

124
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,666
Zoom around to the top, I think we need two more. Excellent! So in this case, with a

125
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,666
step height and depth of 0.2 I need

126
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:15,666
35 to get to the top of mine. Now finally,

127
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,666
because they don't exist yet, only the bottom one does, I'm going to Apply

128
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,666
my modifier. Now I can go in and, if I wanted to,

129
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,666
edit these ever so slightly, so I can make one higher,

130
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,666
one lower, etc. etc., if I wanted to. I don't but what

131
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:35,666
I do want to do is now merge these two objects back together. So

132
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,666
I'm going to hop over into Object Mode, select our Stairs,

133
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,666
and our Pyramid and press Control

134
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:47,666
and J for Join. They're now together and unfortunately

135
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,666
it's name is Pyramid 2 Stairs. I don't want that, it's just Pyramid

136
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,666
by itself at the moment. And there we go, we've got our Pyramid with

137
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:59,666
stairs. That's great! How did you guys get on?!

138
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,533
See you in the next lecture!
