Hey guys, well done getting this far in the

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:08,366
course! We know you're doing great, because we see your creations in the discussions!

3
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:12,366
If you're not already posting in the discussions, then please go ahead and do

4
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:16,366
that and also ask questions in the discussions. So once you have

5
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:20,366
finished this section there's other things you could do! What are they, Mikey? Well go ahead and use

6
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:24,366
the skills you've got so far to make some more models. Go off. We've already made

7
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:28,366
a plane and some other things. Go off, perhaps find some kids toys and use

8
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:32,366
those as reference material and make those up in Blender as well.

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,366
Or just crack on with the next section and come back and practice your basic block modeling

10
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:40,366
later. Whatever you like, just keep making progress, keep having fun, keep sharing, and we'll

11
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:42,166
see you soon! Take care!
