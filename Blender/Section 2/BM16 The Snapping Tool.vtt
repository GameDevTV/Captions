00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi guys, welcome to The Snapping Tool! In this

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
video we're going to learn another way for you guys to constrain your

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
movement. We're going to be using the Snapping Tool to do that.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.466
I'll show you how to snap objects into place and how to tell it

5
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.700
what to snap to, and controlling whether

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.700
or not you merge vertices, when you put the two things on

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.333
top of one another. So let's hop over into Blender!

8
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:32.333
So I don't want to start adding random things to our

9
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:36.333
pyramid, so let's open up a new Blender file.

10
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:40.333
So I'm going to go and save my pyramid first. As always,

11
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:44.333
saving is important. I'm going to go to New and load up a new

12
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:48.333
Blender file. So we have one cube here. By default,

13
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.333
snapping is turned off, and you can find the Snapping Tool

14
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:56.333
along the 3D Editor Header, towards the right-hand side.

15
00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:00.333
It looks like a picture of a magnet. When it's turned on, it

16
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:04.333
even looks more like a magnet and that's exactly what it is. And we can see the

17
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:08.333
shortcut is Shift and Tab. Now this is one of those

18
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:12.333
shortcuts, which is incredibly useful because when we start moving

19
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:16.333
our object, this 3D Editor header

20
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:20.333
disappears. So let's demonstrate that now! If I go

21
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:24.333
and move my cube, you can see snapping is actually turned on, and it's actually snapping

22
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:28.333
into the grid in front of us, so it's moving one Blender unit at a time,

23
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:32.333
in a random direction. If we constrain it to Z it will be

24
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:36.333
locked in the Z axis. So by knowing

25
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:40.333
Shift and Tab, we can turn that on and off to our

26
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:44.333
heart's content, even if we've started the movement without

27
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:48.333
it being turned on. Perfect!

28
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:52.333
So the other options, what else can we snap to? Well we're going to need something

29
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:56.333
else to snap this cube to, and we can pick Faces,

30
00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:00.333
Edge, or Vertex. So let's generate another cube

31
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:04.333
in our scene.

32
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:08.333
And let's lift that up, and we can see snapping's turned on.

33
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:12.333
That's kind of cheating because, of course, I can align that absolutely perfect.

34
00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:16.333
There we go, perfectly aligned! But we want to know how to use these

35
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:20.333
other options here, so let's make it not so perfect and dump it

36
00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:24.333
some random place over there. Because once you've done that and you start moving it

37
00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:28.333
with the snapping turned on, they won't line up again, because it's

38
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:32.333
one Blender unit relative to where its new position was.

39
00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:36.333
So if we pick a face and we can then

40
00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:40.333
move this model... I'm just using moving as an example, but it can

41
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:44.333
be any one of the rotations, scaling, etc.

42
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:48.333
If I move the cursor over this face

43
00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:52.333
and click, that cube is now against that face

44
00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:56.333
perfectly! If I want it to be a bit more precise I could go to Edge,

45
00:02:56.333 --> 00:03:00.333
and when I go to move it then... Ah, do bear in

46
00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:04.333
mind, the position of your cursor. It's going to be very snappy and jerk all over the place,

47
00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:08.333
if the cursor's over the top of your object when you start the move. But if the

48
00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:12.333
cursor's away from your object, then you can place it over and you can see it

49
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:16.333
ping snaps into place. And now those two cubes

50
00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:20.333
are basically, they're face planted together which is great,

51
00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:24.333
and these edges are on top of one another. So I could grab it and

52
00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:28.333
lower it down to this edge, or I could be even more precise in going, I want a

53
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.333
Vertex. I want to snap to the vertex, and

54
00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:36.333
down in this bottom corner here. So again, we can move it and point it at that

55
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:40.033
and click, and now these two cubes are exactly aligned.

56
00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.366
The final thing to mention here is, if we

57
00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:46.366
join these two objects together,

58
00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:50.366
so they become one object, and then go into Edit Mode,

59
00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:54.366
we can see they've still got 16 vertices. So

60
00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:58.366
let's go and combine another cube, and

61
00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:02.366
see what happens when we've got the "Automatically

62
00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:06.366
merge vertices moved to the same location" toggle turned on. And that's this

63
00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:10.366
button next to the Snapping Tools to the right. So let's generate

64
00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.566
another cube whilst in Edit Mode.

65
00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:16.866
And let's move it over there,

66
00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:20.866
so we can see there's 36 Edges.

67
00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:24.866
Now if we move it, so it's against this cube and let go, it

68
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:28.866
drops down to 32 edges and it's become part of

69
00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:32.866
the thing we've snapped it to. Now there are going to be times when you do want that to

70
00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:36.866
happen, and there are going to be times you don't want that to happen. Remember

71
00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:40.866
but if you do want to go back later on, you can always go down and

72
00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:44.866
Remove Doubles in your scene, but if you know

73
00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:48.866
that you want it to be joined together straight away, so then we can lift this one up by

74
00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:52.866
a Blender unit and create a kind of a ducting type shape.

75
00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:56.866
Then, brilliant, you can do that straight away without having to go over and Remove

76
00:04:56.866 --> 00:04:58.733
Doubles and then do it.

77
00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:02.733
So one final thing with snapping! So I'm just going to

78
00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:06.733
add... I'm going to go into Object Mode here and just add

79
00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:10.733
another cube to our scene. And it's just placed it where the

80
00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:14.733
3D Cursor happens to be. I'm just going to drag it out of the way here.

81
00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:18.733
Now I'm going to turn the snapping to Vertex, and

82
00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:22.733
we're going to use that and make sure the snapping's on. Now notice to the right of it, it says

83
00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:26.733
Closest. Now what that basically means is, if I

84
00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:30.733
start to move this, so I'm going to press the G key for moving,

85
00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:34.733
and I move it close to this edge here you see it snaps. But I want

86
00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:38.733
this vertex, this one in the corner here, to snap to that one there.

87
00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:41.700
And you can see, when I'm moving it,

88
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.300
it's not doing that it's moving the other one across,

89
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.300
so occasionally you have to wiggle things about. Now that this vertex

90
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.300
here is the closest to this one, when I try and move it and move my cursor

91
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.300
over that corner, it snaps in place, and that's

92
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.300
similar if you need to place something. If I need to put that

93
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.300
vertex in that corner just there and

94
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.300
let's say I want to place it all the way over this side,

95
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.300
and I'll just use G and move it here, you see that the cube ends up right

96
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.300
on the other one and I don't want that. So you need to move it to this side of it

97
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.300
so that this vertex is closest,

98
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.300
and then press G to move and move it across and snap it in

99
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.300
place. So it can be a bit picky, at times, if one

100
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.300
of your vertexes is closer than the other or edges closer. And there are a couple

101
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.300
of other options here, but generally Closest is good enough.

102
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.300
to get you there. So play about with snapping and you'll soon get the hang

103
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.300
of which bit will snap to what, and if you need to move something like

104
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.300
here. If I wanted to now move it to this one here,

105
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.300
well that's not what I want at all! So I'll move it across here and

106
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.300
probably going to have to shove it along here a little, and then grab

107
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.300
it and move it across. I've now got it in place! So it can be

108
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.300
a bit picky, but you'll get the hang of it in no time at all.

109
00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.500
So let's hop over to our pyramid and do a little

110
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.200
challenge!

111
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.200
So what would I like you to do with your pyramid? Well we're going to create that

112
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.200
ramp now and merge it in with the rest of our model. So using

113
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.200
the Snapping Tool, I'd like you to extrude your ramp to the right height,

114
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.200
and then join up the top and bottom edges so that the

115
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.200
bottom edge meets the floor and the top edge meets the actual step

116
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.200
at the very top. So it's a continuous ramp from the top step

117
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.200
to the floor, and I do suggest keeping it a 45 degree

118
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.200
ramp. This is all part of planning our model because if

119
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.200
we make it any but a 45 degree ramp the steps, that we're

120
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.200
going to put on it in a bit, will be much more difficult to make, because

121
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.200
we're going to have to do a different ratio to step, not 1 up and 1

122
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.600
across. More on that later.

123
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.933
OK, just so you guys know

124
00:07:57.933 --> 00:08:01.933
what sort of shape we're going for on the ramp, this is what my end

125
00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:05.933
scene is going to look like, with that ramp on there at 45 degrees,

126
00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:09.933
as you guys can see here. So go ahead, pause the video now, and give

127
00:08:09.933 --> 00:08:12.100
that a go!

128
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.900
Welcome back! Let's hop over

129
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.733
into Blender!

130
00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.900
So let's open up our

131
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.800
pyramid.

132
00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:28.633
Let's go ahead and select our ramp

133
00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:32.633
and extrude it up! But how far do we extrude?

134
00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:36.633
Well let's have a look! Let's switch straight over into Orthodgraphic

135
00:08:36.633 --> 00:08:40.633
projection and have a look at our model from the side. So

136
00:08:40.633 --> 00:08:44.633
let's extrude up, and lets...it's going to be

137
00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:48.633
about there, so it's level with those steps.

138
00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:52.633
We're going to have to turn the Snapping Tool on, for a start. We're going to need to

139
00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:56.633
line it up with an edge somewhere. So let's

140
00:08:56.633 --> 00:09:00.633
extrude up and select this leading edge here, at the very top.

141
00:09:00.633 --> 00:09:04.633
And that's lifted it up to the right height, but unfortunately,

142
00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:06.566
it hasn't joined it

143
00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:09.933
at the top or the bottom, so we need to do that

144
00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:13.933
now. So we can select the top edge, make sure Edge Snapping is

145
00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:17.933
turned on, and literally, move one over the other

146
00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:21.933
and it's going to snap in place. Now before I do that, I'm just

147
00:09:21.933 --> 00:09:25.933
going to press Escape to cancel the move, I'm going to merge the vertices, because I do

148
00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:29.933
want that to become one object. So I'm going to move it again over

149
00:09:29.933 --> 00:09:33.933
the top there and click.

150
00:09:33.933 --> 00:09:37.933
There we go! So that's all together, that's the top bit done! However,

151
00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:41.933
let's go to the bottom one now and see what we can do there.

152
00:09:41.933 --> 00:09:45.933
Let's go all the way down here. So we can see, because we've planned our

153
00:09:45.933 --> 00:09:49.933
model to be 1 by 1 by 1, and we know this is a very

154
00:09:49.933 --> 00:09:53.933
geometric shape, it's perfect because we can just go

155
00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:57.933
straight back. Because we zoomed in we've got all these smaller squares, we can

156
00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:01.933
switch back to Increments, grab the front

157
00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:05.933
edge here, flip back to the side, and

158
00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:09.933
go down a little until we're flat with the floor, and then out

159
00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:13.933
until we're level with one Blender unit.

160
00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:17.933
And let's zoom back out. Now we've got our step completed almost.

161
00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:21.933
Now switch back to Perspective Mode. We

162
00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:25.933
need to change the normals for our step, we've inadvertently

163
00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:29.933
created something with the normals pointing inwards. I can tell that by the

164
00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:33.933
color, but you can double-check by turning the little hairs for the normals on.

165
00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:37.933
However, I'm just going to select my entire model

166
00:10:37.933 --> 00:10:41.933
and use the shortcut keys Control and N to make

167
00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:45.933
sure that all of my normals are facing outwards. I'm

168
00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:49.933
going to deselect and just check it over again. That looks perfect!

169
00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:53.933
How did you guys get on? I shall see you in the next lecture!
