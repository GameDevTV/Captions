00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,466
Welcome to Merging Vertices in

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:06,466
Blender! In this video we'll explore

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:10,466
Wireframe Mode, how to merge two vertices

4
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:14,466
into one vertex, why you would want to do

5
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:18,466
this, and how to control the sensitivity of

6
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:22,433
that merge. So let's hop over into Blender!

7
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:26,433
In front of us here we have the periscope we've been working on.

8
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,433
I'd like you to look at the Info Header, right at the very top of your

9
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:34,433
Blender window, and cast your eyes over to the right-hand side

10
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:38,433
where we can see it says Blender version 2.74. Then, it gives

11
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:42,433
us Verts and that says 20. We also can see 16 Faces.

12
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:46,433
So we're going to use that information, coming up, so we can

13
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:50,433
keep that as our reference. So let's hop over

14
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:54,433
into Edit Mode and make sure Vertex

15
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:58,433
Select is selected and let's just

16
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,433
scroll around and count our vertices. I count 12. If you count

17
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:06,433
all of the vertices that are here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

18
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,433
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. So what's going on?

19
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:14,433
Why are there 20 vertices and I'm only seeing

20
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:18,433
12? Well even though we've merged this, so it's one mesh,

21
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:22,433
it's remembered that the vertex that makes up this

22
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:26,433
wedge is different from the one that makes up the cube, even though they exist in exactly

23
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:30,433
the same point in 3D space. So how do we

24
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:34,433
go about selecting the other one, because at the moment,

25
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:38,433
it doesn't matter where I click around this area, I can zoom in,

26
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:42,433
I just can't select it. Well not only does Wireframe

27
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:46,433
Mode, which is down here, so near Edit Mode

28
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:50,433
on the 3D Header we have our Viewport

29
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:54,433
Shading options. We can select Wireframe, we can also use the Z key.

30
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:58,433
So you may have told it, if you've ever tried to undo something

31
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:02,433
and miss-hit the keys. Now we're in

32
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:06,433
Wireframe mode. If you select, can you see it toggles

33
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:10,433
between the vertex on the wedge, and we can see that with the orange lines,

34
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:14,433
and the vertex of the cube. Now, ordinarily there'll be another

35
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:18,433
two lines coming out on these two edges here,

36
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,233
however, they are covered up.

37
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:23,200
So how do we merge these two together

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,200
and why would we want to do that? Well let's cover the why first. So I'm

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200
going to hop back onto solid shading, and I'm going to go to Edge

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Select. And remember that whenever you select Vertex

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Select, Edge Select, or Face Select, what it's essentially doing

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,200
is selecting the vertices that make up that face

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
or that edge, or indeed, when it's just a Vertex Select just the vertex itself.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,833
So if we select this front edge here,

45
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,133
it's likely to have selected

46
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:55,033
that wedge rather than the cube. And if we drag that forward,

47
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:59,033
it has excellent, we can see that's made more of a

48
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:03,033
house shape. So, in this case, we may not want

49
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:07,033
to merge these together, because now they're actually in two separate

50
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:11,033
places. However, if we wanted

51
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:15,033
to move the whole lot at once, thus creating a completely different

52
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:19,033
shape, what we'd want to do is merge these vertices

53
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:23,033
with these ones here. So if I Shift and click that

54
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:27,033
edge inside, as well, and go over to the

55
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:31,033
left-hand side onto the Tool Shelf and scroll all the way down,

56
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:35,033
there's an option to Remove Doubles.

57
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:39,033
Now, when you click on Remove Doubles nothing will happen,

58
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:43,033
and that's because the four vertices we have selected

59
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:47,033
are very very far from one another. They're

60
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:51,033
0.0001 Blender units. So we're going to

61
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:55,033
have to increase this number, down on the lower-left,

62
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:59,033
until they snap together. And there we go, they have now snapped together!

63
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:03,033
Now we can see, up there, that it's removed two vertices, because we're

64
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:07,033
now on 2, which is the 2 either side of this edge, out of

65
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:11,033
18 rather than 20. That's brilliant!

66
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:15,033
Let's do another example down at the bottom!

67
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:19,033
We're going to go to Vertex Select, select this one here,

68
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:23,033
and going to go into Wireframe, so I can select the other one

69
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:27,033
that's in exactly the same place. This time when I hit Remove

70
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:31,033
Doubles, because the Merge Distance is so high it's definitely going to work, but

71
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:35,033
because they are in exactly the same place in space,

72
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:39,033
it would work anyway. And that's removed another vertex, and now

73
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:43,033
we shall see that the amount has also dropped down, now to 17.

74
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:47,033
So I feel a challenge coming on! Are you guys ready?!

75
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,766
I'd like you to make your periscope the minimum number

76
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:55,766
of vertices that it can possibly be. Go ahead and

77
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:59,566
try that now!

78
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,400
Welcome back! Let's go and make our periscope have the

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,400
minimum number of vertices that it needs, in order to make the same shape.

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,400
So I've got this bit of a squiffy thing going on here!

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Now if we lower the merge distance all the

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
way down to 0.00001 and select our

83
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,400
entire model and click on Remove Doubles,

84
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,400
it will remove the extra 5 vertices, in this case, that I had,

85
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,400
so now we have 12 out of 12. You could have

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
gone around and done each one individually for more control, but

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,400
in this case, because of the merge distance, I've lowered all the way back down

88
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,400
to a very low number. It only merges the ones that are in

89
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,400
exactly the same place in space. Now

90
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,400
I've now got full control over the model, and I can move that roughly

91
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,400
to where it was before. And, in fact, with the Median distance

92
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,400
here with the Y, I can actually go in there and type -1,

93
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,400
and that will probably straighten it up to where it was before. That looks

94
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,400
pretty neat to me! Excellent! How did you guys

95
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
get on?! Did you decide to select all of the

96
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,400
vertices and then just Remove Doubles on the entire model, or did you go around

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,400
one by one and take a bit more caution over it? Of course,

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,400
if you had had a very high number, when you were

99
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,400
merging, so we selected all and you clicked Remove Doubles, but this

100
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,400
was something much much higher, perhaps earlier on, you could have ended up

101
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,400
with a line or some sort of other shape going on.

102
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,400
A kind of cool sort of fractal crystal going on there, but

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
it's no longer our periscope.

104
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
And in fact, if it was really really high, you would find that all of the

105
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,200
vertices would merge to one point, and then, you would just have

106
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,200
one vertex left in your model and that's not really 3D anymore.

107
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
In fact, it's no dimension because it's just a point [Laughs] in space. But well,

108
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,200
let's stop being silly, and let's drag that all the way back down to where it was before,

109
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,300
so we've got our periscope back again. If you haven't

110
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,933
done it already, I suggest you go to File, Save As.

111
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:11,933
Name it something like Merging Vertices in Blender or whatever

112
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:15,933
you want to call it yourself and save that file. As always,

113
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:19,933
I would recommend saving as much as you can.

114
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,933
I do like the versioning, you can use that as a

115
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:27,933
fallback as well, as well as the system, or indeed Dropbox, but I do

116
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:31,933
like having finite control over what I'm doing. So in this case, I've Saved

117
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:35,933
As, and I've called it (Merging Vertices in Blender), for my own reference.

118
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:39,933
Remember guys, please save! Once you've lost work,

119
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:43,933
or messed it up beyond belief, it will be incredibly hard to get it back!

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,900
OK guys, see you in the next lecture!
