Hey guys, it's time for an extra challenge, because you already possess

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.766
all of the knowledge you need in order to create these railings. So

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:11.766
I've given you an example, down at the bottom. Remember this is

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.766
your project, you can make the railings as tall as narrow as

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.766
wide as you want, but do follow them through all the way from

6
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:23.766
the ground, all the way up to the building on the top.

7
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:27.766
Pause the video now and give that a go!

8
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:31.766
OK guys, let's hop straight over into Blender!

9
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:35.766
We have our pyramid here and we've got our ramp, so let's

10
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.766
give it some railings. Now I know that I'm going to be

11
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:43.766
using the two edges of the ramp to create some extra geometry,

12
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:47.766
however I know as I extrude over

13
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.766
the top of this, I'm going to end up with a face underneath our faces.

14
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:55.766
So the first thing I'm going to do is select that

15
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.766
top face and get rid of it. So we're left with a

16
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.766
nice hole in our model but that's OK. The next thing we need to

17
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:07.766
do is select an edge, and I'm noticing the direction of the arrow on

18
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:11.766
the Y axis, so I know I'm extruding along the Y axis

19
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:15.766
and that will come out. It looks like I've still got snapping turned on. No need to

20
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:19.766
undo everything, I just do Shift and Tab to stop that, and I

21
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:23.766
want to move it in. I don't know, I'm glancing down at the lower-left

22
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:27.766
to just have a quick look at the numbers. 0.2,

23
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:31.766
0.2 feels about right, so I'm going to go for 0.2

24
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:35.766
and I'm going to do the same for this. Now noticing the direction of the arrow again, I'm going to

25
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:39.766
extrude but this time again on the Y axis, but this time it's

26
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.766
going to be a minus number and it's going to be...I do want them to be equal, so it's going to be

27
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:47.766
- 0.2. And then, finally we just need

28
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.766
to join these two edges up to form another face.

29
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:55.766
I'm going to select all four to make sure it knows exactly where I want

30
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:59.766
to put the face and nowhere else, and I'm going to press F. Oh dear!

31
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:03.766
I didn't want to do that! Let's undo that, because this

32
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.766
edge at the top, it doesn't run all the way nor does

33
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:11.766
that one, so that should have been fine. However, it appears to have created a double

34
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:15.766
face. So let's just do this edge and this edge and press F.

35
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:19.766
There we go, that's exactly what we need! Finally, just in case

36
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:23.766
I've created some loose geometry

37
00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:27.766
in there, I'm going to select my entire model and just Remove Doubles.

38
00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:31.766
And I've removed 4 vertices in that case.

39
00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:35.766
Alright, so we know need to...we've got this here so we now need to create the railings

40
00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:39.766
themselves. So in Face Select Mode I'm going to select the two

41
00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:43.766
outside faces, and I'm going to extrude them up

42
00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:47.766
but not like that, actually up according to the world which is

43
00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:51.766
a global up, so Z. There we go, that's exactly what I want!

44
00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:55.766
And I don't want them too tall, because that would look ridiculous. In fact, the taller those

45
00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:59.766
are the smaller this pyramid looks. Now it looks like a kids toy,

46
00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:03.766
now it looks epic and impossible to walk up. So that looks like it's going to be about

47
00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:07.766
0.4, 0.5, or something like that, so I'm going to go about 0.5.

48
00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:11.766
I'm happy with that! And finally, we need to bring the top of the railings,

49
00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:15.766
so no one falls off of this giant thing of course. Um..So I'm going to

50
00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:19.766
select those two faces there. I don't know if I've got the ability to select that one. No I'm not zoomed in

51
00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:23.766
enough. There we go! So these two faces are selected, I need to

52
00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:27.766
place them up against one of these faces

53
00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:31.766
here. So I'm going to make sure snapping is turned on, I'm going to go to Face

54
00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:35.766
Select, I'm going to press E to extrude, and I'm going to select

55
00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:39.766
anywhere on this face, and there we go we have our

56
00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:43.766
railings! How did you guys get on? Did you get to that part there? Did

57
00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:47.766
you have any challenges whilst doing that? I hope you were successful,

58
00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:51.766
and I shall see you in the next lecture!
