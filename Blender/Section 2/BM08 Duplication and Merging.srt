00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Duplication and Merging!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So in this video we are going to learn about duplication,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
because there are two types of it, and create one mesh

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
from multiple objects. So let's hop straight

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,200
over into Blender!

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,833
So here we have our wedge pointing upwards, that we were using before.

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,833
So we want to make a duplicate

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:29,833
of that wedge. So if we go down to Object

9
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,833
and about midway up there are two Duplicate

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,833
Options, there's Duplicate Objects and Duplicate Linked.

11
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,833
They are almost the same but they

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,833
have some radical differences. So we're going to, first of all,

13
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,833
Duplicate Linked. Now nothing happens immediately

14
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,833
but if we move the mouse we can see there's another wedge

15
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,833
right next to it. Now these two are linked and we can

16
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:01,833
see, in the Outliner, it's produced another wedge with Wedge

17
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,833
001. I'm just going to name that

18
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,833
something more appropriate, straight away, and call that the copy

19
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,833
just so I know which one's what. So because they're linked,

20
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,833
they should do similar things to one another.

21
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:21,833
However, when you're in Object Mode, if you just say change

22
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,833
the scale of something it doesn't effect the other object. And

23
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:29,833
you may be wondering well they're linked, well why isn't this one

24
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,833
resizing this one, because they are linked and that's the whole point

25
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,833
of linking them in the first place. Well if we go to Edit

26
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:41,833
Mode and we start playing about with our model, let's say moving that edge

27
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:45,833
down, you can see then it does effect the other side!

28
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,833
And similarly, if we hop over to this wedge,

29
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:53,833
our original one, and go into Edit Mode, we can

30
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:57,833
see that that also effects it. So that's really cool! See

31
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,833
you can alter the actual structure of a mesh,

32
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:05,833
however you can scale things completely independently of one another.

33
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,833
So in Object Mode these two are actually an identical mesh, however,

34
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,833
this one has a different Z scale to it, so it's

35
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,833
slightly taller. In fact, in this case, oh in this case because

36
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,833
there it's twice as wide along the bottom. So it's a great

37
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,833
way of using a base mesh and actually

38
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,833
using it to create more things, down the line, but also vary them

39
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,833
so they're not all the same. Now if we switch

40
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,833
over to Duplicate Objects and I

41
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,833
place this one over here, it is completely independent.

42
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,833
It's essentially a complete copy of the wedge.

43
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,833
In fact, it is a copy of this one, because that's what we've copied

44
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,833
in every form and face. So if we went into

45
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,833
Edit Mode on that and moved it about, it is completely independent

46
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,833
of these two. Right, so I

47
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,833
want to get rid of that redundant wedge, and I can actually delete it straight

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,833
here. You see I see it's Wedge Copy 001. I can right-click

49
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,833
there and just Delete. Alternatively, I could go down to

50
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,833
switch it to Object Mode and go to Object and

51
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,833
Delete is there, or press the X key and confirm, but I'm just going to do it in the

52
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,833
Outliner. So we have these two wedges

53
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,833
here and it's produced two meshes, as we can see, but

54
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,833
we may want that, eventually, to become one object.

55
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,833
So how do we do that? Well let's open up our Tool

56
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,833
Shelf again. Now you can leave these things open, by the way. I

57
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,833
just put them away when I'm not using them, because I'm running a lower

58
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:49,833
resolution than you might be. And we see an option here

59
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,833
to Join. If we click Join, well it

60
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,833
doesn't do anything because we've not got two or more meshes selected.

61
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,833
So if we hold down Shift and select the other mesh, we see

62
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,833
that one is active, which is orange, and this one has gone a kind of red to

63
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,833
mean it's included in the selection. If we now go to Join,

64
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,833
it's actually put them under one mesh. Now

65
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,833
incidentally, that's also broken the link that they had before.

66
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,833
So we've got both things selected there, however, if I just select

67
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,833
this one it now moves independently. So they're no longer

68
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,833
a duplicate linked object, the moment you join them back

69
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,833
together, so it's worth bearing that in mind. OK,

70
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,633
I feel a challenge coming on! Are you guys ready?!

71
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,766
We're going to create a

72
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:43,766
periscope! So I would like you to create a periscope,

73
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:47,766
existing of 2 wedges with a cube

74
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:51,766
in the middle. And just to make it a bit more challenging, I would like

75
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:55,766
the periscope's base to be at (0, 0, 0).

76
00:04:57,366 --> 00:05:01,366
And just for reference, this is the type of shape

77
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:05,366
we are looking for, a very basic periscope,

78
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:09,266
or I suppose, looking at it, a 3D parallelogram.

79
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:12,666
So pause the video now, go off, and give that a

80
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,666
go! OK

81
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,666
welcome back! Let's hop into Blender and see if we can solve

82
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,666
our periscope issue! So I've been playing lots

83
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,666
with these wedges. I've been moving them up and down, moving them left and right,

84
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,666
and so I've got myself in a bit of a pickle. And if you ever

85
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,666
do this, you may want to consider remaking

86
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,666
your wedge, because it can sometimes be quicker

87
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,666
to just start from scratch, rather than trying to repair these wedges

88
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,666
so they look like the periscope.

89
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,666
They're a bit hard to work with at the moment. So I'm just going to

90
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,666
Delete my wedge completely. I'm then going to

91
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,666
create a cube, I'm going to zoom

92
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:04,666
in, and let's see what we can do here. I'm going to go into Edit Mode,

93
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,666
and with Vertex Select, I'm going to

94
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,666
remove that vertex there and this one here. You may remember this from the creation

95
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,666
of our wedge. And I'm just going to Delete the

96
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,666
Vertices, and then, I'm just going to Join these up, as we've

97
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,666
done before, and that will

98
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,666
create our first wedge for our periscope.

99
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,800
So the next thing we need to do is...

100
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Well a periscope is that plus another one, so I

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
am going to go to Mesh, I'm going to... Ooh, let's switch to

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Object Mode first. I'm going to go to Object and then go to Duplicate.

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
In this case, I am going to just duplicate it, I don't need them to be

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
linked. And we've got our other one here, so I'm just going to click that,

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
and I'm going to place that still at 0, 0 on the X,

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Y. But I'm going to basically

107
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
lift it up, let's say, by 4 for the moment so it's just above

108
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
the other one. OK,

109
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
it looks like our wedge here isn't at 0, 0, because that

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
was the position of the 3D cursor, when we started. So now these two

111
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
should be in line with one another. Now this bottom one,

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I want it to be the other way around, so I'm going to rotate it. Let's see,

113
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
skewer through the X axis there. I'm going to rotate that

114
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
by 180, so it becomes upside down. That's great!

115
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
In fact, that's looking good already, however that's not on the

116
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
base, at the moment, however, I'll deal with that, in a moment, once I've joined all

117
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800
of these together. The final thing is to put a cube into the middle of

118
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
this mesh, and again, it's produced the cube at the

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
3D cursor, rather than anywhere else. So I

120
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
want the X and Y to both be 0, and

121
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
here this just needs to be 1. Nope! Let's try 2!

122
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Perfect! So there we have our base periscope shape.

123
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Now what we want to do here is just lift it up, so it's

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,800
base is where the Z basically equals 0.

125
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,800
So the first thing I'm going to do is highlight all of my

126
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
objects, and I'm going

127
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
to go to Tools, on the side here, and go to

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Join. So there we go, we've got one shape now, one mesh,

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
that makes up our periscope and I just need to lift it up.

130
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
And as we can see, the Origin of this shape has been set

131
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
to the bottom. So, in this case, I think we just need to

132
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,800
lift it up by 1. So if we lift it up by 1, bang! That's

133
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
bang on the surface complete! So there we go,

134
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
there's our periscope! How did you guys get on?! Please

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,700
remember to post your

136
00:08:56,933 --> 00:09:00,933
periscope in the discussions so we can see how you got on!
