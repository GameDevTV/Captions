00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,166
Welcome to Subdivision!

2
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:06,166
In this video we're going to go through what subdivision is and

3
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:10,166
also cover the dangers of subdivision. So let's hop over

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,166
into Blender! Let's pick a

5
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:18,166
very straightforward surface. Let's go for this one here.

6
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:22,166
Now, when we have a look at this, we can go,

7
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:26,166
once it's selected in Edit Mode as a face, because we're

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:30,166
subdividing a face at this point. We can also subdivide an edge

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:34,166
as well, it's simply going to cut it up equally. So

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:38,166
on the Tool Shelf itself we have the Subdivide button there

11
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:42,166
next to all of the other modifiers you can

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,166
use, and we can also use the W key, which will bring up

13
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:50,166
this Specials list and we can pick Subdivide.

14
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:54,166
And we can see it's split it into four equal portions,

15
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:58,166
height-wise and length-wise. Now down

16
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:02,166
in the lower-left, the modifications the operations

17
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:06,166
tool for the Subdivide, until we select away it will be there,

18
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,166
and we can increase the number of cuts. Now you have to be incredibly careful,

19
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:14,166
because this is exponential. If you divide..subdivide

20
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:18,166
something too many times, you'll end up with Blender crashing

21
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:22,166
on you or your computer grinding to a halt, so

22
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:26,166
I wouldn't recommend going crazy with the subdivision.

23
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:30,166
If you need more detail, in a certain area, like let's say this

24
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:34,166
lower-left hand corner, go in and subdivide

25
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:38,166
something else. So lower-left hand

26
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:42,166
corner here. Let's go in and subdivide that and

27
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:46,166
then subdivide that, rather than cutting the whole

28
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:50,166
model up into smaller pieces. Although you'll get

29
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,166
much better control it becomes far more fiddley to work with, the smaller

30
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:58,166
your geometry gets or the more detailed it gets.

31
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:02,166
So what would I like you to do? There's a challenge

32
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,733
coming up!

33
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:07,733
So I'd like you to create a doorway into the temple!

34
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:11,666
Let's go and create that now! 

35
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:16,066
So the surface that I'm going to subdivide is this one

36
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:20,066
here, this face, and I'm just going to subdivide it once, see

37
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:24,066
where we get and subdivide it once more.

38
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:28,066
There we go! So now we've got equal sides, and I'm

39
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:32,066
going to select these here.

40
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:36,066
And once they're selected, we can extrude them

41
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:40,066
into our temple. I'm going to turn off snapping and just move that in.

42
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:44,066
Now at any point, we can decide to add

43
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:48,066
further geometry inside, but we do have to be careful.

44
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:52,066
That is, if we make the inside here too detailed, 

45
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:56,066
it's going to look very odd compared to the outside. So if we were to,

46
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:00,066
let's say, go in here and just make the doorway...

47
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:04,066
Yep that's it! Let's push that in a little further, and then,

48
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:08,066
in here make another doorway

49
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,633
going off this way.

50
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:13,066
And perhaps splitting this

51
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:17,066
area here. Let's

52
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:21,066
subdivide that, switch to Edge Select,

53
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:25,066
see if I can get that vertical line there.

54
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:29,066
I have! Excellent! The 3D Gimbal is just

55
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,233
getting in the way there,

56
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:32,900
so I'm going to grab that and move it in the X direction,

57
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,900
along to there. Now hopefully that's split

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,900
up our geometry. Ah, it looks like a double

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,900
made an edge at some point, so I'm just going to undo that.

60
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,900
Oh, I just want to move that in, I didn't want to subdivide or anything.

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,900
So let's select that and then move that in. That's fine, that's

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,900
moving freely. So X, I'm going to just move that in there,

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,900
because then I can make another doorway

64
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,900
and just push that in. As I said, we do have to be careful of how much

65
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,900
detail we decide to put into our model, because the more you put in

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,900
the more odd it's going to look compared to everything else. But I think that's about

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,900
the right level of detail. If there we some shadows casting in there it wouldn't just be a blank,

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,800
it would look like there was something in there at least. And

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
there's one final thing I would like to cover. If you have made

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
a very similar model to mine we will notice,

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,800
at the top here, we have what we think is a

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
square. However if you decide to subdivide

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
this, my natural instinct would be to go ahead

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
and delete these faces

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
here and make a nice square, so I can split it up into equal areas.

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
So let's go and try and do that now and see what happens! I'm just going to Delete

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
the Faces. I'm going to switch to

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Edge Select and select the edge loop running around

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
the top of this model and just press F to fill it in.

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Now, if I click Subdivide, now my natural instinct

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
tells me that's going to just basically chop that square into quarters.

82
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
So let's hit Subdivide and nothing happens.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
So let's switch to Vertex Select to see

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
what's going on there. And we can see that this square is

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
in fact not a square. If we look up here we

86
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
can see that the Vertices that I have selected are 16. In fact, this is

87
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
a 16 sided square, it just happens that some of the sides

88
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
lie in line with one another. Now this is a special

89
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
case where it's called an ngon, a numbered

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
sided polygon. In this case it's a polygon that looks like a square but, in fact,

91
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
has 16 sides. Now you cannot subdivide,

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Blender doesn't know how you want that to be subdivided,

93
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
because it's so confusing for it, basically, even though in our

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,800
minds we can see that as a square. So in order to create

95
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
geometry on top of our model, we're going to have to create it separately

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
and then manipulate it on top of our model. So let's go

97
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
ahead and do that now! I want a couple pillars on top here, so I'm just going to undo the

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
subdivide, because I really don't want

99
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,600
all of those vertices on top of my

100
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,600
model. And in fact, I'm just going to undo it all together so I can

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,600
play with this area here. So if we go and select these

102
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,600
and Subdivide, it will subdivide the faces. If we select

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,600
there and Subdivide that, we end up with something that we can start working

104
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,600
on. So I'm going...That is a square I think. Yes it is!

105
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,600
So that's a square there. Can we join that into

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,666
one object? Cast

107
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:53,266
your mind back to when we were making our plane

108
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:57,266
earlier on. We could merge these

109
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:01,266
together. So if we Remove Doubles, that sounds an odd thing to say,

110
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:05,266
and turn up the Merge Distance what happens? Well,

111
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:09,266
It puts it all into one place. So let's do that for

112
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,500
the entire top of the model and see what happens.

113
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:16,033
Eventually I presume that this would merge to a point.

114
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,900
This is where the Circle Select comes in

115
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,900
handy. Remove Doubles.

116
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,900
Yes, that moves it to a point! Let's see if there's

117
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,900
a happy medium for us.

118
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,900
Ah hah! That's nice! So we

119
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,900
can play with this and we end up with our four squares on top. It makes the

120
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,900
geometry around our model a little odd, but that's

121
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,900
actually made it so we've got our four squares. And then,

122
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,900
we can subdivide them into the areas we want. Now,

123
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,900
there's a bit of a stroke of luck there that wouldn't always work out for you. What

124
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,900
I was going to propose is, now you've got that small area there, you can remove those

125
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,900
faces and then recreate a square in there, and it would

126
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,900
only have four vertices for that square. Ah but now we've got

127
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,900
this area here, that was very fortuitous. We can lift these

128
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,900
up to make our special areas here,

129
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,900
and it's in danger of looking a little

130
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,900
wonky, so scale that one in on top.

131
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,900
And as we can see there, it hasn't scaled into the center. In this

132
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,900
case I don't mind but you can see that it's a bit wonky,

133
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,900
whereas before you wouldn't have expected it to do that, and that's

134
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,900
because it has extra geometry around the edges

135
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,900
here. So whereas this edge here and this edge here

136
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,900
are just one face, these are two faces. So

137
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,900
it weights the extrusion or rather the scale slightly differently.

138
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Of course, once we've done that, we could grab it and limit

139
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,900
it and move it so it's roughly in the right place again. And unless

140
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,900
you're being super, you know analyzing it down to the

141
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,900
core you probably won't notice, because you're going to be

142
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,900
over here. Alright, that sums up this lesson!

143
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,900
How did you guys get on to create anything fancy? Let's

144
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,900
see your creations in the discussions. Take care!
