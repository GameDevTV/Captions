00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.733
Hey guys and welcome to this video! We're going to talk a little bit about

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.733
the Lean Production process, start getting you thinking about your work flow! Right,

3
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:13.733
Mikey!? Yes! Now, I've struggled with the concepts of Lean Production, because

4
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.733
that's not generally how we're taught to do things. We do

5
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.733
everything, almost, in our lives in batches, and when you switch over to Lean

6
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:25.733
Production it actually makes things a lot easier, but it takes a while to get your

7
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:29.733
head around and Ben's going to explain that a bit more in detail now. Yeah! So what's

8
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.733
lean about? Really it's about three things. Lean is about delivering value

9
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.733
to the customer, i.e. something that the customer will pay for, the

10
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.733
end customer. So say you are making bowling pins and a bowling ball, in this case,

11
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.733
and you're handing it over to a game developer,

12
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.733
eventually there's going to be a game made, and somebody on the app store is going to be flicking through and deciding

13
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:53.733
whether they're going to buy that game. And if what you're about to do isn't going to add to that end

14
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:57.733
experience, it's not value. So that's what value is, it's about delivering something

15
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:01.733
you'll pay for. Yep! And in this case, that's exactly how we're making

16
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:05.733
the course. We output something to you guys as quickly as possible, and then let you guys give

17
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.733
us the feedback, as quickly as possible. And you want to employ that, basically,

18
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:13.733
in your modeling, so you want to make sure you get to the end result as quickly as possible. Find

19
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.733
all the problems you're going to have and then jump back again and reiterate and make

20
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.733
them better. It's all about a feedback cycle, making sure that you get that feedback

21
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:25.733
quickly and improve your model or improve the course or whatever

22
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:29.733
you're working on, as quickly as possible. Yeah, so feedback is key.

23
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:33.733
Mikey says deliver the end result. Now we need to be careful about that, let's deliver a first version of the

24
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.733
end result. Yes! That's the whole point here! And like sometimes, maybe,

25
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:41.733
when an images loads on the web and it's just really fuzzy and then it gets sharper and sharper.

26
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:45.733
That's kind of like Lean, because it's giving you an impression of the entire thing. Very

27
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:49.733
early on you can go, am I or am I not interested in waiting for the rest of this image?

28
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:53.733
And that's a bit like your bowling pins or your bowling ball. What you want to do is mock something super

29
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.733
simple up, get it through to your game developer, for example, and then, get their feedback.

30
00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:01.733
They might go, oh well the pins have got too many polygons for my colliders ore the ball doesn't look right

31
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:05.733
or the axis is wrong or the handedness is wrong or something. So get a really

32
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:09.733
basic version and then keep iterating. So in this video we want to help you to understand

33
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:13.733
that Lean is not about Pre-Production, Production, and Post Production.

34
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.733
We want you to imagine that you're creating these bowling assets,

35
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:21.733
these assets for a bowling game, computer game. Yep! We

36
00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:25.733
want to help you understand how many iterations you need to do. Yes that's very important, because it's very

37
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:29.733
easy to keep going and keep going and keep going and searching for that

38
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:33.733
100% perfect and that is an unobtainable goal. What we really want is

39
00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:37.733
that 80/20 rule! You've probably heard of that, we want to get to that core 20%

40
00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:41.733
that is going to produce 80% of our outcome. Absolutely! So this

41
00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:45.733
production method is a way of discovering. Your first base is to discover

42
00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:49.733
20% of the work that you need to do, just 20% of all the work you could do,

43
00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:53.733
that's going to deliver 80% of the value. That might well be that you're a perfectionist and the

44
00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:57.733
80%'s not good enough and that's fine, but then, we'll work out what the 30% is that gives you

45
00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:01.733
95% of the value and so on. Diminishing returns

46
00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:05.733
can rear their ugly head very quickly, whenever you're doing anything like 3D.

47
00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:09.333
So in the slides for the course, we've given you a little bit of information

48
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:13.333
here. Let's just define Lean again, this is just a summary of Wikipedia. It says that it eliminates

49
00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:17.333
waste created through overburden or an uneven production process.

50
00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:21.333
So let's talk about that for a second. It's all about not wasting your time

51
00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:25.333
or not wasting any input, before

52
00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:29.333
you get stuff to the customer. So I've already produced some bowling pins and a

53
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:33.333
bowling ball for Ben and his Unity course that he's working on, and

54
00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:37.333
the first thing I did was I went away and produced a wonderful, great big

55
00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:41.333
high definition, bowling pin and we soon found we were

56
00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:45.333
running into problems. Now, I spend a lot of time getting that, in my mind,

57
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:49.333
bowling pin perfect for Ben, but, in fact, it wasn't perfect for Ben, because I didn't

58
00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:53.333
understand the constraints he was under with, what he was doing. So then, we

59
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:57.333
very quickly went into a series of rapid iterations to get to

60
00:03:57.333 --> 00:04:01.333
exactly what Ben wanted, and that was important because, otherwise, it's

61
00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:05.333
wasting my time generating all that stuff that's of no value to Ben

62
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:09.333
and then ultimately you guys, if you're taking the course.

63
00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:13.333
But ultimately I'm also wasting Ben's time, since he sat there waiting for an asset.

64
00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:17.333
So it goes both ways, about eliminating both sides of the waste.

65
00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:21.333
So the whole point is to really plan your work, right, so we want to eliminate waste.

66
00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:25.333
We want to maximize the flow or value, i.e. something that the customer will pay for,

67
00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:29.333
and ultimately it's about gaining the highest possible quality, it's about finding a way

68
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:33.333
of making that thing that is at the highest possible quality.

69
00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:37.333
Now, I must stress at this point, it is a learning journey to get

70
00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:41.333
to a Lean production, and you are going to find that it's difficult,

71
00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:45.333
from time to time, to adjust to that, because you'll want to achieve the best results

72
00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:49.333
you possibly can. However, we urge you to iterate as many

73
00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:53.333
possible times that you can. In fact, there's a good fable about this, and Ben

74
00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:57.333
tells it incredibly well! Well I'll summarize it here but there's a fable that

75
00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:01.333
may be an approcraphle story, but the idea is that a teacher of a pottery class says guys, I'm going to

76
00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:05.333
divide the class in two this term. One half of you are going to be rewarded with a prize at the end

77
00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:09.333
of the term, for those who have made the most, the person who has made the

78
00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:13.333
most pottery, we're just going to put it on a scale and see who's made the most. On the other side of the class,

79
00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:17.333
we are going to reward the person who makes the best piece of pottery, and guess what,

80
00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.333
at the end of the term it was both the person that made the most pottery that also made the single

81
00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:25.333
best piece of pottery, which is kind of against what you'd think. You'd have thought that the person who

82
00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:29.333
labors over one supposed masterpiece would produce the best thing, but actually, the process of

83
00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:33.333
iterating and just doing more stuff, throwing more at the wall,

84
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.333
and maybe more sticks. So that's the concept here, it's get

85
00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:41.333
busy, get active, and get the entire pipeline done.

86
00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:45.333
We're going to be showing you that the bowling pin that you create, for example,

87
00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:49.333
in a game engine needs a very different type of mesh

88
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:53.333
for collision detection, and that mesh has some constraints on it. It must be convex

89
00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:57.333
and it must have 255 or less polygons,

90
00:05:57.333 --> 00:06:01.333
and that is very very different to the visual mesh that you're going to create.

91
00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:05.333
And in future sections we'll also be talking about things like normal maps

92
00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:09.333
or bump maps and how this ties into the process. So please get it through the whole pipeline! You know

93
00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:13.333
we showed you about handedness... Yep! ...and about left and right-handed coordinate

94
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:17.333
systems and also about what's up. Yep! Yep!

95
00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:21.333
Y or Z, all of that you want and scales, that's the other thing. Get all that

96
00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:25.333
out early or the game guy may go, the scale is all wrong and it's pointing in the wrong direction!

97
00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:29.333
Obviously with a bowling pin that's not going to be an arduous task to rotate it, but if you

98
00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:33.333
just produced 1,000 assets for something and they're all the wrong way up, that's going to

99
00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:37.333
annoy, well it's going to annoy everybody in the production process. However, if you're

100
00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:41.333
running a Lean production, the first asset they receive, they could have given you that feedback

101
00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:45.333
and no more problem further on. So in your mind remember the progressive

102
00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:49.333
JPEG! You get to that website, you get a fuzzy image, and then, it gets sharper and sharper

103
00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:53.333
and sharper. Even Netflix does that when you watch it, and the thing is, you can make a decision

104
00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:57.333
about the complete product and say, yes I do or I don't want it in that form. You can

105
00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:01.333
change the film, before you have to wait for that high def stream to buffer;

106
00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:05.333
you can change the image, before you wait for the full thing to download. The same thing, get your models

107
00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:09.333
to the end user as quickly as possible, and then, improve and improve and improve.

108
00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:13.333
And that's where the box modeling, we've already covered, comes in, that's literally your

109
00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:17.333
placeholder asset, that you would move about to see whether it fits in your scene,

110
00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:21.333
to see whether it's the right size, scale, upright, and everything else. So

111
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:25.333
that's why that's core to getting that simple model out there, straight away. And also,

112
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:29.333
all the unexpected things won't catch you out either! There can be a million things you can imagine

113
00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:33.333
maybe going wrong, to do with lighting or reflections or scale or rotation,

114
00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:37.333
it goes on and on and on. And by progressively building up the entire

115
00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:41.333
pipeline and not just working on your model in isolation, but delivering it out, delivering it out,

116
00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:45.333
rendering it, post processing, the whole lot, then you're going to avoid

117
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:49.333
those mistakes. Another brief example we gave, when chatting about it early, was maybe you've been

118
00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:53.333
asked to just do a close in realistic thing of somebody's face.

119
00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:57.333
And maybe you missed the part of the brief that they're going to crop everything but their eyes and you spent three days

120
00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:01.333
modeling an ear and it's not going to appear as part of the scene. Or maybe something that's reflecting in the

121
00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:05.333
eyes is very important, that you've included in your scene, so it matches some real footage.

122
00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:09.333
It goes on! The point is, iterate like they do in the films and you'll be

123
00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:13.333
golden! Excellent! Well let's get on with some modeling! Let's do it!
