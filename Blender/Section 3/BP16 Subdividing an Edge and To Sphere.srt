00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Subdividing an Edge and

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to Sphere! So in this video we will be using this

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Subdivision Tool to add edge geometry, so adding some more

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
vertices on an edge to take more control out of it, and

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
using To Sphere to create a circular

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
hole. So let's hop straight into Blender and carry

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
these out!

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,500
So here we are in Blender with our to soon

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,500
be bowling ball! So first of all, a bowling ball

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,500
is nice and smooth, so I'm going to

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,500
find on our Tool Shelf here, under the Tools Tab,

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Smooth Shading, so we've got a nice smooth surface,

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,500
and I'm going to hop over into Edit Mode.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Now we've got a series of triangles we can work at here, and the

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,500
subdivision, on the modifier, that we chose

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,500
has generated a few artifacts. If you look

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
closely, there are a series of six triangles or

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
hexagons being created, but also, occasionally there's a pentagon

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
where they join up and around that pentagon the geometry's just a bit

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,500
distorted, around there. So we're going to stay clear

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,500
of the ones with five going around,

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
and we're going to stick to the six ones. So I'm going to find a space in the middle

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
and we're going to create one of our holes. So here is

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
absolutely fine! So I'll go to Face Select

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
and click on these faces here, I'm just going to select a group of

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,500
them. You could use a series of selection methods to do that,

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
I'm just holding down Shift. And what we can do

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
here is literally extrude in. So we'll see what that looks

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,500
like, if we do that. So we've got that there, that's being extruded

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
in. That's great! Let's see what that looks like by hopping straight

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,500
back over into Edit Mode! So it looks like there's a hole

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
in the ball, which is great! It's quite a deep hole, I haven't gone through the other

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,500
side, fortunately, no control over that! And

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,500
it looks very rough, I mean that looks absolutely horrible. It doesn't

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
look like an appropriate size hole, to begin with, and neither does it look the

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,500
right shape, it's a hexagonal hole. so even though we've got Smooth Shading

37
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
turned on, that's not hidden the fact that we've cut a hexagon

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
into the surface of our model. So let's hop back on over

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
into Edit Mode, and I'm going to undo that last step

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
of geometry. So we need to have more

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
of a step going in, and one of the easiest ways to do this is to,

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,500
first of all, we're going to select an edge loop. So we want to

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
select the edge loop that's going around our model here,

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,500
the hexagon basically, and

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
if we go to Edge Mode, hold down Alt, and try and do that, it won't work.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
And the reason it won't do that is because there isn't an edge loop that's well defined there.

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
It doesn't know which way to go. I mean these are all triangles,

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,500
so it doesn't know which way to go. Each time, it doesn't know whether to go this way,

49
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
that way, this way, or any other way. In fact, it's got one, two, three,

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
four, five possibilities and directions, so Blender just does

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,500
not know which way to go. However, we can help it

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,500
by simply selecting some triangles again

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
and insetting. So I'm going to use the shortcut key I,

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
and it doesn't have to be by much, it can just be by that. Now the

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
moment we've done that, we've actually broken up and we've created a series of

56
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,500
quads around the outside of our new hexagon.

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Now when we do that and we select an edge loop,

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,500
when we hold down Alt, we actually get the edge loop itself, which is

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
brilliant! That's exactly what we wanted! Now the

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
tool, To Sphere, can be gotten at in two ways. You can

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,500
hold down Shift, Alt, and S,

62
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
and we see in the lower-left the command, To Sphere,

63
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,500
has appeared, and that is one of these

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,500
proportional things, so it goes from 0 to 1.

65
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,500
And, as we can see, it's going backwards and forwards, it's making

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
absolutely no difference to our hexagon, and the reason

67
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,500
for that is, because there's only six edges that is

68
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,500
already spherized as much as it can. So we need to

69
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,500
add more edges, even though the shape will be the same, but we need to

70
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
add more edges, so that it can spherize

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,500
or make it circular, in this case, since we're dealing with

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
almost a 2D object. So

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I'm going to cancel that by hitting Escape. The other way you can get to To Sphere

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
is to hit the Spacebar. And ooh, you can see that was my

75
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,500
last search! So this is a very good lookup

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,500
for commands, if you can't find them.

77
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,500
And we can see, if I type in "sphere", it gives us a couple of

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
choices there and To Sphere,

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
and it also gives the shortcut keys Shift, Alt,

80
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
and S. So brilliant! But we know that's not working, at the moment, so we

81
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
have to subdivide this edge. So we leave that

82
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,500
selected and we can do two options, we can either go to

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Subdivide, here on the Tool Shelf, or we can go to Mesh,

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Edges, and Subdivide, or you can get to another

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,500
menu, which is on the W key, as well. And

86
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,500
if we go W, and Subdivide is right at the very

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,500
top, very powerful, and take note of what

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,500
else is on here, it's a Specials menu. So we just want

89
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Subdivide, and that's cut every one of these edges

90
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,500
into two, because we've subdivided by 1.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
So it's cut everything into two. We subdivide by two,

92
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,500
it's cut everything in to 3 and 4, etc., etc.

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
So now I'm going to go for 3 and see what happens

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
now, and we can go straight on and try

95
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
To Sphere. So Shift, Alt, and

96
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
S, and as we move the mouse to the left and right,

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,500
we can see at 0 it remains a hexagon shape. But now as

98
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
we approach 1, if you look in the lower-left there, as it goes

99
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,500
up towards 1, we get a lovely circle in our mesh.

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Brilliant! That's exactly what we want! So let's hop straight into Face

101
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Mode again, and select these six slices of that pie,

102
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
and try pushing that into the model, and let's see what's happens.

103
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Let's go into Object Mode to remove all that.

104
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500
So we're almost there but it still looks horrible! It looks now like

105
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
it's a circle cut, but we're seeing the extra

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,500
geometry, the hexagonal geometry around it, or the

107
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,500
series of triangles that make that up. So we need to do one more step to make that

108
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
nice and neat. So if we hop back into

109
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Edit Mode and undo that step, we can do

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
one final thing and that is insetting this

111
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,500
by a little bit, before we then extrude

112
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,500
inwards. Now, once we've done that and we hop back

113
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,500
over, we see that that nasty geometry surrounding the hole

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,500
has gone. So by insetting, we have given it the opportunity

115
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
to not look so horrible. OK, I think

116
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,833
it's challenge time!

117
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,833
OK, so I'd like you to create the next two circles we need!

118
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,833
So if you have done it, undo the extrude into

119
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,833
the sphere. We're going to deal with that, in a moment, so it's correct.

120
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,833
Then, we're going to create two more holes,

121
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,833
and then, using reference materials, just so you get the

122
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:02,833
hole positions right... So use reference materials to

123
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,833
guide their placement. Pause the video now and give that

124
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,833
a go! OK guys, welcome back!

125
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,233
Let's hop over into Blender!

126
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,233
Alright, so we have our

127
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:19,233
one hole here, and I'm simply going to

128
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:23,233
go a bit further up and I'm going

129
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:27,233
to put two more holes... Let's see,

130
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:31,233
they have to converge relatively close to one another.

131
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:35,233
So designs, decisions, design

132
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:39,233
decisions. So I'm going to pop it in

133
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:43,233
Perspective Mode, I think, just so I can get an eye on the ball.

134
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:47,233
Yeah! That's going to be about right there! So we can see the line

135
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:51,233
coming up here, so no it won't be there, not at all.

136
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:55,233
It's probably going to be there and there.

137
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:59,233
Now, that looks far too close together! If you look at

138
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:03,233
reference materials and pins, that just won't look right. So

139
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:07,233
let's remove that, and that one, well I'll keep that as a reference

140
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:11,233
because I will need, that

141
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:15,233
will be the lower triangle of the next set that I can possibly use.

142
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:19,233
So that one there and that one there, and let's

143
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:23,233
follow the line down. No, I've got that wrong! I'm blind as a

144
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:27,233
bat, when it comes to this obviously! Let's zoom in a little

145
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,233
further and see if we can actually get things lined up. So there will be a flat

146
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:35,233
edge coming up here, so the next available one

147
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:39,233
is that one there and this one here.

148
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:43,233
Now you can see what I'm getting at there! I'm just trying to make sure that it's lined up appropriately,

149
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:47,233
and actually, that one looks a bit too

150
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:51,233
far apart. So is there anything in the middle of this one here and that one

151
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:55,233
there? Nope, so I'm going to leave it like that for

152
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:59,233
the moment. Now, because I've selected them both at once, you can do this

153
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:03,233
by the way, so we can inset at the same time.

154
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:07,233
Now I cannot remember how far I inset

155
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:11,233
before, so I'm just going to do it by eye. That looks about

156
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:15,233
right, and now, we need to select

157
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:19,233
those two edge loops. Let's try and do everything in

158
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:23,233
one fell swoop here. So that one and that

159
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:27,233
one. Great! I'm now going to subdivide those,

160
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:31,233
so we go to Subdivide, and we set them to 3 which is

161
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:35,233
great! We can do that! Now, with

162
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:39,233
them both selected, I'm not sure, at this point, if it's going to

163
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:43,233
sphere correctly. No it's not!

164
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:47,233
you see there, it's doing something weird, so we are going to have to select these

165
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:51,233
individually. So let's select this edge loop here, and then, go

166
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:55,233
To Sphere and wack that up to

167
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:59,233
1, so it's 100% spherized.

168
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:03,233
And now, just select this one and do the same so it's

169
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:07,233
Shift, Alt, S, or you can go Spacebar, To Sphere.

170
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,233
And there we go, we've got our next circle!

171
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:15,233
And of course, my instruction before was to undo your extrude here.

172
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,666
So if you haven't done that, what can you do?

173
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,533
In fact, what we will do in the

174
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:25,533
next lecture is correct that, as if you had made this mistake.

175
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:29,533
That's absolutely fine! And I shall see you very shortly!
