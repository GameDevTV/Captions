00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Importing Reference Material! In this

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
video we are going to go through the fact that there are two ways of

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
importing reference material. There are basically background

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
images and textured planes. Now, because we know

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
nothing about texturing, at the moment, we will be using background

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
images, and they also give us a fundamental control, whereas

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
planes can be a bit more tricky to get right. So let's

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
hop straight over into Blender and experiment with

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
background images! Now, there are two ways

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of doing background images in Blender, and

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
one of them is really simple and one of them is a

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
few more clicks and simple. So I'll show you the menu option, first of all.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So if you haven't already got it open, you'll need to open the

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Properties Pane, by pressing even the N key. I pressed and clicked on the little

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
+ and opened up this Properties Pane of

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the 3D Editor. Now, if we scroll right down towards the bottom,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
there's a section called Background Images. Now we

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,700
can click to make a tick in this box

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,700
and expand this option and we can add an image. But before

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,700
we go and do that, I would like to quckly show you the other way of bringing

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,700
an image in. And if you go to any image

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,100
on your computer,

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,800
for example, I've got an image example here; I can click and

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,800
drag it straight into Blender. Just close down Finder there,

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
and we get a similar show as we've got here. We could have just

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
opened up our Background image. Now, there's a lot of information

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,800
in this view here. So the first thing we're going to cover is the

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
fact that I can't see my image. Where is it? Well there

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
are two constraints for a background image. You must

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,800
be using an orthographic projection, so let's go and

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,800
set Orthographic Projection now. So I still

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
can't see my image! You have to be looking along one of the

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
X, Y, or Z axes, so you could look at it from the Front, Top, Bottom, Left,

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Right, etc. So if we switch the view now to Bottom,

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
we can see, hey thumbs up! We can see it! If we

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,800
switch to Left, it's there as well,

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
and if we view it from the front, it's there as well! So

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
that means that it's on all of our axes, and we can change that with our

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
first dropdown here. So I'm just going to expand the

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Properties Pane, so we can just see what's going on here. So it's an image,

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
that's fine! It's All Views, so we can actually control

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
here where we can see the image and where we can't. I'm going to

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
leave it on All Views, for the moment, because that's fine for the purpose of this

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
exercise. Source image, it's a Single Image. That's absolutely fine.

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
That's where we can find the image, which is great, ImageExample.

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Going down. So Opacity, now depending on the

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
darkness or lightness of your image, this basically fades this away into the

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
background, so it's less so it's not as strong on the screen. Of course,

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
100% Opacity means that you cannot see the model

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
at all. Now we can see it's at the back, at the moment, so let's zoom in a little

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
so I can see what's going on! Now we have our cube here,

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
our default cube, and we have the image

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
behind it, so if we have anything on the screen.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
So if I scale our cube up a little, you can see that our background

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
image is behind that cube.

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
If I had moved it to the front, it's always going to be in front of whatever

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
geometry you're working on, and this is where you may want to play with the

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Opacity, so that you can still see your geometry.

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Now, in general, you'll probably want it set to Front

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,800
so you can see the reference material itself and so it's not

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
hidden.

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,100
What does this X thing do? Whoah, it

63
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,100
moves it along this X axis! What does the Y do? Well,

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,100
in this case, it does move up or down and that's a little confusing with the way

65
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,100
we're viewing it, because that's actually the X Z axis,

66
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,100
at the moment. But essentially, that's going to move it up or down, and those

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,100
are, of course, Blender units! Then, we have our two options here to

68
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Flip Horizontally and Flip Vertically as well. It doesn't like

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,100
being flipped vertically, as we can see there. And finally, we've got

70
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,100
two down at the bottom, so you've got a scale there with the

71
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Size modifier, and finally Rotation so we can

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,100
rotate it around at a set angle. So that's great! We've got

73
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,100
our background image there! I think we can now do

74
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,233
a challenge!

75
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:51,033
I would like you to import, into our Blender file,

76
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:55,033
the PinReference.png and set that

77
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:59,033
as the background image. I'd like you to make

78
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:03,033
sure that it's only visible from the front,

79
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:07,033
and get the image as up front as possible. I've noticed

80
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:11,033
that the image itself is slightly wonky to one way or

81
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:15,033
the other. I can't remember which way it is. Now, bear it in mind that the real

82
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:19,033
pin is 38 centimeters in height. I would like

83
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:23,033
you to think about the scale that's going to be

84
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:27,033
appropriate to what you're doing in Blender. So

85
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:31,033
pause the video now and import the pin

86
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:35,033
and scale it accordingly.

87
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,066
OK welcome back! Let's hop over into

88
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,166
Blender!

89
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,200
OK so here we are in Blender!

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,200
So let's go and import our PinReference! So I'm going to go down to

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Background Images and Add an Image. Just

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,200
scroll down some more and click Open. I've stored mine

93
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,200
in my Donwloads folder. I suggest you store yours in a Project folder.

94
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,200
And, first of all, I'm going to just set it to the

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Front axis. I can't see it, at the moment, because I'm not looking

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
by the Front, and I'm still in Perspective. So let's change it to Orthographic

97
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Projection and move around to the Front.

98
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
So there is our pin! Now, arugably I could do the

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,200
rotation now, while it's much larger. In fact, I think I will! Let's just

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,200
rotate it by a degree. Em, that looks much better to me!

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Excellent! So let's use a cube

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,200
or another bit of reference material, it doesn't matter, as a

103
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,200
guide, if you will, to scale this reference image. So I'm going to get

104
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,200
rid of that one thats there, and I'm going to create

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,200
a new object, it doesn't matter what it is.

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I'm going to create a Cube. Why not? The Radius, so the Radius,

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,200
that cube's actually 2 in height. So it's

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,200
going to work to a scale of say 3.8 Blender

109
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Units. I'm thinking about it. We don't really want it very very

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,200
small, we need to work with it. So that's nearly 4, so half of 4 is

111
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,200
2, so we need 1.9 on our Radius.

112
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,100
Now that's perfect! That's now the correct height! What we

113
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,433
can simply do is go back to here to our scaling, and we can't see which

114
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:22,433
one's scaling, at the moment. Here we go, Size and let's just

115
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:26,433
all the way down, and we can't see it any more.

116
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:30,433
So let's bring our... Here we go! Let's bring our image to the front. Ooh, that

117
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:34,433
looks like it's worked perfectly! So 1.2 seems to be spot

118
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:38,433
on! I'm happy with that! So there we go, we've got our reference

119
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:42,433
material imported, straightened up, and to the

120
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:44,900
right size to work with in Blender.

121
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,433
Let's move on to the next lecture!
