1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the Final Scene! So

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
it's challenge time, straight away! You need to make 10

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
pins, correctly spaced. Now, if you're unsure about the spacing,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that they need to be, use reference material for the correct spacing,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and remember, you may be working at a scale. We're

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
working, in general, at 10 times at the moment, so 30 centimeters would

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
be 3 Blender units. You're going to have to create

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
9 additional pins in our scene.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So you can do that in a number of ways, I'll let you choose how you go about that.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a couple of ways I can think of, you can just duplicate and move,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you could use the Array Modifier. It's up to you, go ahead and try that!

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Name your object in the Outliner, and you can use the reference material for

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the numbering of the pins, for instance. And go crazy, make it exciting,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so manipulate those pins, make them look like they've been smashed in to by the ball! And

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to see your final composition! Please

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
share in the discussion, it would be great! So pause the video now and go and

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
give that a go! So here we

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
are, back in Blender! Let's go ahead and multiply

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
our pin! Alright, so the first thing we need to consider

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
is, how many of these do we want? We want 9 of them, and there are several

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
ways we could go, we could literally just duplicate 9 of them and manually position

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
them, or we could use an Array Modifier and go

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
through that way. I'm going to use a combination of them both. So I'm going to

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
create four of them first, by going to the Array Modifier.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So with our pin selected I'm going to go to our wrench,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to go to Add Modifier, and go to Array,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and I want four of them, so I'm going to put the Count at 4.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, before we used Relative Offset, I'm going to use Constant Offset

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
this time, so it's not spacing off pins, it's actually a

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
distance between. And I think they're about 12 inches, which is about

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
30 centimeters. I'm not going to do the exact number to keep

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
things easy for our calculations here. So that would transpire

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
up, because we're working at 10 times scale to 3 Blender units.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So there we go, with a constant Offset of X equaling

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
3, we get our four pins ready. And I'm going to apply that

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
straight away. So now that that is

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
applied, the next thing we need to do is create our additional pins. So I'm simply going

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to duplicate this new mesh that we've made. So there we go, I'm

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
going to lock it to the X Y axis, by holding down Shift and

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Z, so now it's not going to fall through the floor or end up in the air. Now we need to do

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
some positioning here, and I know we're going to be moving this one forward

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
by 3 Blender units and then moving it across by

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
half of that, so 1.5, so we're moving along here. And

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
we look down at our little axis, that is positive Y to go that way

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and then positive X. So

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm just going to go and move that,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I could do it in the Operator Panel, that'll be far easier,

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
because then I don't need to worry about where it is. So X needs to be 1.5.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There we go! And Y needs to be 3.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Excellent, so that's in the right position! Yes we've got an odd one over here but we're just

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
going to delete that in a few moments. And I'm going to do exactly the same

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
process again, I'm going to duplicate it. Job done!

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, I've positioned it in a very weird place, but that's OK, because in this Operator

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Panel we've got X, Y, and Z there. So I can set the Z back to 0!

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The Y again, so it's forward by 3, so I've almost got that

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
right there, but the X needs to be 1.5 again.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And then, I'm not going to produce another four

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
or another three additional ones here, I'm just going to go into our

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
objects here, and I'm

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
going to separate them out. So I do need to be in Edit Mode to do that, so select one of

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
these first of all, select this first group, and we're going to separate

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
all of these. So let's hop over into Edit Mode and

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
then P to Separate, and then,

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we need to choose not by selection, like we've done before, but By

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Loose Parts. So all of these bits of geometry are not

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
connected to one another. So first thing, before I do that, I do need to highlight

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the entire mesh, there we go, otherwise we'll be separating that little

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
window that was selected at the front. So P,

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Separate, By Loose Parts. And you can see it's generated

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
a few more meshes and we'll go ahead and name those, in a moment.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And let's go on to this section here, hop

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
into Edit Mode! Select all of our model,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Separate, By Loose Parts. And we'll do it once more on this

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
top one, so we're going to simply go into Edit Mode,

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
select everything, press B,

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Separate, By Loose Parts. So again, we're here

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and I'm going to use one of these, so let's leave them.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to use that one there and actually move it to the forefront here for

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
us. So I'm going to use that, I'm going to move it in

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the X by

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
-4.5 I think, Yeah brilliant, that's in the middle! Then, I'll just need to move it

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
again, in the Y by 3. So there we go,

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
we've got that sorted! There are our pines laid out! I'm going to

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
select these two and delete them.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Brilliant! So we should have a count

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
of 10 pins. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Brilliant! Now the reason why

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
you can't just count the ones on the screen is, because if there was a pin on top of a pin

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you wouldn't necessarily see it, but that's not the case in here.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The Outliner shows 10 pins, but they're not named correctly. So let's go get

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
the naming convention and see how we're supposed to name them!

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wow, so we didn't have to go far here to see our

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
layout and what the numbers are. So that's great, now we've got that for reference, We can

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
hop straight back over into Blender and name our pins!

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Alright, so let's whiz around here, I feel like this is the way they

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
should be labeled. So this one's going to be Pin 01 and it's blatantly

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
not, at the moment. And because we're going up to 10, I'm going to leave the dot

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
in there and call it Pin 01. There's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
9, 10. So a very arduous thing, I may

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
need to speed up the video, if I can't bore you all with waffle.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So I'm just going through here,

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
really quickly, renaming all of our pins to the appropriate

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
names, making sure that I'm referencing them correctly.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
OK, so with all of our pins

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
labeled now, we can start being crazy with it! So let's

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
move this bowling ball into a much more dynamic position. Let's

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
move this over here, let's move it right

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
into the middle of our pins, and now, let's move these pins

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
with a bit of artistic license.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I'm just going to grab a pin,

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
rotate it around slightly, lift it up, have some fun with it.

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This one, of course, because the ball's come in, will

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
be somewhere over here, so shift it over there, rotate it around.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Brilliant! And we can just play with this to our heart's

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
content, until we've got something looking relatively

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
dynamic and exciting. In fact, I think that's getting...

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Well these two look too similar, I think. Well I suppose they would be, if they were falling

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
in the same direction, but let's just rotate this one around a bit more

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
there and move it there so it's a bit more

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
dynamic. That's great! This one here... In fact, let's

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
go a bit crazy! Let's just lift that one right up out of here, so it's going

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
absolutely flying. Well that's starting to look really good! And let's put this one

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
having a slight wobble. You see it's going into the floor there, we do need to watch

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that. So we can select it and just pull it back up again!

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Of course, because these things are moving, they can be slightly off of the ground, that's absolutely fine!

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And this one's obviously been impacted by the ball, because the ball's

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
inside it. So we can move that one over here, and just, again, play with it,

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
be more dynamic! The ball hasn't reached here yet,

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so that's absolutely fine! And then,

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we can look at it from various angles, and there we go, I think that's a pretty dynamic

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
scene! How did you guys get on? Please share in the discussions,

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,500
and I'll see you again soon!
