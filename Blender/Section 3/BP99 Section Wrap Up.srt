Hey guys, contratulations

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:07,133
on getting to the end of section 3! You've learned more about manipulating

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,133
meshes, you even learned how to create multiple layers of detail and had your very first

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,433
go with materials! What next for them, Mikey?! Well I'd like you

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:18,133
to go ahead and make your pin unique and remember to share it

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:22,133
with us in the discussions. And go back now, you've got a pyramid and

7
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:26,133
several other models we've gone through, have some fun with those and use the

8
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:29,466
skills you've already learned and apply those to the models.

9
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:33,133
Absolutely! So well done on getting this far! Why not dive straight into the

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,133
start of the next section, right now, and just to break that resistance to starting and

11
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,266
get the momentum. See you soon!

12
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:40,466
See you there!
