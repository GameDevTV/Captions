00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:06,033
Hi guys, welcome to this section where we're going to be making bowling pins

2
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:10,033
and a bowling ball! What are we going to cover? Well more complex meshes. The

3
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:14,033
whole idea here is that we step outside of our comfort zone again. You just got used to box modeling,

4
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:18,033
now we're going to introduce you to curvy things like bowling pins. How are they going to make

5
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:22,033
a bowling pin, Mikey? Well in this module, we're actually going to

6
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:26,033
suck in some reference material from a picture, so we're going to bring that into

7
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:30,033
Blender and use that to trace our model. So reference material,

8
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:34,033
real world reference material, that is a pretty handy technique! And then we're going to move on from there

9
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:38,033
and look at shading, a little bit of real world shading. Just basic stuff, we're just going to put a

10
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:42,033
red stripe, or whatever color stripe you want, around that bowling pin and show you how to

11
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:46,033
make different parts of your model appear different for the first time. So

12
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:50,033
we really want you to do that. In fact, maybe, Mikey, you can stress how much we want them to customize.

13
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:54,033
Yes, you could make anything. Make it your gnome!

14
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:58,033
Your gnome? Make the bowling pins gnomes!

15
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:02,033
It's an intentional slip of the tongue. You're going to make gnomes! You see what he did there, he's a really funny

16
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:06,033
guy. Make it your own, make it your gnome, garden gnome. You've got to make garden gnomes now!

17
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:10,033
I think they understand that. I think they've got it. O.K. so another thing that's

18
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:14,033
important is, we're going to be talking about the whole workflow in this section.

19
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:18,033
So I'm going to show you, at the end, how to export your model and then,

20
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:22,033
just as an example, how to import it into another package and I'm going to use Unity as the example, You

21
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:26,033
don't need to follow along. You don't need to download Unity, it's a very big package. If you've already got it,

22
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:30,033
sure. But you'll be able to see the impact of the way that you build your

23
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:34,033
model in Blender, and how that manifests itself over in a different package.

24
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:38,033
OK, and there are things to consider, like the scale of the model, like the rotation

25
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:42,033
of the model. The normals of the model. The normals, back to those old chestnuts.

26
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:46,033
Yes. And also, the way that your hierarchy of objects is arranged and named.

27
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:50,033
So all of that type of stuff is going to impact how it's exported,

28
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:54,033
and it's important to begin with the end in mind. Good old Stephen Coby... Coby? ...or even

29
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:58,033
Covey will tell you that. So that's what we're going to be doing! Yep! And always

30
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:02,033
remember to enjoy yourself throughout this entire section, and if you do have

31
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:06,033
questions, ask, and make sure you post your results in the discussions, so we can

32
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,066
see how you're getting on.
