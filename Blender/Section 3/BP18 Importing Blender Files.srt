00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,433
Welcome to Importing Blender Files!

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:06,433
In this video we'll be showing you how to import multiple

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:10,433
Blender files into a scene. We're going to be learning the difference

4
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:14,433
between append and linked and understanding that

5
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:18,433
a composited scene can exist with both types in it.

6
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:22,433
So appending! So this is great when making a

7
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:26,433
scene with multiple models. And note here that you have control

8
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:29,633
over the model, it's scale and position,

9
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:33,133
and you can edit the model. So it's like taking

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,133
a copy into the current Blender file. So a great

11
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:41,133
example of that would be a coffee table plus two cups, which

12
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:45,133
are just one .blend file backup, or indeed, you'd never

13
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:49,133
guess it, a bowling ball plus multiple pins! So let's have

14
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:53,133
a look at linked! Now, we're making an object

15
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:57,133
of components, so if it's one object that has multiple

16
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,133
components in it that make up this overall object.

17
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:05,133
So you do have no control over the model's position,

18
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:09,133
scale, etc., and you cannot edit

19
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:13,133
the model, it's done in the source file. So if you need to

20
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:17,133
adjust anything, when you link an object into your scene,

21
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:21,133
you have to change the actual .blend file itself and then

22
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:25,133
reopen the file and it'll come through. A great example there would be like

23
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:29,133
an anatomical model, where you've got a bone layout

24
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:33,133
and you want to add muscles on top. Well you can do the muscles in a separate

25
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:37,133
Blender file and move them in, etc. etc., into the right

26
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,200
position.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,966
Let's explore this now in Blender!

28
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:44,966
So here we are with the bowling ball we've created! Now the first

29
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:48,966
thing I will want to do is go over into the Outliner here and

30
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:52,966
just do a bit of tidying up, because we've still got items in here we don't

31
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:56,966
need, and we're working on this Icosphere. Well let's name that, straight away,

32
00:01:56,966 --> 00:02:00,966
BowlingBall, if you haven't done it already. If you have, well done! Cube,

33
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:04,966
well we're not using that anymore, so I'm going to delete that, and the same with Sphere.

34
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:08,966
So we've got a much more simplified model here. Now I'm going to go to

35
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:12,966
File and Save As, and I'm just going to make sure

36
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,400
that's saved in the right place for me.

37
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:20,033
There we go, so that is saved! Now,

38
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:24,033
we're going to open a brand new Blender file,

39
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:28,033
and the first thing we're going to do is, we're just going to setup a little stage

40
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:32,033
for this to work on. So I'm going to delete the

41
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:36,033
Cube that we have there, and then, I'm going to add a

42
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:40,033
Mesh and I'm just going to add a Plane. Ah that's quite small, at

43
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:44,033
the moment, so I'm just going to boost that up, let's say

44
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:48,033
16 on the Radius. So that's a nice floor plane for our stuff to

45
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,033
work on there, so there we go! Let's now

46
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:56,033
import one of those models! So let's import the bowling ball first of all!

47
00:02:56,033 --> 00:03:00,033
See to do that you'll want to go to File, and we've got our two

48
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:04,033
options down here, we've got Link and Append. Now,

49
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:08,033
in this case, if we Link all of this stuff in, it will appear at the origin

50
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:12,033
in the middle of our screen, because that's where the model was produced and

51
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:16,033
it will be of no use to us, so we are going to be using Append.

52
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:20,033
So you simply go to File, Append,

53
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,033
or you can use Shift and F1, and then, go find your file.

54
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:28,033
So mine is in my bowling assets folder. Now you

55
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:32,033
obviously will have setup a project folder and be working

56
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:36,033
from that, so go grab your Bowling Ball from there. Once you've clicked on

57
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:40,033
Bowling Ball, it's not opened it up, it's opened up this new

58
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:44,033
hierarchy, so a .blend file is a container file of

59
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:48,033
lots of other Blender objects, settings, etc. as you can see down there.

60
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:52,200
And we want Object, so click on

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Object, and there's our Bowling Ball. And if we hadn't renamed

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,200
it, that would have said Icosphere and there would have Cube and UV

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Sphere or just Sphere down here, as well. So we want Bowling Ball, you can double-click that,

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
or just click here and then click Append from Library up here, there's the

65
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Bowling Ball in our scene! Now it's come in on the origin. I'm just going to

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,200
shift it over now, because the next thing I'm going to ask you to do

67
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,200
is import the pin. So it's challenge

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,400
time!

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,400
It's time to Import the Bowling Pin! So go ahead now

70
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,400
and import the pin, and do make sure that your bowling ball

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,400
and pin are the same relative scale.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
So pause the video now and go give that a go!

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,400
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop straight

74
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,333
on over into Blender!

75
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,333
Right, so let's get this pin into our scene! So I'm going to

76
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,333
go to File, Append. Now, I'm already

77
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,333
here, I'm just going to click up one, because I know... Ooh, and again

78
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:59,333
and there's my Bowling Pin. So now that's in our...

79
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,333
There Object and Pin. Append from Library.

80
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,333
So we can see here that the ball and the pin

81
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,333
are at different scales. In fact, I think the

82
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,333
bowling ball itself, because of my mistake earlier,

83
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,333
is just over twice the size. Instead of making it a

84
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,333
Diameter of 2.16, I made it a

85
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:27,333
Radius of 2.6. So my mistake, but we'll go

86
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:31,333
ahead and correct that now. Now we have two options, if we knew

87
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,333
we were going to use this ball over and over and over again, then what

88
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,333
we'd want to do is edit the initial .blend file

89
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,833
of the bowling ball itself, otherwise

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
we could edit it in the scene as well. So because we've appended it, we can just

91
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
multiply it by a scale factor to bring it back to the right amount.

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,500
I'm going to do things quite properly, because there's a good chance that I'll want

93
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,500
to use this bowling ball at some other point, in either this course

94
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
or in a game I'm producing or something else. I don't want to have to keep remembering

95
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,500
to rescale it. So I'm going to Save my file

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,500
now, and I'm going to call this

97
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Bowling Alley. Why not, it's descriptive of what we're doing.

98
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,500
And just save that file. Great! I'm now going

99
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,500
to go back to my original bowling ball.

100
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,500
There we go! And we're going to have to change the scaling on

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,500
this. Now, I've already done the math and the basic

102
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,500
scale here, because... Oh, I don't want calendar, I want

103
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,500
calculator. ...we have a bowling ball that

104
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
is 2.6 in diameter, it should have been in radius. So

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,500
we can already sort of guess we're going to be multiplying it by something like 0.5 to half

106
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,500
the size, but the proper radius it should have been is...

107
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Well Diameter was 2.16 and

108
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,500
this is going to be 1.08.

109
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,500
So we need to do 1.08, which is

110
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,500
our size we want it to be, and the size it currently is is

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,500
2.6, so I'm going to divide that by 2.6.

112
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
And we can see there, I need to scale this by a factor

113
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
of 0.415. I'm not going to worry about the other bits

114
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,066
involved there, so 0.415. OK,

115
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,800
so scale with the S key. Oh, that's selected first!

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Scale with the S key. Excellent! And

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,800
then, we need to just go 0.415

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Enter, and we're going to

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,800
save that now. So that's over it in the bowling ball, and it's now the right

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,800
relative size to the other model. Now, I'm going to go File,

121
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,800
definitely saved it, and I'm going to go Open and go to our Bowling

122
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Alley. And you'll notice that this hasn't changed and that's because it's

123
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
appended and not linked. So I'm just going to Delete that from our

124
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
scene, and I'm going to go File, Append,

125
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,800
go up up, and go to our Bowling Ball,

126
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,800
and go to Object, go to Bowling Ball, and Append

127
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,800
from Library. Now if you got the scaling right the first time,

128
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,800
unlike me, then you wouldn't have to go though that. But there are

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,466
going to be times when you

130
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,266
mess up your scale, at some point.

131
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:26,266
Don't worry! And in this case, the bowling ball was so simple we could almost go back

132
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:30,266
and model it again, but that's not always going to be the case. You're going to come

133
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:34,266
across a, you've spent hours and hours doing something and it's one and a

134
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:38,266
half times too big or something silly like that. Don't worry, you can always scale it

135
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:42,266
back down. This is a 3D Modeling package, you can do anything! OK,

136
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:46,266
so that's our scene basically setup there! We need to

137
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:49,433
do a few more things, and we'll do that in the next lecture. Now,

138
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:53,866
go ahead and share in the discussions how you got on, and I will see

139
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,700
you in the next lecture! Take care!
