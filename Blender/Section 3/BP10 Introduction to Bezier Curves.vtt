00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Hey welcome back, it's Ben here! Remember you can

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.300
always slow the video down, because I talk a little bit faster than Mikey. So

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.300
I'm going to be introducing what are Bezier Curves. We'll be telling you why

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.300
we're using them for our pin, and then, you'll be drawing your first Bezier Curve!

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.300
So what are Bezier Curves? They are perfect mathematical vector

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.300
curves. They can be scaled infinitely with no loss of detail,

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.300
and that means that you can create a very simple, smooth, and elegant look

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.300
but only if you use as few as possible. Let's just

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.300
click on to this Wikipedia article in your notes, to show you. A couple of

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.300
examples of Bezier Curves, there's one on the right there. If I scroll past all the math,

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.300
you can see some others moving here. They're defined, basically, by a start point,

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.300
an end point, and then, these blue control handles in

13
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.300
this diagram. And between those start points, end points, and control handles, you've got

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.300
fantastic control over the shape of your curve, so let's go

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.300
and see how we do this in Blender. Here's where Mikey left you, looking

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.300
at the front view of your pin, with a cube there in the scene at

17
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.300
the origin, and what I want to do, firstly, is just scale that cube!

18
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.300
In the X direction, we want the cube 1.2 units

19
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.300
like that. So now we have two forms of reference, we have a bounding

20
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.300
box of the cube sitting there in the scene, and then, we have, of course, this background

21
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.300
image that we've setup. Fantastic! I'm just going to move

22
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.300
this 3D View over the top of the Timeline View, like that,

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.300
dragging downwards just to give myself some more screen space. So

24
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.300
without further ado, let's add a Bezier Curve so you can see what it does! There's three ways

25
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.300
of doing that. One is from the Create menu, you can click here

26
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.300
Curve, Bezier. Or you could do the Shift A for add and that would bring

27
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.300
up your Add menu and you''ll find a Curve menu, or you could go to the

28
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.300
Add menu, down at the bottom here and that's actually the same menu upside down for some reason.

29
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.300
Fantastic! So let's add ourselves a Bezier Curve,

30
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.300
but before you click away anywhere else, remember when you first create things in Blender you want to

31
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.300
be a little bit careful down on the bottom-left here. And remember, if this pane's not showing you

32
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.300
can make it show with the little plus sign. So if you've pulled that

33
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.300
all the way down, like I do all the time, that little plus sign will bring it back up. So

34
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.300
before you submit this curve to having been created, make sure you

35
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Align with View. The reason for that is, in our case, we want to make a

36
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.300
curve purely in the X, Z plane, we don't want it

37
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.300
extending in Y at all. OK, we want a 2 dimensional Bezier Curve, they

38
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.300
can be 3D in Blender. So there you go, you have this squiggly thing here which

39
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.300
you can drag around with the Right Mouse Button. When you do, you'll notice it

40
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.300
goes right through, in 3 dimenstions, the middle of that reference cube.

41
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.300
So we can sort that out by just moving the reference cube backwards.

42
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.300
Click on your cube up here in your top-right in

43
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.300
the outline, and then, just push it in Y

44
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.300
until it's behind the Bezier Curve. Fantastic! Now, let's select the Bezier Curve

45
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.300
again! Here it is, there's your curve! Now, I want you to make sure that your Bezier

46
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.300
Curve, when you first crete it, is at Y equals 0. This is very important!

47
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.300
Once it's selected and created at Y equals 0, push Tab

48
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.300
or go to Edit mode, both do the same thing. Now,

49
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.300
you have control over those things you saw on Wikipedia! You can right-click

50
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.300
the end point and drag and move it around. Now you see that it's moving

51
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.300
in X and Y. It looks like it's moving in X and Y,

52
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.300
that is because we have Local coordinates selected, you need to be in Global coordinates.

53
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.300
Blender is very confusing in a 2D view, because it actually changes this X,

54
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.300
Y to X, Z. Sorry, this X, Z to X, Y! That's very

55
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.300
confusing. So let's be in Global coordinates! Now, when you drag

56
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.300
around your end point, you'll see the Y is not changing or as good as not changing, the last decimal

57
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.300
place moves a little bit. So sue me, that's OK! Let's also

58
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.300
click on there with the Right Button, on the start point, and move it around and see how it works!

59
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.300
If you missed the start point you may grab a control handle like I did. That's fine! So

60
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.300
the things that you can control are the start and end points here, by dragging with

61
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.300
the Right Mouse Button, Left Button to place and the same

62
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.300
with the handles. You right-click and drag to move the handle, and then, you left-click to

63
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300
place. The final thing you're going to need to know about this curve is how to

64
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.300
add new vertex control points. How do you do that? Well

65
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.300
you click on the last one, like here, the end one,

66
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.300
and then, you hold down Control and left-click the Mouse Button.

67
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.300
So you hold down Control and left-click with the final end point selected,

68
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.300
and that will create another point afterwards. And again, you can go in and

69
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.300
grab and drag these handles. Again, keep an eye, up at the Transform, that this is all

70
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.300
in the Y equals 0. So what we're going to do is we're going to outline

71
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.300
the right-hand side of the pin. I'm going to start it for you, and then, I'm going to challenge you to finish it.

72
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.300
Let's put the first control point up at the top here, place

73
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.300
it roughly, that's fine. Roughly drag the control points

74
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.300
around to where we want them, something like that, and now let's

75
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.300
go place that first point precisely. I want it at X equals

76
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.300
0, right in the middle of the pin. I want it at Y equals 0, in the plane of the screen, and at

77
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.300
Z equals 1.9, precisely at the top of the pin.

78
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.300
Now, here comes the art of drawing Bezier Curves! Where do you place the next node?

79
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.300
Where are we going to move this guy to? There's lots of places you could put it,

80
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.300
but I'm going to choose to put it right here, where the next of the pin becomes vertical.

81
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.300
And let me explain the rule of thumb that I've got for

82
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.300
why I'm putting that point here. We want as few

83
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.300
points as possible in a Bezier Curve, to keep it as simple as possible.

84
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.300
Every point we add to the curve introduces complexity

85
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.300
and takes away from the mathematical purity and elegance of that curve,

86
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.300
so you want to use as few as possible. Now, if you were driving a car around this

87
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.300
pin, around the outside of this pin, let's start on the left-hand neck here.

88
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.300
Here we are steering right, steering right, steering right, and at the top, our steering wheel goes

89
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.300
vertical. Imagine you've got a piece of white tape on a rally car steering wheel, this is an indication

90
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.300
you need to put a new control vertex in. Now, we're steering right, steering right,

91
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.300
steering right, and at this point, our steering wheel's gone vertical again

92
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.300
and now the control point. Alright, now as I scroll down

93
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.300
I am now steering left, steering left, steering left from the

94
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.300
car's point of view, and at this point, I inflect and I go

95
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.300
through and I start steering right. So you might want to put yourself another control point

96
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.300
here and then get the handles

97
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.300
where you want them. OK.

98
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.300
Or you might decide, I don't need one there. I can go all the way down

99
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.300
to here, because this is the first time that the

100
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.300
curve changes direction, because actually here, all of the time we're steering

101
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.300
right, steering right, steering right, steering right. You see? So this is a really subtle point,

102
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.300
it's very tempting to put a control point here, so that we can precisely

103
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.300
define the width of the curve, but the disadvantage of doing that is, it's actually

104
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.300
one more than we need. We only actually need a control point

105
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.300
here, because this is the next time the steering wheel goes vertical, and by dragging these

106
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.300
handles, you can get around that curve. OK, so I've

107
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.300
nearly done that for you now. Now, if you accidentally do what I've just done and go into

108
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.300
3D View, not a problem, check that your curve is flat in 3D, and then, just come back to

109
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.300
Front view. So I've shown you most of it, but I want you to finish this off and

110
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.300
get it to spec, to specifications. So let's show you the spec slide!

111
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.300
Finish the pin outline, only one half of the pin is needed. The top control

112
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.300
vertex should be at precisely (0, 0, 1.9).

113
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.300
The bottom one should be at 0, so it's in the middle of the pin, 0 in

114
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.300
Y so it's in the plane of the screen, and -1.9

115
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.300
so it's precisely at the bottom of the pin. I want you to add

116
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.966
just one more control vertex, actually,

117
00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.866
for a total of four, and then, make sure that

118
00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:47.866
all the vertices have a Y = 0 and see if you can get a good outline from

119
00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:51.866
that. So pause the video, see if you can outline the pin in four vertices total!

120
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.533
OK welcome back! So

121
00:07:57.533 --> 00:08:01.533
adding in these final vertices! We firstly need to select, carefully,

122
00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:05.533
our end point. So make sure you're selected on the Bezier Curve, then you come in here,

123
00:08:05.533 --> 00:08:09.533
and right-click on the actual final control point.

124
00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:13.533
And then, these handles are really long, so I'm actually going to pull this

125
00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:17.533
handle in a bit, before I even add another point. Then, we

126
00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:21.533
hold down Control and left-click at the bottom, and there's my final point! Now, it all looks a bit funny

127
00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:25.533
in there right now, but that's OK, let's sort it out, let's grab the handles, and take control of this curve.

128
00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:29.533
So there's one, click, and then,

129
00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:33.533
here's the other handle, click. Now, you need to mess around a little

130
00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:37.533
bit, because Bezier Curves are very holistic, when you make a change to one part of the curve

131
00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:41.533
it changes the rest. But here are the things that are important! Number one, this bottom

132
00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:45.533
control point needs to be at precisely at 0, 0,

133
00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:49.533
-1.9 for when Mikey spins it around in 3D with you.

134
00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:53.533
This may be a good time to check your top control point is at precisely 0,

135
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:57.533
0, +1.9. Fantastic! Next thing I want you to check is that

136
00:08:57.533 --> 00:09:01.533
the top of the pin is going to be actually flat, and the way to check that is that this

137
00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:05.533
right-hand handle here also needs to have a Z value. Whatever

138
00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:09.533
you choose for X is up to you, that's by eye, but it must have a Z

139
00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:13.533
value of precisely 1.9. OK, so then it's completely

140
00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:17.533
flat at the top. Coming down the curve it looks OK for now, we'll modify it in

141
00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:21.533
a minute. And we have a change of direction here, so we need

142
00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:25.533
to grab this control point and make this curve how we want it. It doesn't have

143
00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:29.533
to perfectly match this reference pin, by the way. And then,

144
00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:33.533
this handle here will adjust the curvature at the bottom. Remember the pin needs to be able to stand up,

145
00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:37.533
so you actually want quite a flat bottom, so I'm going to make this handle quite long,

146
00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:41.533
watching the entire curve as I do it. And the same treatment

147
00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:45.533
at the bottom. This bottom control vertex must be at 0, 0, -1.9,

148
00:09:45.533 --> 00:09:49.533
but importantly, it's right-hand handle must also be

149
00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:53.533
at -1.9 in the Z, then you have a

150
00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:57.533
completely flat curve at the bottom. So I'm leaving my pin different

151
00:09:57.533 --> 00:10:01.533
to the reference pin, because I want a squarer bottom on it OK, because I

152
00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:05.533
want it to be able to stand up a little bit better. So the final thing that I'm going to adjust here is

153
00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:09.533
the handles on this one at the neck. And

154
00:10:09.533 --> 00:10:13.533
look at that, that's pretty cool! When you're satisfied with your pin, then

155
00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:17.533
you can come out of Edit Mode, back into Object Mode, and I'm actually going to

156
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:21.533
turn off the Background Image now, because it's kind of distracting

157
00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:25.533
me. There you go that's my pin outline, and

158
00:10:25.533 --> 00:10:29.533
I think it looks pretty good! So what we're going to do next with Michael is

159
00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:33.533
rotate that around 360 degrees and create you a full

160
00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:37.533
three dimensional pin, from this pretty curve. So congratulations, and I'll

161
00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:38.933
see you soon!
