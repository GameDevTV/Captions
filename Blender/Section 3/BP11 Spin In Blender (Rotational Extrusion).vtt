00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.133
Welcome to Spin in Blender or Rotational

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.133
Extrusion! So in this video we're going to

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:12.133
convert the curve that we've made into a mesh object. We're going

4
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:16.133
to learn that a curve is still infinitely editable, and

5
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:20.133
using the Spin Tool we will make our pin. So let's

6
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.533
hop over into Blender!

7
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:26.533
Welcome back into Blender! So we have our curve

8
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.533
all there and sorted. Now I'm quite happy to get rid of our

9
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:34.533
cube that we made earlier, as our reference cube, as we're not going to

10
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:38.533
need it anymore, in this case. So I'm going to select that and just get rid of it

11
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:42.533
completely. OK, we've got our Bezier Curve

12
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.533
here, which is great, and I'm going to go over to the Outliner here

13
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.533
and just name our Bezier Curve something more descriptive, like

14
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:54.533
Pin Outline. It's very important you keep this naming

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.266
throughout your production, because when you're

16
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:01.266
models get more complicated, you're not going to be able to find anything. Right!

17
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:05.266
So we need to convert this into a mesh object,

18
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:09.266
and you can do that by going down to Object,

19
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.366
and, in my case, I'm going to have to scroll up a little.

20
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.066
There we go! Convert to...

21
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:19.066
And we can see the shortcut key there is Alt and C, and we want to

22
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:23.066
make a Mesh from a Curve, so we're going to

23
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:27.066
select that. And we can see, over in the Outliner, that it's created

24
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:31.066
a mesh object, that icon there has changed. Now in

25
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:35.066
case you wanted to keep the original data, the curve, you can

26
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:39.066
opt down here in the operator panel to

27
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:43.066
keep the original, and then, we can see we get Pin Outline

28
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:47.066
and Pin Outline 001 and one is a mesh object.

29
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:51.066
Now I'm going to go straight into that, because I know that this mesh object is about

30
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:55.066
to just become our pin. So there we go,

31
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:59.066
we've converted that curve straight into

32
00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:03.066
a mesh. Now we've left the curve there, the curve is infinitely

33
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:07.066
editable, it's a mathematical calculation, which is great!

34
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:11.066
Once we've created a mesh

35
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:15.066
out of it, it essentially becomes solidified, as we mentioned, and if

36
00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:18.733
I hide the pin outline, by clicking on the little

37
00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:21.900
eye icon there, we can see

38
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.900
that our pin itself is now made up of, if we hop in to

39
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.900
select it first hop into Edit Mode, it's made up of a

40
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.900
series of vertices. If we highlight the entire lot,

41
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.900
because we're going to need that in a moment, we can then perform some

42
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900
operations on it. So for instance, if that was just something we want

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.900
to extrude out, we could do that straight away, which is great! But we want to

44
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.900
rotationally extrude, how do we do that? Well

45
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.900
once we're in Edit Mode and we've selected all of the geometry

46
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.900
we want to manipulate, in this case it's everything, we can go

47
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.900
Tools on the Tool Shelf, scroll down a little if you can't see it already,

48
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.900
and click straight on Spin, and we can see the shortcut there is

49
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.900
Alt and R. So by pressing Alt and R, we

50
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.900
perform a Spin. Now, that doesn't look anything

51
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.900
like our pin! So

52
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.900
why? Well we're going to have to look down in the Operator Panel, so I'm just going to

53
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.900
make this a bit bigger, because there are a few more options here, and let's

54
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.866
go down them one by one. Steps is the number of

55
00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:32.666
steps there are. It increases, the more steps you have the more detailed

56
00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:36.666
it becomes. Now, it's quite a cool shape but it's not a pin!

57
00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:40.666
Angle, well that is the angle at which it goes around. In fact,

58
00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:44.666
it looks like some sort of funky wheel or break disc or plate, at the moment, which is

59
00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:48.666
great, and obviously, you rotate all the way around until you meet 360. That's fine!

60
00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:52.666
The center, well the center moves

61
00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:56.666
each individual part of the rotation, and we actually

62
00:03:56.666 --> 00:04:00.666
just want everything here at 0. So if it's not at 0, do set it

63
00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:01.866
at 0 now.

64
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.033
Alright, now everything's at

65
00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:08.033
0! It's still not quite right, we need to play with these axes down

66
00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:12.033
here, and we're not rotating it in any way on the X and Y,

67
00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:16.033
so we can definitely delete that and we have a pin

68
00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:20.033
shape. Excellent! It's only

69
00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:24.033
42 degrees of a pin but none the less that's always good!

70
00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:28.033
Right, 160 degrees! Sorry, I was reading the wrong thing there!

71
00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:31.566
Steps 42, Angle 160! That's great!

72
00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:35.566
OK, it's challenge time! I'd like you guys to finish the pin!

73
00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:39.566
So go ahead and finish off the pin and consider the

74
00:04:39.566 --> 00:04:43.566
following please. I'd like you to remove any doubles that are created

75
00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:47.566
during the process. Get the normals the right way around, because

76
00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:51.566
there's a chance that they will be the wrong way around. So there's a little hint

77
00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:55.566
there for you! And finally, set the base of the pin on the XY Plane,

78
00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:59.566
just to finish it off, and that's where Z=0. So go ahead,

79
00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:03.566
pause the video now, and give that a go!

80
00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:07.566
OK welcome back! Let's hop back over into Blender!

81
00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:12.666
So over in Blender... Well straight away I know I want

82
00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:16.666
360 degrees, so I'm just going to wack that in straight away,

83
00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:20.666
and I'm just going to have a look at my pin and just adjust this Z value

84
00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:24.666
to... You see, that's normals that are the wrong way around, and that's

85
00:05:24.666 --> 00:05:28.666
normals that are the right way around! So it's quite a distinctive color change, and

86
00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:32.666
eye will tune into that very quickly. So now we've got that the right way

87
00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:36.666
around. I do want to change our Steps, I think that's a few too many steps, actually.

88
00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:40.666
I think that's over the top, so I'm just going to lower that down.

89
00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:44.666
Now 16's a bit too low, 32

90
00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:48.666
a bit high. I want to go for, in the middle of that, 24!

91
00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:52.666
Yeah, there we go! I'm happy with that! Now, one thing to bear in

92
00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:56.666
mind is, because we've gone around at a whole 360 degrees

93
00:05:56.666 --> 00:06:00.666
there will be a series of duplicate vertices actually, along

94
00:06:00.666 --> 00:06:04.666
this seem that we can see, where we started from, because it also put a

95
00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:08.666
layer down when we finished. So we need to just select our

96
00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:12.666
entire model, ensuring there's no further doubles,

97
00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:16.666
and on the Tool Shelf I'm just going to Remove Doubles, as we've done before. And we can see I've actually

98
00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:20.666
removed 120 vertices, at that point, so there was a

99
00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:24.666
bit of mess in our model there but now it's all gone! Excellent!

100
00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:28.366
So the one thing left to do then, in our model,

101
00:06:28.366 --> 00:06:32.366
is just lift it up so it's actually on the X Y plane. So I'm simply going

102
00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:36.366
to grab it, I'm going to lock it to the Z axis so it's still in the middle,

103
00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:40.366
and, if I believe, it's 1.9, and that should make us

104
00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:44.366
all the way up there. I'm just going to change the view to the Front

105
00:06:44.366 --> 00:06:48.366
and there we go! Yeah, I'm happy, that looks like it's bang on the bottom and it is! And

106
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.100
there we go! There's our pin!

107
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.966
Remember to share this in the discussions, so I can

108
00:06:53.966 --> 00:06:57.966
see what you guys have been up to, and I shall see you in the next lecture!
