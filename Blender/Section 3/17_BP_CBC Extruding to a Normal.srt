1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Extruding to a Normal!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video we are basically going to change the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
axis for extrusion, for finer control.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So let's hop over into Blender and play with that now!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,800


6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,800
So the first thing that we can do here is, we can correct my

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,800
obviously deliberate mistake of this extrusion into

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,800
our model. Now fortunately, it looks like it

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
has gone down and through the center of our model.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,800
So how do we make sure that we can pull it back out

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,800
and line it up here? Well there are a couple of ways to that, but one of the easiest

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,800
ways is, once we have these

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,800
six faces selected, they combine all as

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,800
one to generate a normal, a common normal, which is

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,800
actually the same as the vertex normal in the middle here. It'll be pointing

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,800
upwards, so towards us. Now down

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,800
here with the 3D Manipulator Widget, that we've played with in the past,

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,800
you can change that from where it says Global

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,800
to a couple of other things, one of which is Normal.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Now, if we change that to Normal, and I'm

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,800
surprised we can't see the blue one anymore because it's pointing right at us.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,800
So the normal coming out of this vertex,

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
in the middle, is facing right towards us. So if we rotate around

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,800
we can see, there it is. And what we can do at this point is,

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,800
we can literally pull that back up and that will be perfectly

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,800
in line. So we can move it up or down, as much as

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
we want. Now, bowling balls have holes going inwards, so going out is no good,

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,800
but what we can do, [Laughs] at this point, is go ahead

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,800
and select the Snapping Tool, select

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
the... I don't really care which one we do it to, we can just

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,800
align it with a Face, and this time, when we move it backwards

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
and forwards, we can hover over a particular face we want to align it

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
with. And I don't think face is actually going to be the right one in this

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
case. I'm pretty sure that is now aligned, but I can't be 100%

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,800
sure, unless it's really to a

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Vertex. Let's do Vertex instead! So again, let's

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,800
move it up and down, and snapping, that is definitely

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,800
the right place now. Now because we've moved it all the way down and brought it back

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
again, that would have produced a series of doubles. So before we do

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,800
anything else, I'm going to now push it into our model

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,800
to a certain level

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,800
and that is 1 Blender unit.

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
So let's push that in now, by 1 Blender unit, so

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,800
that is -1 in the Z axis. And I'm going to turn Snapping

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,800
off. There we go! So if I type

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,800
-1, have I lost the opportunity to do that? Yes I have!

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,800
So let's grab that and move it in the Z axis.

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,800
And remember, that will now be moving in the Z axis, that

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
is normal because that's what we've set.

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
In fact, at this point, I'm just going to undo to here.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,800
So we're going to move that, not extrude in this case. The other

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
ones we will extrude, but this has already been extruded and it's just on top of one another

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,800
and in the Z axis by -1. And that should go inside

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
our model and it hasn't!

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,800
You see it's moved in the wrong Z axis. So along

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
here, have we got the orientation? So in the Operator Panel,

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
is Orientation that's currently set to Global. So

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
because we used to shortcut keys it's assumed something different

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,800
to what's down here. So if we change orientation back

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,800
to Normal it will go in and, in this case, exactly what

61
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,800
we want, in towards the center of our

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,566
sphere.

63
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:03,532
That

64
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,533
doesn't look quite the right depth, so I'm just going to

65
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:11,533
increase that a little to 1.5, and because I haven't gone

66
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:15,533
off of this yet, I can set that Z Constraint there to

67
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:19,533
-1.5. I think that will be better!

68
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:23,533
So let's go and do a challenge!

69
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,233


70
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:28,233
It's challenge time! I'd like you to create the remaining finger holes.

71
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:32,233
So use the circles that we have created,

72
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:36,233
extrude them along the Normal Z Axis,

73
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:40,233
and then, set them to a depth

74
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,233
of 1.5 Blender units. Pause the

75
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:48,233
video now and give that a go!

76
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:52,233
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop over into Blender

77
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,633
and complete our bowling ball!

78
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:58,633
OK, so we've successfully done that bowling

79
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:02,633
ball there. Let's go up to the top here, and

80
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:06,633
I can see straight away we've got one thing to do to our circles.

81
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:10,633
We need to inset them a little, before we actually

82
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:14,633
do anything else, so let's go ahead and do that

83
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:18,633
straight away. We can grab them both, so they're inset by

84
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:22,633
the same amount, and inset them, it doesn't have to be much.

85
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:23,899
And there we go!  

86
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,900
...Now I'm about to say something isn't possible,

87
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,900
where is in fact, it IS possible, but not with the knowledge that we've learnt so far

88
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,900
So, you can extrude both of these faces if you

89
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,900
change the pivot point to Individual Origins and

90
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,900
have the Gimbal set to Normal. That would then work

91
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,900
absolutely fine.  We're going to do it individually since we don't actually possess   

92
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,300
that knowledge just yet!

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,033
 So now we're ready to do this! I know the extrusion

94
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:57,033
itself will not work, if we try and do them both at

95
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:01,033
once, because it will take a normal that's between these

96
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:05,033
two points, instead of the points themselves. So we're going to have to

97
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:09,033
select the faces themselves. It's

98
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:09,999
selected on Normal,

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,033
and I can just extrude, make

100
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:16,033
sure we are extruding and start to push it in. Now I can see that,

101
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:20,033
in the lower-left, it says it's

102
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:24,033
moving on the Normal. We can see that

103
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:28,033
straight away, it's done that by default which is great! And we can

104
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:32,033
set that, immediately, to -1.5.

105
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:36,033
And there we go, that's inside our pin!

106
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:40,033
So let's select these ones here, as well,

107
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:44,033
and it was set to Normal here, so if we press E this is also

108
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:48,033
going to extrude along a normal. This is brilliant! And let's set that to

109
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:52,033
-1.5. Now there is a chance that

110
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:56,033
these two will cross one another. So there we go! So a design

111
00:06:56,033 --> 00:07:00,033
problem with our specs, straight away, is that the holes

112
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:04,033
themselves, these two, as they move in are going

113
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:08,033
to hit one another. But it doesn't look like the overlap is

114
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:12,033
that much, so, in this case, I'm going to simply

115
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:16,033
pull one of these back out, until they're not touching anymore.

116
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:20,033
So I'm going to grab that bottom, I'm going to move it in the Z axis,

117
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:24,033
but not the global Z axis, I don't want that.

118
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:28,033
I want to move it on this axis here, so I'm

119
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:32,033
just going to grab that instead and just pull it up ever so slightly. I can't see

120
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:32,966
what I'm doing.

121
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,832
We don't want geometry crossing, that's bad

122
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,833
bad bad. And there we go! So a

123
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,833
consideration there if someone gives you a spec that has a

124
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,833
fault in it. Do mention it to the person as quickly as

125
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,333
possible. I've already mentioned it to myself.

126
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,733
Let's do the final thing now and hop into

127
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:54,766


128
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,866
Object Mode and look around our model, and that

129
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:01,866
looks absolutely fine! In fact, that doesn't look too far

130
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:04,466
apart now, that's looks absolutely fine!

131
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:07,732
Right, so the final thing that we will do on

132
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:11,733
this bowling ball is give it some color, it's looking a bit bland at the moment!

133
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:15,733
So let's go into our material properties

134
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:19,733
and add a new material slot, create a new material,

135
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,733
and I'm going to call it, very imaginatively, BowlingBall.

136
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:27,733
Now, I'm going to scroll down here on Diffuse,

137
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:31,733
I'm going to change that. What color should I have it? Why not

138
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,733
a yellow, a bright yellow color. Great! So there we go, we've got

139
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:39,733
our bowling ball all colored in. I'm going to make sure I remember to

140
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:43,733
Save that as well, very important. And that's ready to

141
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:47,733
use wherever you want to use it! Now, some of you may be thinking, well

142
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:51,733
I've seen bowling balls and they're sparkly or they've got textures on them or

143
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:55,733
words, etc. Don't worry about that, for the moment, in the next couple of sections,

144
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:59,733
we'll be going into much more detail with our models.

145
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:03,733
But do remember, the skills that you've learned so far, you can now go back

146
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:07,733
and practice, you know, color in the models that you've already made and saved in

147
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:14,633
your project folders. So that's great, and I will see you guys again

148
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:14,666
soon! Take care!

149
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,666
