00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,300
Hi it's Michael again! Welcome to

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,300
Creating Collider Meshes! So in this video I will show you

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,300
how to control the number of vertices and we can do that

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,300
in a couple of ways. Firstly, we'll be creating a

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,300
Convex Hull, so the collision mesh works properly,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,300
and we'll be introducing the Decimate modifier.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,866
So let's hop straight on over into Blender!

8
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:31,866
So here we are in Blender! And the first thing to

9
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:35,866
realize is that what we're about to do is destructive.

10
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:39,866
So we've got a couple of options how to move forward. We can

11
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:43,866
either create a duplicate of our pin and then work on that

12
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,866
mesh, or we can create a whole new file. So in this

13
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:51,866
case, I'm going to create a whole new file just to keep things simple, so we don't

14
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:55,866
have multiple models in our scene. And

15
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:59,866
also, so when we look at the Info Pane, at the top here, we can

16
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:03,866
see the number of vertices and we can just read that out and know that we've met

17
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:07,866
our design requirements. So I'm going to go to File,

18
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:11,866
Save As, and I'm going to save it as

19
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:15,866
BowlingPinCollider! An imaginative name, as you can imagine!

20
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:19,866
So, at the top here, I can confirm that's the case, BowlingPinCollider!

21
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:23,866
Excellent! So the first thing I'm going to do is make sure this is simple, because when

22
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:27,866
Ben imports it or when we export it to any other package,

23
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:31,866
we need to make sure that we don't put in a load of other gumf as well,

24
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:35,866
So really, some of these things in the Outliner can go.

25
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:39,866
So we can get rid of the Camera, we don't really care about that, in this case.

26
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,866
The Lamp can also go and the Pin Outline can go.

27
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:47,866
Secondly, I'm not interested in any materials,

28
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:51,866
because this is literally a collision mesh, it's not going to be seen by anything, So, in this case,

29
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,866
I'm going to delete those two materials, and I'm going to check in this

30
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,866
here that they've got a 0 against them. Great, so we know

31
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:03,866
I've just reassigned it, so I'm going to get rid of that again. That means that,

32
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:07,866
on the save and reopen, those materials will go.

33
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:11,866
So now we've got our basic pin down. The first thing

34
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:15,866
we're going to do is actually make the whole of our shape,

35
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:19,866
our model here, convex. And we can do that in

36
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:23,866
two ways, and the first way is hopping over into Edit

37
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:27,866
Mode, selecting all of the model that we will

38
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:31,866
want to adjust, going to Mesh,

39
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:35,866
Vertices, and then, up here we have

40
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:39,866
Convex Hull. Now the other way of getting

41
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:43,866
to that point is, in the 3D window here, if we press the

42
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:47,866
spacebar, we... Oh, it looks like that was the last thing I searched for!

43
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:51,866
But we can type in here an action we want to perform, and

44
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:55,866
in this case, Convex Hull is in there and we can just press Enter. And it

45
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:59,866
makes our model convex immediately, so we've got no more

46
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:03,866
of the pin neck coming in. And we can take a quick

47
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:07,866
look at the number of vertices to see that it has dropped, and it's dropped

48
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:11,866
down to 482, so we're not quite at our

49
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:15,866
256 limit yet. So the next thing that we can do is start

50
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:19,866
simplifying our geometry. Now we could go in manually and start doing that, but there is

51
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,866
a tool called the Decimate Modifier that will do that for us.

52
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:27,866
So if we go over to our wrench over here or spanner,

53
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:31,866
we can Add a Modifier, and we have here,

54
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:35,866
on the second column, the Generate column, Decimate. Now,

55
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:39,866
if you click that and we start playing with the

56
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:43,866
Un-Subdivide, it's a nice one to look at because

57
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:47,866
it's easy to see and visualize how it breaks up our geometry.

58
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:51,866
And if we increase the Iterations, nothing happens!

59
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:55,866
Why does nothing happen? Well two fold, number one, we're not in

60
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:59,866
Object Mode, so let's hop back over into Object Mode! Oh, and that looks a bit

61
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:03,866
funny, so let's bring the Iterations back down to 0 again. So we've got our

62
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:07,866
basic pin shape here, once more. Now we do want to change the Shading

63
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:11,866
back to Flat and the reason for that is so we can see what's going on.

64
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:15,866
So we can see here, with iterations, we can increase that and

65
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:19,866
the model gets simpler and simpler. So what I'd like you

66
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:22,733
to do now is a little challenge.

67
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,133
I would like you to create our

68
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:29,133
collider mesh. So remember we've got a hard limit of 256

69
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:33,133
vertices. Ensure, if you've not done it already, that it is a convex

70
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:37,133
model, and finally, the base must be flat. There must be something

71
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:41,133
for it so it stands up. So hop into Blender

72
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:45,133
now, pause the video, and complete this task!

73
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:49,133
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop

74
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:52,100
over into Blender and do those tasks!

75
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,566
So the first thing is deciding how many

76
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:59,566
Un-Subdivides we are going to do. So if we

77
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,566
increase our Iterations we can see that, at one point,

78
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:07,566
it becomes totally unusable. At

79
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:11,566
5 iterations that's complete garbage, so let's reduce

80
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:15,566
that and see what happens in the rest of them. So here I

81
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:19,566
think this looks like this maintains the original width really well. So

82
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:23,566
a 0 that's fine, we've got the original width. At

83
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:27,566
1 we've got the original width. At 2 we've still got the original width,

84
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:31,566
but it starts from 3 and above getting thinner.

85
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:35,566
Now that's not going to be any good if we've got a bowling ball hitting a

86
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:39,566
pin. In fact, the bowling ball would end up going inside the pin

87
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:43,566
and hitting the collider beneath the surface. So looking at this, I think

88
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:47,566
2 Iterations would be good! And let's see the number of Vertices that lowers to. That

89
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:51,566
lowers well inside our limit to 122.

90
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:55,566
And finally, I'm going to click Apply on this modifier,

91
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:59,566
so it changes our mesh and so this is now

92
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:03,566
the mesh we're working with. Excellent! So the next stage

93
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:07,566
is actually making this bottom flat. There's a couple of ways of

94
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:11,566
doing that, and I'm going to go in, I'm simply going to View it from the

95
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:15,566
Bottom. So View, Bottom, and I'm going to hop into

96
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:19,566
Edit Mode, so I can do some work. And let's zoom in! So we

97
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:23,566
have the bottom of our pin here, and it's really just this area here that

98
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:27,566
we need to be flat and we can double check that. So I'm going to go into

99
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:31,566
Edge Mode and select this edge loop inside

100
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:35,566
here. So remember, that's Alt and right-click to select

101
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:39,566
an edge loop. Then, I'm going to flip back over into Front

102
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,566
View and make sure that is the right edge to select.

103
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:47,566
Well let's go back into Front View and go down. So

104
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:51,566
here we have... Oh we can see there that it's certainly not flat, and I

105
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:55,566
think I can still do it? I deselected the edge loop there going around.

106
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:59,566
Excellent! So the final thing we can do there is,

107
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:03,566
if we open up our Properties Panel of the 3D Editor,

108
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:07,566
we can set the Z coordinates

109
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:11,566
to that entire edge loop to 0. So we're going to go in there,

110
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:15,566
making sure it's globally 0. And there we go,

111
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:19,566
that's totally flat. So that's going to make sure that's not going to rock or fall

112
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:23,566
over for Ben. So let's save this file now! I'm going to send it over

113
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:27,566
to Ben and make sure that it works as he expects it to.

114
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:32,266
Thank you, Mikey! So I've imported your much more compact mesh

115
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:36,266
here and added it to my pin. There you can see the

116
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:40,266
Convex lower poly mesh there, and I've given it a bouncy material.

117
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:44,266
Let's see what happens! Boing! Ha ha, much better!

118
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:48,266
Awesome! Now that's a game dev and an artist working well together! See you soon!
