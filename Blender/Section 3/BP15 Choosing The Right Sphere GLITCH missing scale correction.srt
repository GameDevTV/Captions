1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,766
So we've created our pin and

2
00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:05,766
we're moving on to the bowling ball! So welcome

3
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:08,433
to Choosing the Right Sphere!

4
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:12,400
So in this video we're going to learn that the

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
sphere is just the defining shape.Â The mesh topology

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,400
of that sphere can vary greatly,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
and, just for example here, we can have a UV sphere,

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
an ico sphere, and even a cube.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
And we'll be taking a brief look at the subdivision modifier.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,400
So let's hop over into Blender now and

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,466
experience some of these first hand.

12
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,800
OK, so welcome back into Blender!

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
I have loaded up a default file. If you've still got a previous project

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
open do remember to save it, before closing it and moving on to this.

15
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:52,233
Let's start, not with the cube, we'll go on to that in a

16
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:56,233
moment, and we will add a Mesh

17
00:00:56,233 --> 00:01:00,233
object in Object Mode, that is a UV Sphere. Let's

18
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:04,233
take a look at that! And before we do anything else, let's boil it

19
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:08,233
down to its fundamentals. How is it made up? So let's have a look over

20
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:12,233
here in the Operator Panel, so we can see

21
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:16,233
it has 32 segments. Let's play with that, let's move it up and down!

22
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:20,233
Excellent! So we can see that's changing the vertical ones, that's a bit like a

23
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:24,233
segment of an orange, so that's a good way of remembering that. And the rings...

24
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:28,233
Ah, there we go, the rings define how many are going around

25
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:32,233
the surface around here in a circle. So

26
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:36,233
we've got our rings there and our segments coming vertically, and the rings are horizontal lines

27
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:40,233
going around. Latitude and longitude I suppose, much like the

28
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:44,233
Earth. So if we boil this down to its very basics, so it can only have

29
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:48,233
a minimum of 3 segments and 3 rings, we can see

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,233
that's what it looks like at its simplest form,

31
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:56,233
so some sort of diamond or something along those lines.

32
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:00,233
And as we increase the segments, it can get very very

33
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:04,233
smooth and detailed, but you end up with

34
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:08,233
a stonking great bit of geometry there. That's

35
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:12,233
64 thousand faces, 130 thousand

36
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:16,233
triangles, so that's a pretty high def sphere. Usually you

37
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:20,233
would not be modeling anywhere near that, so we'll just set that

38
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:24,233
back to where it was before at 32 and 16, and we

39
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:28,233
can adjust the radius here to whatever size we want,

40
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:32,233
as always. I'm going to leave that at 1. So I'm going to leave that on

41
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:36,233
our view, I'm going to open up the Outliner here,

42
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:40,233
and I'm just going to hide that sphere from

43
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:44,233
view, so we can open it up again in a moment. So that's that object created!

44
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:48,233
Let's now play with another type of sphere,

45
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:52,233
an Ico Sphere. So an Ico Sphere, lets

46
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:56,233
go down to the basics. So we've got Subdivision here

47
00:02:56,233 --> 00:03:00,233
in the Operator Panel, let's turn that right down as low as it will go. OK, so

48
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:04,233
let's inspect it, let's move around, and we can see quite clearly

49
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:08,233
that this is a spherical like object

50
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:12,233
that is made up of triangles, and the more

51
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,233
triangles there are, the more detailed and more spherical

52
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:20,233
it becomes. But it's always triangles, so the entire surface

53
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,233
is completely even and divided with these triangles.

54
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:28,233
However, that can cause problems

55
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:32,233
with your geometry later on, because there's not defining edge

56
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:36,233
loops on that, whereas with the UV Sphere there is. So

57
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:40,233
let's close off Icosphere. So we've experienced those two. I'm

58
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:44,233
just going to up that back to about 3 or 4.

59
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:48,233
Yeah, that's quite high def there, we'll leave that there. So let's hide that one.

60
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:52,233
And then, I mentioned a Cube!

61
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:56,233
And most of you were probably thinking, what's this guy on? Is he off

62
00:03:56,233 --> 00:04:00,233
his rocker? That is not spherical! Not yet,

63
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:04,233
so much like an Ico Sphere is made

64
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:08,233
up of a series of triangles, if we

65
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:12,233
subdivide this cube, then

66
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:16,233
you actually end up with something that's rather spherical.

67
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:20,233
And this is a modifier that we'll use quite a bit, later on,

68
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:24,233
but I just want to hint on it now, because it's a very powerful modifier

69
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:28,233
that does come with some constraints. So if we hit the Modifier

70
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:32,233
tab up here, in the Properties

71
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:36,233
Pane, and Add a Modifier of type,

72
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:40,233
here we go, Subdivision

73
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,233
Surface. So it's in our... Oh, gone of there! ...in the Generate,

74
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:48,233
but if we scroll down,

75
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:52,233
you can already see with it set here in the, no

76
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:56,233
Operator Panel this time, over here in the Modifier Panel there

77
00:04:56,233 --> 00:05:00,233
is a number of Subdivisions, so 0 is no Subdivisions.

78
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,233
But if we Subdivide once, we get a kind of

79
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:08,233
spherical shape. If we bring up our Icosphere,

80
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:12,233
we can see it's still slightly bigger than what it was

81
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:16,233
before, but however, when you Subdivide a second time,

82
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:20,233
and we hide our Icosphere again, we can see it's gotten smaller. And

83
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:24,233
if we subdivide again, it gets closer and closer to a

84
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:28,233
sphere. Now, it's a little bit wonky still, but we're

85
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:32,233
almost there! And there is an operator called to sphere, I'm not going to show

86
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:36,233
you that, at the moment. I just want to show you that the cube can

87
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:40,000
actually be a sphere, using the Subdivions Surface,

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and I'll just cick Apply to apply the modifier

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,366
to our cube.

90
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:49,500
Now, there is one thing to take into account whenever

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
you subdivide an object like this, and if I hop into

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,500
the Wireframe mode, you'll see it really clearly. So we're in Wireframe

93
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
mode. If we enable another one of these

94
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,500
objects, you can see that those two pretty much line

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
up with one another, but this sphere in the middle is nowhere

96
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
near. In fact, I think it's about 16%

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
too small. So if we go into View and set it to

98
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Orthographic, so we can make a judgement on size a proper one, and then, just

99
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,500
move around it because it's a sphere, it doesn't actually matter which way you're viewing it from.

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
If we decide to scale our cube ironically, because it looks nothing

101
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,500
like that, we can see down in the lower-left the Scale

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
by which it needs to go up by is about 0.16 or

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,500
0.17, in order to match the same actual size

104
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
of the sphere we're working on. So there we go, there's three different

105
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
types of sphere to rack your brain around! Now one final thing

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500
on this cube, because I've just spotted it by

107
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
looking at this wireframe, actually. So let's hop back over into

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,233
Solid Mode and hop into Edit.

109
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,600
Now you see,

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,600
here in particular and in four places along

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
the top and bottom, are the remnants of it being a cube, so you

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,600
can never really get away from the fact that that was a cube. You can see it

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
straight away here that it in fact was a cube, because you've

114
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,600
got these points joining together, but it's still spherical in shape.

115
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Now, the great thing about doing this is, you end up with

116
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
a mesh topology that's all quads, rather than all

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,600
triangles, which has its benefits later on.

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,733
So I feel a challenge coming on!

119
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:39,133
I would like you to choose a sphere type

120
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:43,133
and make a ball! So choose your sphere type,

121
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:47,133
and the way that should be guiding you is, you should be

122
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,133
thinking about the placement of finger holes. Which one of those

123
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:55,133
three, that we've just been through, will enable us to equally space

124
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:59,133
finger holes, without causing us any problem?

125
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:03,133
So try out all three spheres, think about equal spacing for

126
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,166
our finger holes.

127
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,166
Now, according to Wikipedia, a bowling ball's

128
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,166
diameter is somewhere between 21.59 and

129
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:15,166
21.83 centimeters. Wonderful! So do

130
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:19,166
pick an appropriate scale to work in,

131
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,166
as we've done before with our pin. Finally, make

132
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:27,166
that sphere, and we'll cover the finger holes next. So don't worry about

133
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:31,166
making those, at the moment, we'll do that in the next lecture.

134
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,166
Pause the video now, and give that a go!

135
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:39,166
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop over into Blender!

136
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:44,266
So let's think carefully about our

137
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:48,266
sphere that we're working on. Well we want equal spacing.

138
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:52,266
Now, we can see by looking at this sphere, which is made from our

139
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:56,266
sub-divisioned cube, we can see that is not even.

140
00:08:56,266 --> 00:09:00,266
It does vary, our mesh topology varies, and it

141
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:04,266
gets closer and closer in funny shapes. It's not all complete squares,

142
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:08,266
as it goes around it can't possibly be that, and it ends up at funny

143
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:12,266
points here, so that would be no good for making our pin! So

144
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:16,266
I'm going to hide that, by clicking the eye over here. Oh,

145
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:20,266
I can't do that, because I'm not in Object Mode. So let's get rid of that! Let's have a look

146
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:24,266
at our UV Sphere! Now, this is great for globes

147
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:28,266
or perhaps an eye, by the looks of things, because things meet

148
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:32,266
at a pole at the top and bottom. However, again

149
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:36,266
this isn't evenly spaced! If we look at

150
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:40,266
some of the squares running around the middle they're squares, and as we come up to

151
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:44,266
the top, they're no longer there. So that would be a real

152
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:48,266
pain to work with, if we wanted evenly spaced stuff. So that leaves

153
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:52,266
our final one, which is the Icosphere! And looking at this,

154
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:56,266
anywhere we want we've got lovely segments,

155
00:09:56,266 --> 00:10:00,266
and it's even across its entire surface, so we will work with our

156
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,266
Icosphere! Now, I'm going to work to

157
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:08,266
2.6 Blender units, and that will actually align it to

158
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:12,266
the same scale that our bowling pins are at,

159
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:16,266
as well, so it's a 10 times scale. So let's do that now!

160
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:20,266
So I'm going to scale it up evenly on all axes.

161
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:24,266
Because it started at one, I can just do

162
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:28,266
2.6. That's right! And

163
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:32,266
there we go, we have our bowling pin at times

164
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:36,266
10 of real size, at 2.6, so again, it fits on our plain nice

165
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,333
