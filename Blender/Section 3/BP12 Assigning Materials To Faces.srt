00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome back, Ben with you again!

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,500
We're going to be talking about Assigning Materials to Faces! We want to put some stripes

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,500
around the neck of our pin. So in this video we will introduce the Material Properties

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Panel, tell you how to create and name materials.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,500
We'll be talking briefly about users of materials and how that impacts trying to delete

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,500
them, and we'll also, of course, show you how to assign a material to

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
the face. So the bit I want to bring your attention to is, on the

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
right-hand side of Blender over here in this panel

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
here. Now, what is the panel? It's called Properties! You can see from the icon. So in the Properties

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Panel, I want you to make it a little bit larger, and you can actually scroll

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
left and right. There's a lot of little controls in the Properties Panel, I'll show you. I can

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
either hold down the Middle Mouse Button or I could scroll up and down,

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
or for the sake of clarity, I'm just going to make the panel bigger for you guys. OK.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
So click on materials there! And what I want you to do, to start with, so that

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
this view looks like the slide is, I want you to go to where I'm hovering

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
at the top rightish where it says "Add a new material slot", because the materials

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
panel slot's very very sparse. There's no slots, there's nothing to be had. So you

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
click plus and now you're going to get a little bit more information,

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
and then, I want you to click New. So we've made a slot, it's just an empty

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
slot for a material on the pin. Now click New. And that's

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,500
now you're going to get to this view, which can look a little overwhelming, especially if you scroll down.

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,500
A lot of stuff there! I just want to focus above this line here, for now.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
So I've got a slide for you, which will help you to focus your eye in on what's going on

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
at the very top of this Materials Panel. So we've already done the thing at the top, which is we've

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
selected the Material Tab. The next thing you see is a bread crumb, it basically

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
tells you where we are. What are we dealing with? Are we looking at the scene? That's that

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
first little icon. Then, the cube is the object that we're dealing with, and then, we're

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,500
looking at the materials of the cube. So it just reminds you where you are and what you're working on.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
The next list is a list of applied materials, or it's

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
at least a list of material slots for this particular object,

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
so now the pin has one material slot. And we did that on the right-

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
hand side, with the Add, Remove, Copy/Paste buttons. And then, you've got another

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
little sliver along the bottom, which we're going to be using a lot, which is where you actually manage the material.

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
So let's dive back into Blender and take a look at how this works! So

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
here we made a Material slot, and you can make your Material slot panel

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
bigger if you like, by dragging like this. And we created a new one, and we called it

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Material. Well let's call it Pin. So click into here, where I'm highlighting, and type

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Pin and Return. And now, you'll see that we have a material

39
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
called Pin. OK, now there's another type of material we're going to

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
want on the pin, of course, which is going to be for the stripes around the neck. So let's

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
go ahead and make a second slot. Now,

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
you get a simplified interface. You need to make a second material.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,500
There it is, again it calls it Material, and we're going to call it Stripe.

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
So now we have two materials, Pin and Stripe. And if you click

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
here, to the left of the word Pin or Stripe, you'll see Browse Materials. You can also

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,500
see those two materials. This is like a library of materials that you could pick up, and you can

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
actually apply these to other objects in the scene, if you want later. There's some other more advanced

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
controls over here, we're not going to worry about for now. What we do need to do is give our stripe a

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
different color. So if you scroll down a little bit, you'll see under defuse, which is the

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
color that it scatters off in all directions, it's currently white. Let's make it whatever you like, let's say

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
red. OK, so we have two different materials, they're both

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
simple diffuse materials. You can see the preview here, one is just a kind of very

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
boring gray color and the other is a slightly more interesting red color.

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
OK fantastic! So what I want you to do

55
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
then is to go into Edit Mode, because now that we've setup

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
our materials for our pin we cannot apply them to individual faces, until

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
we are inside Edit Mode. So let's go into Edit Mode!

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Alright, and then, what I want you to do, once you're in Edit Mode, is I'm going to challenge you

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
to actually create the two stripes around the neck of the pin. I'm going to choose

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
a couple of face loops, this one here and maybe one a little bit

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
further up, but I'm going to leave it to you to actually do this for yourself.

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,933


63
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:07,933
I just want to bring your attention to one more thing, which is now that you've entered

64
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,933
Edit Mode, three new buttons have come up here in the

65
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:16,866
panel on the right-hand side, under the materials slots. You have Assign, Select, and Deselect 

66
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:19,932
The Select button selects all the faces that have the

67
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:23,933
material that you have selected in the list above on them on.

68
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:27,933
so have a go with that, and the Deselect button does the opposite - it

69
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:31,933
de-selects all the faces that have the material that you have selected above on

70
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,633
them, so can be pretty powerful.

71
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,666
So Assign assigns the currently selected

72
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,666
material, in the slots above, to the geometry that you have selected

73
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,666
in the Scene View. The Select button selects the entire thing,

74
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,666
so the pin, and Deselect would just deselect the entire object,

75
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:52,666
i.e. the pin. So if you wanted, for example, to apply the pin material to the whole

76
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,666
object, then you would click Select, which would select the whole pin, click on the word

77
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,666
Pin, and then click Assign. You'll actually find that's already happened, by default, when you create your

78
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,666
first material, it gets assigned to the entire object. So when you're going to make this stripe,

79
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:08,666
you're going to need to select the face loop geometry,

80
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:12,666
by doing that in the 3D View. Then, you're going to need

81
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,666
to select the strip and click the Assign button. So those three buttons only come up in Edit Mode.

82
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:16,899


83
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,833
So select a face loop for one stripe.

84
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,833
Hint, you can select a face loop by holding down the Alt key in Edit mode and

85
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,833
then using Face Select, so you've seen that in a previous video with

86
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,833
Mikey. Assign the Stripe material to that face loop, and then, repeat

87
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,833
again for another face loop to create the second stripe. So basically,

88
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,833
make two stripes on your pin. Go ahead, pause the video, and try that now!

89
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,833
Cool! Welcome back! So let's take a look!

90
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,833
A few things to check, before we go! Firstly, you do need to be in Edit Mode here, because we are dealing at a Face

91
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,833
Level, not just an object level. Second thing is, I want to make sure you are in Blender Render here,

92
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,833
you'll get some very different menus if you're not. OK fantastic! So we

93
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,833
need to select a face loop. So we go into Face Select Mode, down at the bottom of our screen,

94
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,833
and then, we hold down Alt and then

95
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,833
we click on one of the faces

96
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,833
and there you go, we get a face loop selected. Now, with the

97
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,833
correct material selected over here, you click Assign.

98
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,833
Boom, there we go! Now to do it for the other one, it's the same job! You hold down, you

99
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,833
right-click, face loop is selected, click Assign.

100
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,833
Perfect! Look at that, we have stripes on our pin! Now you can preview this in various ways, you can come

101
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,833
out into Object Mode, if you wish, and then, this is where you can use the various different

102
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,833
rendering modes for the Viewport. You could say Wireframe. Now in Wireframe, of course, you're not gonig to see

103
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,833
any of the materials, that's the whole point of Wireframe. You could go to solid

104
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,833
colored. Now this is just a very fast preview mode, for use inside the

105
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,833
Viewport here, for when you have complex models, and you do see your colors there, whcih is cool!

106
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,833
You could go to texture, which is similar, but it's actually using the scene lighting now. It's just

107
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,833
using this Lamp, which is why you only see it lit from one side. Or

108
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,833
you could go to Rendered. Let's just leave it with that, and that would show you what the final

109
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,833
Blender Render output may look like. But for now, we are just considering

110
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,833
solid, which we have been all along. We are staying with default lighting,

111
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,833
and we're just trying to get different faces, different colors. And we've done it, we've got a whole ring of faces

112
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,833
in red, which is pretty cool! So congratulations with

113
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,833
that! Do feel free to customize these things, if you want. You can always click back

114
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,833
onto the Pin. You can go back, say, into the Pin's material

115
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,833
and play with its Diffuse color here and have a vile different color for the

116
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,833
pin, if you wish. You can also do the same for the stripe, and if you want

117
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,833
to get a little bit more adventurous, we're going to explain all this later in the course. But if

118
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,833
you want to play with things like Specularity, and some of these other things, it's not going to do any harm

119
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,833
you're welcome to go and explore! But for now, the important thing is that you know how to put like a white

120
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,833
color or whatever color you like, on the back of the pin, and a different color on those

121
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,833
face loops around there. So well done,

122
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,833
you've got a colored pin! And we'll see you soon!
