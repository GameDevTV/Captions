00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Extruding to a Normal!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video we are basically going to change the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
axis for extrusion, for finer control.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So let's hop over into Blender and play with that now!

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,800
So the first thing that we can do here is, we can correct my

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,800
obviously deliberate mistake of this extrusion into

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,800
our model. Now fortunately, it looks like it

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
has gone down and through the center of our model.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,800
So how do we make sure that we can pull it back out

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,800
and line it up here? Well there are a couple of ways to that, but one of the easiest

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,800
ways is, once we have these

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,800
six faces selected, they combine all as

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,800
one to generate a normal, a common normal, which is

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,800
actually the same as the vertex normal in the middle here. It'll be pointing

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,800
upwards, so towards us. Now down

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,800
here with the 3D Manipulator Widget, that we've played with in the past,

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,800
you can change that from where it says Global

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,800
to a couple of other things, one of which is Normal.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Now, if we change that to Normal, and I'm

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,800
surprised we can't see the blue one anymore because it's pointing right at us.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,800
So the normal coming out of this vertex,

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
in the middle, is facing right towards us. So if we rotate around

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,800
we can see, there it is. And what we can do at this point is,

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,800
we can literally pull that back up and that will be perfectly

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,800
in line. So we can move it up or down, as much as

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
we want. Now, bowling balls have holes going inwards, so going out is no good,

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,800
but what we can do, [Laughs] at this point, is go ahead

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,800
and select the Snapping Tool, select

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
the... I don't really care which one we do it to, we can just

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,800
align it with a Face, and this time, when we move it backwards

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
and forwards, we can hover over a particular face we want to align it

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
with. And I don't think face is actually going to be the right one in this

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
case. I'm pretty sure that is now aligned, but I can't be 100%

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,800
sure, unless it's really to a

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Vertex. Let's do Vertex instead! So again, let's

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,800
move it up and down, and snapping, that is definitely

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,800
the right place now. Now because we've moved it all the way down and brought it back

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
again, that would have produced a series of doubles. So before we do

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,800
anything else, I'm going to now push it into our model

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,800
to a certain level

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,800
and that is 1 Blender unit.

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
So let's push that in now, by 1 Blender unit, so

43
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,800
that is -1 in the Z axis. And I'm going to turn Snapping

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,800
off. There we go! So if I type

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,800
-1, have I lost the opportunity to do that? Yes I have!

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,800
So let's grab that and move it in the Z axis.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,800
And remember, that will now be moving in the Z axis, that

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
is normal because that's what we've set.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
In fact, at this point, I'm just going to undo to here.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,800
So we're going to move that, not extrude in this case. The other

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
ones we will extrude, but this has already been extruded and it's just on top of one another

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,800
and in the Z axis by -1. And that should go inside

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
our model and it hasn't!

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,800
You see it's moved in the wrong Z axis. So along

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
here, have we got the orientation? So in the Operator Panel,

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
is Orientation that's currently set to Global. So

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
because we used to shortcut keys it's assumed something different

58
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,800
to what's down here. So if we change orientation back

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,800
to Normal it will go in and, in this case, exactly what

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,800
we want, in towards the center of our

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,800
sphere. OK, so there we go,

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,800
that's how you do that! Let's give you a challenge to do the other

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
two!

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,800
That

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,800
doesn't look quite the right depth, so I'm just going to

66
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,800
increase that a little to 1.5, and because I haven't gone

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
off of this yet, I can set that Z Constraint there to

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,800
-1.5. I think that will be better!

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,800
So let's go and do a challenge!

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,500
It's challenge time! I'd like you to create the remaining finger holes.

71
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,500
So use the circles that we have created,

72
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
extrude them along the Normal Z Axis,

73
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,500
and then, set them to a depth

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
of 1.5 Blender units. Pause the

75
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
video now and give that a go!

76
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop over into Blender

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,900
and complete our bowling ball!

78
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,900
OK, so we've successfully done that bowling

79
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,900
ball there. Let's go up to the top here, and

80
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,900
I can see straight away we've got one thing to do to our circles.

81
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,900
We need to inset them a little, before we actually

82
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,900
do anything else, so let's go ahead and do that

83
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,900
straight away. We can grab them both, so they're inset by

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,900
the same amount, and inset them, it doesn't have to be much.

85
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,900
And there we go! So now we're ready to do this! I know the extrusion

86
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,900
itself will not work, if we try and do them both at

87
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,900
once, because it will take a normal that's between these

88
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,900
two points, instead of the points themselves. So we're going to have to

89
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,900
select the faces themselves. It's

90
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,866
selected on Normal,

91
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,900
and I can just extrude, make

92
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,900
sure we are extruding and start to push it in. Now I can see that,

93
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,900
in the lower-left, it says it's

94
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,900
moving on the Normal. We can see that

95
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,900
straight away, it's done that by default which is great! And we can

96
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,900
set that, immediately, to -1.5.

97
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,900
And there we go, that's inside our pin!

98
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,900
So let's select these ones here, as well,

99
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,900
and it was set to Normal here, so if we press E this is also

100
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,900
going to extrude along a normal. This is brilliant! And let's set that to

101
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,900
-1.5. Now there is a chance that

102
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,900
these two will cross one another. So there we go! So a design

103
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,900
problem with our specs, straight away, is that the holes

104
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,900
themselves, these two, as they move in are going

105
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,900
to hit one another. But it doesn't look like the overlap is

106
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,900
that much, so, in this case, I'm going to simply

107
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,900
pull one of these back out, until they're not touching anymore.

108
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,900
So I'm going to grab that bottom, I'm going to move it in the Z axis,

109
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,900
but not the global Z axis, I don't want that.

110
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,900
I want to move it on this axis here, so I'm

111
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,900
just going to grab that instead and just pull it up ever so slightly. I can't see

112
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,833
what I'm doing.

113
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,700
We don't want geometry crossing, that's bad

114
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,700
bad bad. And there we go! So a

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,700
consideration there if someone gives you a spec that has a

116
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,700
fault in it. Do mention it to the person as quickly as

117
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,200
possible. I've already mentioned it to myself.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,600
Let's do the final thing now and hop into

119
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:45,733
Object Mode and look around our model, and that

120
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:49,733
looks absolutely fine! In fact, that doesn't look too far

121
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,333
apart now, that's looks absolutely fine!

122
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,600
Right, so the final thing that we will do on

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,600
this bowling ball is give it some color, it's looking a bit bland at the moment!

124
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,600
So let's go into our material properties

125
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,600
and add a new material slot, create a new material,

126
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,600
and I'm going to call it, very imaginatively, BowlingBall.

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Now, I'm going to scroll down here on Diffuse,

128
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm going to change that. What color should I have it? Why not

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,600
a yellow, a bright yellow color. Great! So there we go, we've got

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
our bowling ball all colored in. I'm going to make sure I remember to

131
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Save that as well, very important. And that's ready to

132
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,600
use wherever you want to use it! Now, some of you may be thinking, well

133
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I've seen bowling balls and they're sparkly or they've got textures on them or

134
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,600
words, etc. Don't worry about that, for the moment, in the next couple of sections,

135
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
we'll be going into much more detail with our models.

136
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
But do remember, the skills that you've learned so far, you can now go back

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,600
and practice, you know, color in the models that you've already made and saved in

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
your project folders. So that's great, and I will see you guys again

139
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,533
soon! Take care!
