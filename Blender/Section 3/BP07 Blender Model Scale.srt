00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Blender Model Scale! In

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
this video we're going to talk about from around 0.01

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Blender Units to 100 Blender Units,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Blender works really well; however outside of that, Blender

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
does not work well outside this range and that's very important

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
when you're working with your models. As a rule of thumb, the best

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
thing to do is use the grid floor, that we'll look at

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in a moment, as a stage for whatever model you're doing,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and if it looks right on there, then great model at that

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
size. And finally, pick an order of magnitude as to how

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
big this object is, different to how it is in real

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
life. It might be an order or magnitude of 1, it might just be the same,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
suitable for the level of detail for the model you're working on. So

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,466
let's quickly hop over into Blender!

15
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:59,466
When we open up our default cube, our default

16
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:03,466
scene in Blender, we have this cube here. Now this cube

17
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:07,466
has a radius of 1, i.e. it's 2 along every

18
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:11,466
edge, it's 2 Blender Units on every edge. And this

19
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:15,466
grid floor here, this is the stage that I'm talking about. So if we

20
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:19,466
imagine that that cube was sat on the stage, that's a descent size

21
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:23,466
for that particular cube. That's great! Now, if

22
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:27,466
we were to work with something much much smaller... So let's

23
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:31,466
delete our Cube there and create another Cube, and in the

24
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,466
Operator Panel, let's set its Radius to

25
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:39,466
0.001. So

26
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,466
that's quite small, that's an order of magnitude beneath what I've mentioned before,

27
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:47,466
and we can't even zoom in that far. It becomes a real

28
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:51,466
pain to see it. In fact, here I can see it. If I turn off the 3D Manipulator Widget

29
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:55,466
and move our 3D Cursor over there, we can just about see

30
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:59,466
our cube but we cannot zoom in any further. We'd have to start

31
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:03,466
playing with Blender in order to still see that, and we don't want to

32
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:07,466
do that, that makes our tool more difficult to work with. However,

33
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:11,466
if we change the Radius now and go to

34
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:15,466
0.01 our cube is

35
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:19,466
just on the edge of working. If we zoom in much more than that, it starts

36
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:23,466
the clipping thing again. As you can see that cube is not displaying properly,

37
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:27,466
and if we zoom in so far, well we start seeing through our model

38
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:31,466
in some weird manner. Now the same happens

39
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:35,466
if we increase this Radius now, to let's say 100.

40
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:39,466
Oh, it's a really really really really really big cube!

41
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:43,466
We can still work with that, that's absolutely fine! However, if we go

42
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:47,466
beyond that to about 300, I belive we'll start

43
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:51,466
getting some clipping. I can see it happening in the bottom

44
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:55,466
corners here. I can see that's clipping away, so that really is the absolute

45
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,466
maximume. If you go much higher than that, let's say to 500,

46
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:03,466
you can see straight away that Blender does not handle that very well,

47
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:07,466
and you're going to have to start, as I say, changing the settings

48
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,933
in Blender and that's no good! So as a rule of thumb, you really want to

49
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,666
work on a scale that fits this grid here. That's a

50
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,666
good rule of thumb. Not always, sometimes you may go beyond it if

51
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,666
you're making a large building or something like that, but as a general rule of thumb,

52
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,266
stick to that grid.

53
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,666
It's challenge time!

54
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,666
I'd like you to now think of the order of magnitude that you'll be

55
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,666
working with. So I've filled in part of this chart, so you can get

56
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:38,666
an idea of what we're working to. Our first column here, the

57
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:42,666
Object, is a real world object, and I've put its real

58
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:46,666
size in. Now, obviously you will find ants and grasshoppers that deviate

59
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:50,666
from these sizes. I'm 1.6 meters tall, so I've

60
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,666
based my human on that. Now that's actually quite short [Laughs] in

61
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:58,666
some cases. So you know these are just general, real,

62
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,666
sizes, not exact. And I've gone through the motions

63
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,666
of, which way am I scaling it? Am I scaling it up? Am I going to keep the

64
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,666
scale kind of the same, so 1 meter equals 1 Blender Unit,

65
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,733
or am I going to reduce the scale?

66
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,133
Pause the video now, go through

67
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:20,133
this list, give it some thought about how big you would make this Object,

68
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:24,133
on the left, in Blender.

69
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,766
OK welcome back! This is how I would do

70
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:32,766
the scaling myself. So let's start from the Car. The Car's

71
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:36,766
about 4 meters long in general, and I keep the scaling the

72
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:40,766
same in Blender. There's plenty of scope to do millimeter

73
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:44,766
level stuff, all the way up to the meter scale, so that's absolutely fine

74
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:48,766
we can keep that the same. And similarly with the House, you can keep that

75
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:52,766
the same as well, 10 Blender Units 10 Meters, absolutely fine.

76
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:56,766
Obviously some houses are smaller than that and some can be much bigger, that's

77
00:04:56,766 --> 00:05:00,766
absolutely fine. Next, is an Oil Tanker! Now, we're starting to get into

78
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:04,766
the realms of very large objects here. Now a real size

79
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:08,766
Oil Tanker could be in 400 meters or so, some are even

80
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,766
bigger I think, but you certainly scale that down, you would not work on a scale of

81
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:16,766
400 in Blender. As we've seen when you [Laughs]

82
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:20,766
approach 300, you start having problems anyway. So

83
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:24,766
I would scale that model down. Now, I would either scale it down by a factor of

84
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:28,766
10 or 100, and that depends on the level of detail that

85
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:32,766
I want. So in this case, I'll scale it down to 4

86
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,766
or maybe keep it up at 40, if I wanted that extra level of detail.

87
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:40,766
It depends on it's end application. Our Bridge,

88
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:44,766
right Golden Gate Bridge is nearly 3 Kilometers long, for instance

89
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:49,233
but you wouldn't want to make it 3 kilometers long in Blender.

90
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:53,233
3,000 Blender Units, that's going to be crazy, so you'd scale that down.

91
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:57,233
And again, depending on the level of detail you needed, you could make it

92
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:01,233
3 Blender Units if it was something you were viewing from a distance in a game or

93
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:05,233
just a low poly model of it I suppose. But if you wanted more

94
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:09,233
detail, you'd probably bump it up to 30 Blender Units. So

95
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:13,233
it would be slightly larger than our grid that we start

96
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:17,233
with but that's absolutely fine! Now, finally the Earth!

97
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:21,233
Now that's a big big object, 12,000 kilometers,

98
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,533
and obviously we're going to be scaling that down, but how far? Again it depends

99
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:31,533
on level of detail. I certainly won't go any larger than 120, and

100
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:35,533
I'd probably keep it around 12, unless I needed an excess

101
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:39,533
amount of detail. But once you start needing a lot more

102
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:43,533
detail, one of the things to remember is, you can always produce

103
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,533
another model. So for instance, let's take this Earth as a quick

104
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,100
discussion point.

105
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,133
So let's talk about scale, level of detail, and models!

106
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:56,133
So one model does not have to contain its all! Use

107
00:06:56,133 --> 00:07:00,133
multiple models when necessary. So imagine

108
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:04,133
you're zooming in from outer space, you're approaching the Earth. Well

109
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:08,133
when you far away, you can use quite a low poly

110
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:12,133
model of the Earth, it just needs to be a sphere, and then, we're zooming in,

111
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:16,133
so it's going to have to get more and more detailed at some point. But

112
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:20,133
we don't need to include all that detail on the one of the Earth

113
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:24,133
that is millions of miles away before we reach it, and

114
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:28,133
we certainly don't need to include all the of the detail on the Earth. By the time we're zooming

115
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:32,133
in to the level of let's say a city, and as we go more and more detail,

116
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:36,133
we can focus on the bits that we need. Now, you would have to make multiple

117
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:40,133
models for each level of detail but that's absolutely fine!

118
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,166
Think of the end in mind,

119
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,933
and you'd simply transition

120
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:48,933
between these low detailed models to higher detailed,

121
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,800
when you need to. Let's move

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,966
on to the next lecture!
