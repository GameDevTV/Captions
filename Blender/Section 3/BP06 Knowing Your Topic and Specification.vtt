00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome back! Knowing Your Topic and Specification!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So in this video we'll be understanding

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
your subject, planning your model, and knowing the

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
importance of research. So

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
challenge! Let's do some research!

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Pause the video now, go and search for bowling pictures,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
watch some videos, if necessary, and look up the specifications of

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the ball and pins.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
OK, welcome back! So how did you get on with that

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
challenge? Let's go off and do some research ourselves now,

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so you can see what I would be doing! OK, so I have

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Googled a picture of a bowling ball.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So we've got lots of pictures of bowling balls, now one of the things that's

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
incredibly important is I would have probably drawn a bowling ball like

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
this black one here. Now, as you can

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
see, a real bowling ball has two holes really close together, and a third one

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
for your thumb, much futher away. And I can always guarantee

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that if I had asked you to model a bowling ball, without

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
any reference material, you'd have probably put that third hole

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
for your thumb too close or the two finger holes

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
too far apart. Equally, when I was looking for a

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
bowling pin, you can see there are loads of different ones that you

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
could pick. And we'll be using one of these for our

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
reference material in a bit, so we can model a pin

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
accurately. And another thing I spotted, when going

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
down, was the actual configuration of the pins. So later on, when we come

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to laying out the pins themselves,

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we can see here we have an overview. They are 12 inches

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
apart from one another, in any direction, which is great! And this

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
line here, see that's 36, so it's an equilateral

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
triangle with 36, 36, and 36, and each one is

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
12 inches apart, which is great because that means

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we now know how to setup those pins in our scene, later on.

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
OK, so that's enough research for now! Let's crack

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.600
on and start doing some modeling!
