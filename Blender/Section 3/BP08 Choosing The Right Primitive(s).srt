00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Choosing the Right Primitives! So

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
why your choice matters, when you're picking a starting primitive.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, starting with a primitive the same symmetry and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
shape as your target model will save you time. So if you're

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
starting off making a book, perhaps you're doing a fairy

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
tale story book, then if you started off with a sphere

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it would take you a long time to get it down to a

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
book shape. And similarly, if you were making a ball,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you wouldn't necessarily start with a cube.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So it can be very hard to remove all traces

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
of that original shape. As I said, if you start with a

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
completely different shape, it's going to make your life difficult.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Fair enough if you want the challenge, but not a great idea!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So here's a challenge for you guys! Which primitive would you use?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So we've got some examples on the right-hand side, and

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
they're planes of symmetry. So if you were to cut through that object,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
it would look the same on either side.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Obviously these are basic examples of that. So pause the

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
video now, and fill out which primitive you think would

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
suite the examples on the right.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
OK welcome back! Here we go! So let's

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
explain these, as we go through! 
So a Cuboid has 3 planes of symmetry.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So imagine a book, smart phone, in general you could cut them through

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
3 ways. You could cut them through the middle, the top, or

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the front, and they would be the same, from a starting

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
point. Remember this is the starting point, not the end point. Obviously, after you've finished modeling

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
a car will have an actual top and bottom to it and start to lose

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
some symmetry. Now a Cone and a Cylinder.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well they're actually the same thing, a Cylinder is a special case

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of a Cone. So if you imagine a lamp shade, it's

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
kind of a cut off Cone, but if you widen that out it eventually

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
become a Cylinder and then it goes the other way again. So if you were modeling

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
any sort of bottles, a cup perhaps, the

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Christmas Tree type shape, you would start with a Cone or a series of Cones

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
in order to make that. Finally, we have a

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Sphere. So if you were making some fruit, like

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
an apple or a lemon or a rugby ball or anything spherical, it would

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
be an obvious place to start, by using a Sphere.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I hope you guys got on very well with that! Let's get on to the next

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,433
