00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Hey

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,300
welcome back! So we're going to talk about Exporting Models with Materials now!

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,300
We think we've nearly got our pin finished, and in this used case,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,300
it's going into a game engine. So let's carry on the process, let's get it finished!

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,300
Let's talk about how a .blend file may appear elsewhere, in this case,

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,300
in Unity, how to export as an .fbx file

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,300
with materials attached, why using a .blend file is

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,300
leaner if your target program will support it, briefly talk about smooth shading

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,300
and normals, you may have noticed that the pin is a little bit kind of blocky,

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,300
and then, I'll explain why we may want multiple levels of detail.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,300
So let's just have a look! What's this about work

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,300
flow and leanness? Well the leanest thing we can possibly hope

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,300
for is that our target package live reads .blend

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,300
files. So Unity, for example, if you put the .blend file in the Unity assets,

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,300
it will read it live, and you change the Blender file and it changes immediately in Unity.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,300
You may have a 3D printing software that does the same, you may have a different game engine,

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,300
whatever, so that's the ideal. The next best thing, if you can't do that,

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,300
is to save as a .blend file but just import into your target package.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,300
So at least you've only got one thing to do every time you make a change to your model,

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,300
and then, you go to your target package and you do another import. And the trickiest thing,

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,300
that you may need to do, is to export from Blender every time you make a change,

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,300
as a .fbx, .stl, or whatever and then, import into your program. So

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,300
you've got lean, medium, and hard, it's a bit like burgers. OK, so let's take

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,300
a look at all this in practice! Here's our nice stripey, pinie, thingy, widget!

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,300
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to crack open Unity for

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,300
you, which is a very popular game engine. Now it's free! If you want to go and download

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,300
it, from Unity's website, you're very welcome to, and you can

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,300
play with it. But this is a Blender course, so the purpose of me putting

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Unity up here is, I want to show you the livest

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,300
and leanest possible way of dealing with a .blend file in another program.

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,300
So if we don't export, rather, but save a copy

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,300
of the bowling pin, right into the

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Unity or your target program's appropriate

34
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,300
folder... Now, in the case of Unity, that is

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,300
the Assets folder. So I've put it in my target program's folder.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Now, Unity's very well behaved with this! What it does is, it notices something appeared

37
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,300
in this Asset folder, and I can just put it straight into Unity. Here it is,

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,300
there is your bowling pin in a game engine! Isn't that pretty cool! I'm going to move this

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,300
light out of the way, because it's very distracting. And there we go, congratulations we have

40
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,300
something in a different program! Now, the cool thing about working with a

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,300
program that works in my leanest paradigm, remember the top one here

42
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,300
the target package live reads the .blend file, is this. Look if I

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,300
go into Blender and I say go into Edit Mode and I go

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,300
grab maybe one of these faces and kind of yank it out like that, if I save

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,300
the .blend file, watch Unity! See it's immediately

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,300
changed in Unity! There it is, you see the pin has the thing in it, which I

47
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,300
think is very cool! Now I can undo that and resave, and Unity will

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,300
immediately noticed the difference. So that's the best possible workflow!

49
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,300
The next best workflow is that you need to kind of import into your target package but

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,300
it's still a .blend file. And the trickiest workflow is where you

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,300
need to go Export, as say an FBX.

52
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Let's try that from Blender, go ahead and try exporting your pin as a .fbx, by the way.

53
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,300
And you could, say, stick it in your Downloads and call it BowlingPin. You can leave all the

54
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,300
settings default and then you have a .fbx file. Then, you have to go

55
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,300
over to your target package and let's delete everything that's here,

56
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,300
for now, and then, you go in your target package and you Import a New

57
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,300
Asset and you go find it [Laughs] and then you Import it, and eventually,

58
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,300
you end up in a very similar place. Now notice, when you import a .fbx it also

59
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,300
has a Materials folder, the Pin and the Stripe are preserved, and if I open

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,300
up this thing, it has the Camera, the Lamp, the Pin, the Pin mesh,

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,300
etc. And I can still pop this pin in my scene and it still behaves!

62
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,300
So either way is good, but of course, now if I make a change in Blender... Ooh, I want that

63
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,300
pin to look more like this! Saving it's no good! I have to Export it

64
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,300
as a .fbx again and then reimport it. You see how much more of a hassle

65
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,300
that is, than just actually saving the .blend file? Yep, much

66
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,300
more of a hassle! So I am going to work with the .blend file, because

67
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,300
it's a lot easier for me, over here in Unity. So

68
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,300
I save my .blend file, look at Unity, and it updates immediately.

69
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,300
Lovely! OK fantastic! So let's go back to the slides and talk about the other things!

70
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,300
So you've seen how a .blend file may appear elsewhere, you've seen

71
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,300
how to export as a .fbx, with materials it all just kind of happens, and you've seen that

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,300
using a .blend file is a much leaner way of doing things. Now, I want to talk about

73
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,300
smoothing and normals and then multiple levels of detail.

74
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,300
So here is our bowling pin in Blender! And

75
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,300
if we're in Edit Mode, remember that you can go down here in the Properties

76
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Panel, and you can go somewhere and you can say, show me the normals. And

77
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,300
their Vertex Normals in Unity, so I'll show the Vertex Normals. There they are, they're little

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,300
hairs, and they are one per face. Another way to show it is sticking out

79
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,300
of the faces instead of the vertices, the same number of normals roughly.

80
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,300
So the problem with this pin is, both in Blender and over in Unity, it's

81
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,300
pretty rough, you see you can see every single cell. Now you may say, ooh I should turn the poly count

82
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,300
up, but hang on hold your horses, it's already got a lot of pollies. It's already got

83
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,300
what 1,680 triangles, which is plenty!

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,300
What we need is something called Smooth Shading, and back

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,300
in Object Mode, in Blender here,

86
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,300
you can go down under Tools and you can click on Shading, Smooth.

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Look at that! It's really looking pretty smooth now!

88
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,300
And if you do that and you re-save it, re-save

89
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,300
the BowlingPin, the great thing is that those extra normals, which you'll

90
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,300
learn later help determine how the thing draws, they come into Unity

91
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,300
as well. The same number of polygons! It's amazing! If you don't believe me,

92
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,300
then look here in Unity. It tells you 1,680, or

93
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,300
look back in Blender, 1,680. But it's a trick of lighting

94
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,300
that's making this look smooth. In fact, I would even go as far as to say that Unity

95
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,300
is doing a better job of shading that than Blender. Maybe when we go to

96
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,300
the Rendered Mode in Blender... There you go, Blender's doing a pretty good job in Rendered Mode.

97
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,300
But Blender's preview, it's solid preview, is not quite as

98
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,300
good as Unity's rendering. But anyway, there you go! So

99
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,300
we don't need to up the poly count crazily. What

100
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,300
a lower poly model like this will not do for us is hide the fact that the

101
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,300
edges are still a bit like Max Headroom. [Laughs] You can still see the geometry

102
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,300
on the edges there, and that, of course, is exactly the same

103
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,300
deal in Blender. It doesn't matter how much smoothing you put on, you're going to see the

104
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,300
geometry at the top of the pin,

105
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,300
whether it's Flat or Shaded. You see the edge, the outline, the

106
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,300
occlusion of the background is going to be the same, but going from Smooth to Flat

107
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,300
really makes a difference to the visual appearance, especially with a good shader like the one

108
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,300
here in Unity, or when you actually render later in Blender. Cool!

109
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,300
So the final thing I want to talk about now is, how about I'm

110
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,300
in a game engine, I may want this pin to do something, right? We presumably would have a bowling

111
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,300
pin, because we want to make maybe a bowling game and we want to do

112
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,300
something with it. So I'm just going to make a floor, really quickly here

113
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,733
and just put it below the pin.

114
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,566
So I'm just giving the pin some physics now,

115
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:34,566
and if we play the game, the pin falls straight through the floor. That's no good!

116
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:38,566
So what I want to do is add something called a collider! Now, the purpose of

117
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:42,566
this is that you, as a designer, are going to have to help with this, because watch what happens!

118
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:46,566
If I now try and add something called a Mesh Collider to this and I

119
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:50,566
say, well what's the mesh, and I go and say well it's the pin, look what happens in

120
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:54,566
Unity when I try and run this! It's going to complain!

121
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:58,566
None-convex mesh colliders are not allowed! Now Mikey's going to talk to you

122
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:02,566
about what a convex-mesh is, but it basically means that none of it sticks inwards. The neck

123
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,566
of this pin is concave, and this game engine will not allow

124
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:10,566
concave, so Mikey's going to be showing you how to make convex meshes. So say I

125
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:14,566
say to Unity, OK make it convex, it will go I can't, because it's got more than

126
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:18,566
256 vertices, my brain hurts! It's got far too many vertices!

127
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:22,566
Look in Blender, the vertices are 870! So it just doesn't

128
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:26,566
work, it can't work, I can't make this work, I cannot make my pin collide with the floor, and I'm

129
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:30,566
now an irritated game designer. So I'm going to go back to Mikey and say,

130
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:34,566
Mikey, I want a lower poly, a less than 255

131
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:38,566
vertex collider, and the end

132
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:42,566
effect of that is going to be something like this. He's going to provide me with a different mesh.

133
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:46,566
I'm then going to bring that mesh in here and it is going to be

134
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:50,566
a green outline like this and it'll be kind of something like

135
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:54,566
that but it'll be more pin shaped, and when we've finished, what'll happen

136
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:58,566
is my pin will actually, if it starts with some Rotation,

137
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:02,566
it will actually land

138
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:06,566
and fall over but properly. You see that's just dodgy,

139
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:10,566
because whatever I do with just a cylinder, i.e. this part of the pin here

140
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:14,566
hits the ground properly or the neck does but not both. You see if I thin it down, it'll

141
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:18,566
go through the floor, etc. So our mission now, with Mikey,

142
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:22,566
is to make a mesh that is 255 vertices or

143
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:26,566
less, representing the same shape and scale as the pin,

144
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,566
but is also convex. It must

145
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:34,566
be a convex mesh, so from this tip of the pin to here it's going to have to be a

146
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:38,566
straight line, nothing going in. So that's what comes next, and I hope that was helpful,

147
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:42,566
as you can see the fate of your models when they arrive in things like Unity!

148
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,866
See you soon!
