Welcome to Bridging Edge Loops!

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So in this video we're going to be learning the power of bridging edge loops,

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and then, oops, our pawn is lovely but has

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.133
too many polygons.

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.366
So just going back to our pawn

6
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:19.366
being lovely but has too many polygons, taking the lean principle I

7
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:23.366
pass my pawn straight on to Ben, so he can include it in a chess thing he's working

8
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:27.366
on. He's says oh, Mike, that's great, but I want it low

9
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:31.366
poly in style, not just in the polygon count itself.

10
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:35.366
So we're going to have to bring down our polygon count of our pawn, and a great

11
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:39.366
way of doing that is with bridging edge loops. So without further ado,

12
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.733
let's hop straight on over into Blender!

13
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:46.733
So the first thing I'm going to do here is just make our screen space a bit

14
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:50.733
bigger. I've noticed that, despite working with a tiny space, I'm making it even smaller

15
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.733
for myself. We don't need the timeline along the bottom, and I'm just going to drag that down

16
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.733
and out of the way. And I'm just going to get rid of the Tool Shelf and Properties Pane, so

17
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:02.733
we've got our pawn nice and big in the scene here,

18
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:06.733
on the screen. So this is a lovely pawn,

19
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.733
but Ben wants it lower poly. Now, I've already saved us the

20
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:14.733
pain of going through trying to decimate it, so we could use the Decimate

21
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.733
Modifier in here, and it doesn't matter which

22
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.733
one you do, eventually you get around and, I guess you want the Tool Shelf at this

23
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:26.733
point just to put flat shading on, so we can see what's happening to the

24
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:30.733
underlying geometry here. You can see quite

25
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:34.733
clearly that, either one of these you pick... I mean, Un-subdivide at least

26
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:38.733
tries to keep the over all thing. And yes, we do get kind of

27
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:42.733
low poly but the base starts becoming a bit weird and in

28
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:46.733
places, when we get down to a much lower level, and I

29
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:50.733
didn't like any of... That's kind of cool, I did kind of like that,

30
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:54.733
but at the same time, it's not going to be in keeping with any of the rest of

31
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:58.733
our pieces. So one of the best things we can do is bridging

32
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:02.733
edge loops. The first thing we need to do is hop on over into Edit Mode, so I'm just going to

33
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:06.733
undo that modifier I've got going there. So the way that this

34
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:10.733
works is, we can select each series of edge loops. So let's

35
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:14.733
do that now! I'm going to, basically, if we look at this one here we've got

36
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:18.733
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 edge loops, 7 in

37
00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:22.733
total, but we're going to leave the top and bottoms ones because we need them, and

38
00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:26.733
simply select those 5. So 1,

39
00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:30.733
2, 3, 4, 5, and that's using

40
00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:34.733
Alt and holding down Shift to add them. Alright,

41
00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:38.733
and we simply go X and delete all of the vertices associated with

42
00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:42.733
those edge loops, so it's nice and clean. Nothing at that top

43
00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:46.733
and nothing at the bottom, which is great! So

44
00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:50.733
now, we have a slight problem, it looks

45
00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:54.733
like I selected an additional edge loop. Oh, that one was

46
00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:58.733
already selected on our model! Be careful about that! So

47
00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:02.733
let's just go in and reselect those 5.

48
00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:06.733
So when I hopped into Edit Mode, that was actually the last edge that was there. So

49
00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:10.733
X to delete and Vertices. Brilliant! So we've got this

50
00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:14.733
great bit hole in our model. Now, I can't remember how many

51
00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:18.733
segments there were here, but I think it's about 32, but there will be 32

52
00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:22.733
vertices running around that circle and 32 running around this one. It

53
00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:26.733
simply means that we can hold down Alt and select that

54
00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:30.733
edge loop. Do the same with this top one, so holding down Shift

55
00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:34.733
at the same time, so we select them both. Then, under the

56
00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:38.733
Mesh menu, Edges and Bridge Edge

57
00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:42.733
Loops, it will do that for us. Now, the great

58
00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:46.733
thing about this, and this is really cool, so if we go down to this next section here

59
00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:50.733
and go, well I don't want those two there and

60
00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:54.733
just get rid of those. And this is going to leave some holes in our model but

61
00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:58.733
bear with me. I don't want that one, so I'm literally picking,

62
00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:02.733
kind of, control points, I suppose. I do want this edge here and I do want

63
00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:06.733
the one underneath it, so I'm just going to delete that one off. Now, let's move

64
00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:10.733
a bit further down on our model and zoom in. I want to keep that one

65
00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:14.733
but I don't want those, so I'll get rid of those

66
00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:18.733
to that point there, so I want to keep that. So I'll get rid of those,

67
00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:22.733
as well, and then finally, I won't go any

68
00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:26.733
further than that, I think you get the point here. Now, if I select the edge loops that are

69
00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:30.733
remaining, so those four there, and

70
00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:34.733
then, go Mesh, Edges, Bridge

71
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:38.733
Edge Loops, you'll see that it automatically bridges all of those loops,

72
00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:42.733
so I don't have to do them individually. Now, arguably, looking at that, I can

73
00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:46.733
almost get rid of that, but I think we need that to get the shape right.

74
00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:50.300
It's challenge time! OK, I'd like you to

75
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.300
lower the base polygon count! So open up the base .blend

76
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.300
file and save it as a new file, base Low Polygon,

77
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.300
baseLP, something along those lines. Make sure you are

78
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.300
working on the new .blend file, before you continue, and cut

79
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.300
down the amount of geometry, all the way down to around 100 triangles.

80
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.300
That should get you a descent low poly base. Now,

81
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.300
keeping the circular shape, I'd like you to make sure that the

82
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.300
circle, looking from the top, has 8 edges, so it's essentially an octagon

83
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.300
around its base. OK, pause the video now,

84
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.300
and go and give that a go! OK guys,

85
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.300
welcome back! Let's hop straight on over into Blender!

86
00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:38.533
OK, so we have our chess piece base open

87
00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:42.533
here! Now, the first thing I'm going to do is just clean up my interface a little

88
00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:46.533
around the edges here and just get rid of the Tool Shelf and properties,

89
00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:50.533
just so I can see my base a little better. OK, so we

90
00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:54.533
need to decide which set of edge loops we're

91
00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:58.533
removing. Well, first of all, I'm going to go into Top

92
00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:02.533
View. You don't have to go into Top View, it's just easier to

93
00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:06.533
work with. And I want 8 of these, and I do want them to line up with

94
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:10.533
the X, Z axis, otherwise it can be a wee bit confusing. So

95
00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:14.533
I want to keep that one, and 1, 2, 3, yeah!

96
00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:18.533
So I want to delete every third edge loop, so I'm going to go 1,

97
00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:22.533
hold down Shift and select those three, miss one and select another

98
00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:26.533
three, and I'm simply going to repeat that around our entire

99
00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:30.533
object. Now, this is a little tiresome, you may think, Oh, I could just go and

100
00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:34.533
recreate it, but depending on the size of the model that you're working

101
00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:38.533
with, that could also be a very gigantic task. At least,

102
00:06:38.533 --> 00:06:42.533
now we've got all the proportions right and everything else. So I'm going to

103
00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:46.533
press X now, and I'm going to delete Vertices. Now,

104
00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:50.533
at this point in time, we just need to recreate it now using those.

105
00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:54.533
I'm going to select everything, pressing the A Key,

106
00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:58.533
and then, finally go to Mesh, Edges,

107
00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:02.533
and Bridge Edge Loops. There's another really quick

108
00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:06.533
way of doing this, we've covered it before. And since we're going to be doing Bridge

109
00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:10.533
Edge Loops several times in a row, when we press space

110
00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:14.533
if you start searching for Bridge Edge Loops, there we go,

111
00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:18.533
I can just press Enter, at that point, and we can see that it leaves a gap.

112
00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:22.533
So I'm just going to select that final edge loop there and this one here...

113
00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:26.533
Whoah, then select the right one, that one there and that one there.

114
00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:30.533
Brilliant! And this time, I can just hit Space again to bring up this search

115
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:34.533
and press Enter, straight away. Really powerful, being able to

116
00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:38.533
do that, especially if you're doing a lot of repetitive tasks. OK, so

117
00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:42.533
the final set of edge loops, that is 8 yeah, the final set of

118
00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:46.533
edge loops is just to make sure this isn't quite so curvy. And usually,

119
00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:50.533
the best way of doing that is, if we look at the profile running down

120
00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:54.533
here, is to remove the ones in between the points of

121
00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:58.533
inflection. So that would be this edge loop around the

122
00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:02.533
top, not the very top one but that one there. Then, it's got a point here, then

123
00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:06.533
these two can go, leaving that one. These two can go

124
00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:10.533
here, leaving that one. Oh, I'm not holding down Shift,

125
00:08:10.533 --> 00:08:14.533
for anybody watching! That was a bit silly of me! There we go, those are selected.

126
00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:18.533
I want to keep that one, and these can go! Now, it's a

127
00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:22.533
bit... I don't know which one of these to keep, I'm going to keep this very bottom

128
00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:26.533
one, I think, and then, this and I'm going to keep

129
00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:30.533
that coming out, so we've got it defined, coming back out

130
00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:34.533
here. Then, get rid of these three but keeping an edge along

131
00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:38.533
the bottom. OK, I think I'm happy with that! I'm going to press the

132
00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:42.533
X Key and delete the Vertices. OK,

133
00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:46.533
and the final thing to do is, I'm going to select everything and go

134
00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:50.533
Mesh, Edges, and

135
00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:54.533
Bridge Edge Loops. Of course, you could just use the Spacebar again and press Enter.

136
00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:58.533
And that's looking pretty good, but I am actually going to just make

137
00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:02.533
sure a couple of things are working. I'm going to fill in this top, using

138
00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:06.533
the edge loop around the top and pressing F. I'm going to

139
00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:10.533
rotate around to the bottom and select this

140
00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:14.533
bottom one and do exactly the same there, fill in that face.

141
00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:18.533
Now, the final thing I do want to do, because we've been playing about with the geometry here,

142
00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:22.533
is just make sure there are no doubles. So I'm going to open up the Tool Shelf,

143
00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:26.533
select everything, make sure I'm still in Edit Mode, scrolling down

144
00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:30.533
and Remove Doubles. Ah, there's nothing there. And I'm also just going to

145
00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:34.533
make sure the normals are correct. In that case, I'm going to use

146
00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:38.533
Control and N, if you remember from earlier, and just make sure they're

147
00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:42.533
outward facing for us. That's brilliant! The

148
00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:46.533
final thing, that I could have done to begin with is but I decided to do at the end,

149
00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:50.533
was go to File and Save

150
00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:54.533
As, and I'm going to call mine LP Chess Piece Base.

151
00:09:54.533 --> 00:09:58.533
Save As A Blender File. That's great! Let's just have a look at

152
00:09:58.533 --> 00:10:02.533
our details we have here. So vertices, we've got

153
00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:06.533
56 Edges. Faces there and Triangles, those are our

154
00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:10.533
polygon counts; often, a lot of these just get divided up into

155
00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:14.533
triangles anyway, is 108. So that's perfect,

156
00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:18.533
that's met our specification. How did you guys get on?

157
00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:22.533
Share in the discussions, and I will see you in the next lecture!
