00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Re-centering Your Objects!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video we'll show you how to center your model in the view

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and learn how to control an object's origin.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,133
Let's hop straight on over into Blender!

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:17,466
So here we are in Blender, and we're going to

6
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:21,466
deal with two things. Now, first of all, I'll show you the origin, that

7
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:25,466
origin is the orange circle right in the middle here

8
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:29,466
and we can move that about to our hearts' content. It's also acts

9
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:33,466
on several things, later on, in Blender, so it's important to understand

10
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,466
its placement is critical when doing certain things.

11
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:41,466
So first of all, let's zoom back out and look at our chess board, and

12
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:45,466
a very good way of doing this is to simply press

13
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:49,466
Shift and the letter C; that will

14
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,466
center our view around the model that we have selected. So there we

15
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:57,466
go! Brilliant! Now, let's go about exploring this

16
00:00:57,466 --> 00:01:01,466
origin! Now, on the Tool Shelf, you may have already spotted

17
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:05,466
Set Origin, if we click on that it gives us a couple of options.

18
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:09,466
So one is to move the Geometry to that Origin, so

19
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:13,466
center the geometry, that is our chess board that's square in front of us

20
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:17,466
or checker board in front of us. It'll move the geometry all the way across and

21
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:21,466
center the geometry around the origin. The other, the next

22
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:25,466
one down, is exactly the opposite, so the selection will stay

23
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:29,466
absolutely fine, the geometry there, and it will move the origin

24
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:33,466
to the center of our chess board.

25
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:37,466
Now, Origin to 3D Cursor, we can move the 3D Cursor

26
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:41,466
around. You've seen that before! And if we move the Origin to

27
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:45,466
3D Cursor, you can see that the orange blob has moved to the 3D Cursor.

28
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:49,466
Finally, Origin to Center of Mass!

29
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:53,466
Now, because this board is equal

30
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:57,466
all the way around, then Origin to Center of Mass does exactly the

31
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:01,466
same, in this case, as Origin to Geometry, but for instance, in our

32
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:05,466
pin in the last exercise, because it was larger on the bottom

33
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:09,466
that it was on the top it does a calculation. You'll find the the origin will be

34
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:13,466
slightly lower because it's got more volume, down at the bottom of that

35
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,466
pin than it has bang in the middle. The Origin to Geometry would have put

36
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:21,466
that smack bang in the middle of the pin, vertically

37
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,933
and horizontally.

38
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,300
So I've got a challenge for you now!

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,733
I would like you to move the board's origin

40
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:31,733
and its placement. So set the board's origin to the center

41
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:35,733
of the board, and make sure the board is centered in our

42
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:39,733
scene. Pause the video now and go and give that a

43
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,733
go! OK guys, welcome back!

44
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's give that a go!

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,733
Alright, so here we are in Blender, and

46
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:52,733
I've moved the origin or the origin happened to have moved all the way over here,

47
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:56,733
far from any logical place. So I need to do a couple of

48
00:02:56,733 --> 00:03:00,733
things here! First of all, we can Set our Origin

49
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:04,733
to the Geometry. So Geometry to Origin, or origin

50
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:08,733
to geometry. Since that's already flattened on the X, Y plane, we will do that!

51
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:12,733
So Origin to Geometry, and that's placed it smack bang

52
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,733
in the middle of our board! Secondly, we want this whole board

53
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:20,733
centered around the worlds where X, Y, and Z equal 0,

54
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,733
so those two are there. So a couple of ways of doing that. Since we can move the

55
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:28,733
origin to this 3D Cursor, we can also move the

56
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:32,733
object of the 3D Cursor, but first of all, we need this 3D Cursor

57
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:36,733
smack bang in the middle. There are a couple of ways of doing that but a very quick one

58
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,733
is the Shift and S, and we can see there's a

59
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:44,733
Snap. So we can Snap the Selection, that's currently the selected object, Chess Board,

60
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:48,733
to our grid. We don't want to do that, so Selection to Cursor. That would move

61
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:52,733
the whole Selection to the Cursor, as it is, so we'll need to do that in a moment but not

62
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,733
now, because the cursor is in the wrong place and that's an

63
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:00,733
offset to the one above. So finally, Cursor to Selected,

64
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,733
that would move the cursor to the center of the geometry here. Let's bring back

65
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:08,733
up the menu. Cursor to Center, now that's the one that we want,

66
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:12,733
that'll snap the cursor right to the center of our world!

67
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:16,733
So if we click on that, we can see the cursor's moved all the way over there.

68
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,566
So now that we have the 3D Cursor in the right position, the next

69
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:25,566
thing to do is move this board to there,

70
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:29,566
as well. So after we've moved the 3D Cursor there, we can simply

71
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:33,566
go Shift and S again, and we can move this

72
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:37,533
Selection to the Cursor. So what we have selected is currently the board.

73
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:41,866
and If we go Selection to Cursor, we'll find the board will

74
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:45,866
snap across. Brilliant! A couple of other places you can

75
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:48,300
find that option is

76
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,100
under the Object Menu, under

77
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Snap we've got all of those options there for you.

78
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:58,266
OK Brilliant! I'm going to center around our model again,

79
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,666
and there we go!

80
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,233
Let's move on to the next lecture!
