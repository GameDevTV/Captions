00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.400
Welcome to Diffuse and Specular Materials! So in

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.400
this video, well we need to understand these for getting

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.400
rendering just right. We'll be looking at the two in isolation and seeing what they

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.400
do and combining them to see the overall effect. And just

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.966
a reminder that we are still using Blender Render! so

6
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.633
Diffuse vs. Specular

7
00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:26.633
reflections! Well both are types of reflection, and

8
00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:30.633
Diffuse is essentially when light scatters, as it hits a surface,

9
00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:34.633
and Specular is a direct reflection of the light

10
00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.633
onto the viewer. Materials, in the real world, are often

11
00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:42.533
a mix of the two. So a bit of physics for you all,

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the Law of Reflection! So we've got the blue arrow on

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the left, and that's the light coming in the angle of incidence of

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of that light beam coming in. This is just a tiny photon hitting

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
this surface, equals the angle of reflection, that's the

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
light coming out of it. So that's the basic Law of

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Reflection, and let's look at that in a bit more detail. So

18
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:11.766
Specular Reflection looks kind of like this! So a highly Specular

19
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:15.766
surface, almost 100% in this case, if I've got my angles and

20
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:19.766
everything right, the light beam comes in and comes out in exactly the same way

21
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:23.766
it came in, and that would produce what you would see

22
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:27.766
like on a mirror or on a lake, a still lake

23
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:31.766
reflecting mountains in the background. How picturesque! So that

24
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:35.766
would be almost 100% specular reflection, where you

25
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:39.533
get a direct reflection of whatever is coming in.

26
00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.033
Diffuse Reflection, however, is slightly different, because

27
00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:48.033
the real world is not all lovely, flat, and smooth,

28
00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:52.033
we end up with a lot of Diffuse Reflection. As you can see here, the light's

29
00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:56.033
coming in and going out is all over the place, so you

30
00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.300
don't get

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.566
direct reflection. Just like when you look at your wall,

32
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:04.566
right now, it's probably painted in a matte or a satin

33
00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:08.566
paint, rather than a highly glossy paint, which is more Specular,

34
00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.300
and then, of course, you may have mirrored walls.

35
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.100
So let's hop over into

36
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.100
Blender and see how these act, when using Blender Render.

37
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:22.666
Alright, so I've opened up a new Blender file!

38
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:26.666
I suggest you save the work that you're working on. Now, the reason why I've opened up a new one is because

39
00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:30.666
we're going to be playing about and experimenting, and we don't want to

40
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:34.666
do that in the chess scene that we're working with, at the moment. So the first

41
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:38.666
thing that I'm going to do is get rid of our cube that's here, because it's

42
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:42.666
not going to show off the Diffuse vs. Specular very

43
00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:46.000
well, so I'm just going to Delete that from our scene.

44
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.266
I'm then going to Add, into our scene, the

45
00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:53.266
Monkey, a bit more exciting a mesh! And

46
00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.266
since the light is above the monkey, just behind it, as

47
00:02:57.266 --> 00:03:01.266
we can see here, that little orange blob now, well

48
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:05.266
we will want to orientate our monkey so at least it's

49
00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:09.266
facing that way. So I'm going to rotate it around the X axis.

50
00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:13.266
Whoah, there we go! And that

51
00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:17.266
will probably be enough, but I'm just going to rotate it around the Z, as

52
00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:21.266
well, so the face is facing the light!

53
00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:25.266
I'm going to quickly hop over into Rendered Mode, on the Viewport shading,

54
00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:29.266
just to make sure that the face is getting the right amount of light,

55
00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:33.266
and it seems it is! Now, a couple of things I want to do, that's a bit too

56
00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:37.266
low poly for me; I do want to up it, so I can really show off

57
00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:41.266
what the Specular and Diffuse shading can do. So I'm going to

58
00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:45.266
turn on Smooth Shading, initially, and see what happens, and it's still a bit jagged around

59
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:49.266
the edge. So, as we've done in the past, I'm going to add a

60
00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:53.266
Modifier, a Sub-Surface Division Modifier, just to smooth

61
00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:57.266
this mesh out. So under the wrench, under Add Modifier.

62
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.433
So we're going to Add the Modifier here,

63
00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:02.466
Subdivision Surface Modifier, under the Generate,

64
00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:05.500
second column, third one up from the bottom.

65
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.500
And oops, that's done enough smoothing, I'm happy with that! I think if

66
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.500
it gets any smoother, we probably won't notice if we up it even one more.

67
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.500
Ah, there isn't a small difference there, but again, you get into

68
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.500
diminishing returns quite quickly, so I'll probably leave that at 2, for the

69
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.500
moment. So there we have our monkey! I think she's

70
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.500
called Suzanne? Yes she is! Excellent! So we need to

71
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.500
apply the material to that monkey there.

72
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.500
So now, create a new material and just call it Test.

73
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.500
So there we go! And this material, let's scroll down a little and

74
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500
have a look at the options. So we have Diffuse and Specular. We're going to be

75
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.500
focusing on these two here, it's Shading, Transparency,

76
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.500
Mirror, Subsurface Scattering, Strand, Options, etc. etc.

77
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.500
We can go into those at a later time but not now, we really want to

78
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.500
focus on just these two here, because they're going to make up most of what you're going

79
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
to be doing, so I'm just going to hide all of that lot there. OK, so the

80
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.500
intensity on both of these simply turns up their values. So if

81
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.500
they're both down at 0, you probably guessed it that the

82
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.233
image is completely dark and

83
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.400
is not reflecting any light at all. In this case, it's absorbing

84
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.400
all the possible light. The Diffuse, when we turn that up, well

85
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.400
if it's all at 1 we end up with a very matte finish, so there's

86
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.366
lots of diffuse reflection coming from here. So

87
00:05:31.366 --> 00:05:35.300
we have that scattering effect that we looked at earlier, so this would be

88
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.300
very similar to a terra cotta pot. So if we change this

89
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.300
to maybe that sort of color. There you go, ooh that's

90
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.300
a bit too pink now! Very close, I was the second click.

91
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.300
I'm not going to play about with this! So there we go, a sort of

92
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.300
terra cotta pot! But if you were to gloss that pot, you would

93
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.300
add some Specular to it, so that will give it some highlights. So we'll

94
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.300
bring the specular up and see how it looks. And in this case, this is looking rather plasticky

95
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.300
still, and we may need to actually change the hardness.

96
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.300
So if we lower that down, you'll find that the

97
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.300
highlights get more and more spread out, and if we make it really really really

98
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.300
hard, it goes up to 511, we end up with these

99
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.000
very fine wispy like highlights.

100
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.866
So that changes the apparent hardness or

101
00:06:26.866 --> 00:06:30.866
sharpness of those reflections, and you can play about with those to your heart's content.

102
00:06:30.866 --> 00:06:34.866
Ramp, well that changes the way that the color

103
00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:38.866
is brought into the scene, and this, we can see here, enables a

104
00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:42.866
lot more options. And we're not going to go into those, at the moment either, we just need to know

105
00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:46.866
about these two items here. Now these two here, the

106
00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:50.400
Lambert and CookTorr, they're the shader types.

107
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.266
So you've got five options of

108
00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:57.266
Diffuse Shader and five options of

109
00:06:57.266 --> 00:07:01.266
Specular Shader. Now, these change how the

110
00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:05.266
Diffuse and Specular Shading is worked out, and

111
00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:09.266
it does vary quite dramatically between all of these.

112
00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:13.266
Fresnel, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, as you can see here has

113
00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:17.266
changed it very very dramatically, and these are quite sensitive.

114
00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:21.266
Let's turn it up, maybe, to 1.2 and maybe that down to 2.

115
00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:25.266
So you get a very sort of chrome like effect going

116
00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:29.266
on with the Fresnal shader, going on there. The CookTorr

117
00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:33.266
on here, well if we change it we see we get much sharper.

118
00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:37.266
I'm just going to change these, now you get a completely different feel and look

119
00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:41.266
to your model, depending on which shader option you go for. Some of them will

120
00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:45.266
be very very similar. I quite like this one, the

121
00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:49.266
Warsido, or Wardiso.

122
00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:53.266
I can't [Laughs]... Ah, here we go, it's "use a Ward

123
00:07:53.266 --> 00:07:57.266
anisotropic shader". So there's lots of options

124
00:07:57.266 --> 00:08:01.266
there, and you can change these about to your hearts' content and get the

125
00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:05.266
actual end result that you want. That's gotten incredibly plastic

126
00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:07.400
here, at this point, but there we go!

127
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.600
We can see that the Oren-Nayer

128
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.600
gives this new option down here, Roughness, so that

129
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.600
will increse I presume the aparrent roughness of a material,

130
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.600
making it slightly dark, by the looks of things. Now, this is quite a smooth

131
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600
material, so I don't know whether we'd get a decent result,

132
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.300
playing about with it anymore.

133
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.066
Now, if we look behind the area

134
00:08:31.433 --> 00:08:35.433
where we don't get any light, at the moment. Now, this is

135
00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:39.433
again one of the things to remember with Blender Render,

136
00:08:39.433 --> 00:08:43.433
you won't get any bounce off of other objects, but you can

137
00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:47.433
fake some of that. I know we said we're not going to dip into

138
00:08:47.433 --> 00:08:51.433
the Shading or anything lower, but one of the things you can do is

139
00:08:51.433 --> 00:08:55.433
just make the material itself slightly emissive, as if it's giving off

140
00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:59.433
light. And of course, it would give off light if there was something hitting the back.

141
00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:03.433
So if you turn up the Emit value, ever so slightly, all of a

142
00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:07.433
sudden, the back is not completely dark. One or two is absolutely

143
00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:11.433
fine, and that just gives it a bit more detail in the background.

144
00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:15.433
There are other options down here, feel free to play with them. One of my favorites

145
00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:19.433
is Mirror and turning the reflectivity all the way up. Of course,

146
00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:23.433
that's reflecting, what's it reflecting? Absolutely nothing! It's reflecting

147
00:09:23.433 --> 00:09:27.433
the environment around it, but obviously, you can play with that to your hearts'

148
00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:31.133
content, perhaps pop something in an environment and turn the reflectivity up.

149
00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:35.133
OK, so to just finalize here, I've done the monkey

150
00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:39.133
Suzanne, using all five different

151
00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:43.133
Diffuse Shaders. So over here in the Outliner, I'm just going to turn them on

152
00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:47.133
one at a time. So this is, as I've said before, it's Fresnel.

153
00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:51.133
No it's not, the s is actually silent, so I presume it's frenel.

154
00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:52.366
This is what it would

155
00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:54.966
look like. If we turn Lambert on

156
00:09:54.966 --> 00:09:58.966
we can see that that is ever so slightly different, as well.

157
00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:02.966
The mini art is down here,

158
00:10:02.966 --> 00:10:06.966
let's turn on the orin, and that's up

159
00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:10.966
there, and then, finally the tune shader, and we'll just

160
00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:14.966
let that render out. And you can see that each one is drastically

161
00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:18.966
different from the last one there, completely different in their

162
00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:21.233
appearance. So it's worthwhile

163
00:10:21.233 --> 00:10:24.866
trying out the various ones to get the style that you

164
00:10:24.866 --> 00:10:26.400
want.

165
00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:30.566
Alright, a quick challenge for you guys now, a reflection challenge!

166
00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:34.566
So assuming the same lighting conditions,

167
00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:38.566
grab a pen and paper and name yourself a material that is almost 100%

168
00:10:38.566 --> 00:10:42.566
specular. Then, think about

169
00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:46.566
which materials you think have almost no specularity, that don't have

170
00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:47.900
reflections on them.

171
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.033
Now, look at items around you and you will suddenly start

172
00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:55.033
noticing this detail in objects themselves.

173
00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:59.033
So pause the video now and give that a go!

174
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:03.033
OK guys, welcome back! Well looking around what

175
00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:07.033
I had, I have my tea pot here, lovely

176
00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:11.033
reflection in there and my little Bluetooth headset,

177
00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:15.033
and they were very glossy and highly specular and

178
00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:19.033
we can clearly see reflections of the windows, amongst other

179
00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:23.033
things in those objects. So going on to a medium

180
00:11:23.033 --> 00:11:27.033
specular, well my micphone stand is sort of a satin

181
00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:31.033
finish to it and has quite clearly

182
00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:35.033
defined specularity on it, but it's not

183
00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:39.033
super reflective. The same with the toy train that I have on my

184
00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:43.033
desk, for some bizarre reason, and I notice,

185
00:11:43.033 --> 00:11:47.033
of course, there is a bit of high specularity in the wheel hubs and the

186
00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:51.033
magnet there on the front but that's fine, the rest is sort of a medium.

187
00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:55.033
Then finally, low specular, I've got an old Nexus phone, and the

188
00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:59.033
back of it is very rubberized, so it doesn't really

189
00:11:59.733 --> 00:12:03.233
reflect anything at all. In fact, in this case,

190
00:12:03.233 --> 00:12:07.233
that leading edge there is really exaggerated, because it's a light quite

191
00:12:07.233 --> 00:12:11.233
close to it. How did you guys get on?

192
00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:12.433
I hope you now get

193
00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:16.133
what Diffuse and Specular are, and I will see you

194
00:12:16.133 --> 00:12:18.866
in the next lecture!
