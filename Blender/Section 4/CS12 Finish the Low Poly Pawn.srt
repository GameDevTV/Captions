00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi guys, we're going to finish off our geometry for our pawn,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
so I'd like you to create the low poly pawn! So open up

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the new low poly base piece, that we've just made.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Make sure you save that as low poly pawn, for instance,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then, make sure you're working on that new .blend file,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
before you start altering any geometry. Finally, be

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
mindful, when you've done this, to keep the top sphere to 8 segments,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and then,, it will match up easily with the rest of our model.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Pause the video now, and give that a go!

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop straight on over into Blender!

11
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:45,566
So back in Blender we've got our base here! The first thing I'm going to do

12
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:49,566
is File, Save As, and call

13
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:53,566
this LP Pawn, I think.

14
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:57,566
I'm happy with that name! So we

15
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:01,566
can start working to it straight away. So let's nip on the Properties

16
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:05,566
Panel, make sure that the Background Image is turned on.

17
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,566
We can see that there, brilliant! So we just need to move around into the

18
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:13,566
Front View. We should still be able to see our

19
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:17,566
image. We can't see our image! Why not?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So it's

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
not hidden here, the axis is all views, we've got the

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
picture there. The Opacity is turned all the way down! So there we go!

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Easy to forget that you've turned the Opacity down, certainly easy

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
for me to forget anyway. So let's grab this

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
top face here, whilst we're in Edit mode, which we are,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and we can extrude that up. So I'm going to hop straight back around to the

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Front View, and let's move this

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
up to the right level. I'm giong to pop one line there

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and then one line at the top there. Brilliant! So we've got

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that bit sorted. We just need to grab this edge loop

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
around here and scale it outward. Oops, not inwards

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
but outwards. Grabbing this edge loop

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
underneath it, I'm going to scale that one in.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So that's roughly right! And then finally,

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
this top edge loop, as well, will be scaled in as well.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So that's fine there, and as we did before,

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
we need to pick a certain segment size for our sphere. So I'm going

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to hop out into Object Mode, so I can create our

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
sphere as a separate mesh object.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to go for a UV Sphere. I'm happy with a UV Sphere! I'm going to drag it up.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We can see, straight away, that's too many sections!

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If anything, it'd be really nice if it could line up roughly with our

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
8 here. So let's recreate

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
a UV Sphere!

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So Mesh, UV Sphere. So Segments, well we only want

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
8, but 8 by 16 is going to look a little silly as we can

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
see there. Let's just try 8 by 8 and see how that looks!

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That looks OK, actually! Can we go any lower with the rings? We don't

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
need them higher, perhaps 8 and 4. I think we can

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
get away with that! That's quite a nice low poly scale there, we'll

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
deal with the size in a moment. So now, we've got the right size here, we can just

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
pull it up so it's roughly in the middle, not the right size definitely, and then, pull

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
it in a little, as well. And the geometry itself

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
should match up relatively well, often quite a good job there of bringing it

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
together, actually. That was a complete accident, that was not deliberate at all!

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But that's close enough! 

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well there we go, that's brilliant! I'm really

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
happy with that, actually! So the final thing, of course, is to merge these into one mesh

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
object, and we can use Control and J for doing

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that, to join those two together, and there we go!

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So let's have a quick look around our piece, and let's flip

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it around to the Front View, to just see how it appears against that. Well

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
yes, actually, I agree with the fact that that sphere is probably still

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
a little big! So I was kind of lucky and kind of not, at the same time.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I'm going to, fortunately I've got enough undos, we haven't done

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
much since then, so the two are separate. I'm just going to zoom in, so I'm

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
on the right... That's a ball park with that, I'm pretty happy we've

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
set the origin in the middle there. I am going to have to scale that down a little bit further,

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
probably there. And I don't think I'm going to be that lucky

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
lining this lot up this time. Although, because we've got the

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
8 and 8, they actually line up perfectly! So it wasn't me being lucky, it was just

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
how we've made our model. Brilliant! So there we go, that's much better!

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's zoom back out, I'm going to flip it into Perspective Mode,

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
as well, just to check it out in that view, and yeah, I'm happy with the

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
proportions there. So let's Join it again! Excellent!

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,300
I'm really happy with that low poly pawn,

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,333
and I'd like you guys to share yours in the

78
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,333
discussions. So take a screenshot and pop that in there, so I can see how you're getting

79
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:17,333
on. Take care, and I will see you in the next lecture!
