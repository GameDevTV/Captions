Hey guys, welcome to

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.766
section 4! We're very excited, because we know how much you're going to be learning in this

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:11.766
section! What are we building, Mikey, what models? Oh, we're going to build a chess set, so

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.766
we're actually going to build a series of models. So we're going to have multiple objects floating about

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.766
here, we're going to have a chess board itself and then all the associated pieces

6
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:23.766
with the chess board, and we're going to bring them all together in one big scene, at the very end.

7
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:27.766
We're going to apply textures, so this is the first time you guys are going to experience

8
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:31.766
textures in the course. We've already covered materials in the last one, so we're going to add a

9
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:35.766
texture to both our board and pieces. And there's two ways we're going to make

10
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.766
these textures. For the wood of the outside of the board, we're going to import an image from

11
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:43.766
the outside, which is quite a common way of using textures, and use that to get the grain to the wood.

12
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:47.766
And then, the marble in the middle on the board, it's going to be created by

13
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.766
Blender. The texture will be procedurally created by Blender, using its Blender Render

14
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:55.766
material shader, which is pretty cool! So you'll see that, and then, I'm going to be

15
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.766
helping you to export your materials out to a different program and look at the impact,

16
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.766
when you have both shader settings and textures that you need to export,

17
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:07.766
how does that get done. So that's it! So without further ado, let's

18
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:11.766
crack on and carry on, making our chess set! See you soon!
