Congratulations

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.200
guys, you've got a wonderful chess set all made up there! Now, we had some learnings

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.200
not only with Blender itself but with keeping things lean, as we go. And what

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.200
are those major learnings, Ben? Well when we got to the first piece

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.200
that had this geometric issue, this fact that the quad or your piece of geometry was

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.200
not flat, right? Yes! It had a non-planer piece of geometry! Yes! When we rendered

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.200
it up it looked horrible! And it looked really weird and it created all of those triangles,

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.200
and we found out about that because we rendered. So we found out about it because we took

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.200
it to the end result, i.e. the rendered final result, and

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.200
we didn't find out about it until we did that. So this is the whole point of taking your

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.200
model all the way to the final result, because you don't know what sort of unexpected things like that

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.200
you're going to come across. Now, it just so happens, either through good course design or through

13
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.200
pure chance, I'll leave it to you to decide, that that first happened when we got to

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.200
a piece that had that geometry. So the important thing is, keep testing the whole

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200
process all the way through. And yes, we've learned lots in this section that we're going to be

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.200
able to apply in the next one, as well. So take care guys, you've been

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.200
brilliant, up to this point! Remember to share in the discussions, and we'll see you

18
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.766
in the next section! See you soon, guys!
