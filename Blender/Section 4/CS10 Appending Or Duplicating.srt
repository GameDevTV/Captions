00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Appending or Duplicating!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So in this video we're going to learn when you would duplicate

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
an asset model and choose when appending would

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
be better. So Duplicating vs Appending!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So when you append another .blend file into a

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
brand new .blend file or another one that you're working on, appending picks

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
out key parts of a .blend file, so you can pick the object,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
materials, the textures, any other of the scene

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
information but you bring them in one by one, so other scene data

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
would have to be appended separately. Now, with

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
duplicating, as the word suggests, would be exactly

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the same as the original file, with everything

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
intact. It's essentially the same starting

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
file both times. So there are times when you would duplicate,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and there are times when you would append, depending on your circumstances,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
certainly after you are dealing with only a very basic

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
level, at the moment. If you're dealing with more than

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
two separate objects, separate .blend files, and you're

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
moving them all into one scene, then you're certainly going to need to

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
<<<<<<< HEAD:Blender/Section 4/CS10 Appending Or Duplicating.srt
append, at that point. You can't just keep duplicating because that's it, you've got the original scene.

append, at that point.; you can't just keep duplicating because that's it, you've got the original scene.

21
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:24,833
So I'd like you to create the rest of the pawn! So

22
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:28,833
duplicate the base piece .blend file. So we're not going to

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:32,833
append it, and the reason why we're going to duplicate is so we preserve

24
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,833
that background image that we've put in place, so that later on,

25
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,833
in a few moments, we can create the rest of the pawn against that material.

26
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,833
So make sure you're working on the new .blend file that you've created, so you

27
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,833
want to name it, straight away, and recommend a sphere for

28
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,833
the top of the pawn, rather than doing it any other way. Finally, complete

29
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,833
that pawn and share it with us in the discussions! Pause the video

30
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,100
now, and give that a go!

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,866
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop straight on over

32
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,500
into Blender!

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,500
So here we are in Blender, and I am going

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
to go and open up the Chess Piece Base that we've been working on.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,500
There we go! Brilliant! So I'm going to duplicate

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
this file, rather than append it, and the main reason

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
for that, more than anything else, is our reference

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,500
material is already placed in this scene. So if we move

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
around to the Front and pop it into

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,800
Orthographic projection.

41
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,466
There we go! [Laughs] And turn up the Opacity of our image,

42
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:43,466
I almost lost it there, then, we can see our pawn is

43
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:47,466
ready there for us. Now, if we were to append it into a new piece,

44
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:51,466
we'd also have to append this background image and adjust it again

45
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:55,466
to fit our current base, and we certainly don't want to do that,

46
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,466
at the moment, since it's already there. So I'm going to go to File and

47
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:03,466
Save As, and I'm just going to call this Chess

48
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:07,466
and then change it to Pawn. There we go!

49
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:11,466
So Save As Blender File, and I'm just going to check at the top, Chess Pawn.

50
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:15,466
Brilliant! So we're working on a brand new file now, so the

51
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:19,466
first thing I'm going to do is grab the very top of this

52
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:23,466
and simply extrude it up. So hopping into Edit

53
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:27,466
Mode, I'm going to grab that surface face at the

54
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:31,466
top there, pop straight back around here, and raise it

55
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:35,466
all the way up to there. Brilliant! I'm just going to add

56
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:39,466
some loop cuts in, I'm not quite sure how many I want. There's a nice curve

57
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:43,466
there, I'm going to need a few towards the top, that'll do for the

58
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:47,466
moment, I can work on the rest. So that will slope down to about there. Then,

59
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:51,466
it comes in and there's a lot of detail here, so I'm going to select a loop

60
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:55,466
edge there and bring this up. And I'm going to bring this other one up

61
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:59,466
really close, as well, just so I can add

62
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:03,466
more detail there. We may need to adjust things as we go, anyway.

63
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:07,466
And finally, I'm just going to lift this one, select that loop

64
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:11,466
there, edge loop there, move it up to roughly the middle

65
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:15,466
of this and just scale it into roughly the right

66
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:19,466
place. I'm going to zoom into our model and pan

67
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:23,466
up. I'm going to move this one and this one, at the same time,

68
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:27,466
inwards, so remember to hold down Shift when you're selecting

69
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:31,466
multiples of anything. I'm just going to scale them both

70
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:35,466
in to roughly the right place. I'm going to grab

71
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:39,466
this edge loop here, move it down slightly. I'm just trying to

72
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:43,466
match up the photo the best I can and move that bit out,

73
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:47,466
and that's absolutely fine! I just need to scale this

74
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:51,466
top one in a little. In fact, I want a little

75
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:55,466
resting place for where the sphere will meet, so I'm not going to

76
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:59,466
scale it into an absolute point, but I'm going to scale it in quite a bit,

77
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,466
probably to there. Now, this is obviously quite jagged,

78
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:07,466
so there's a couple of options we can do in there. I'm going to add

79
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:11,466
a bevel in here, just to smooth it out a little bit.

80
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:15,466
Now, it's just going to be about that much of a bevel, and there we

81
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:19,466
go! So that produces a nice smooth curve around there! Now, this one

82
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:23,466
is very pointy, and we may have to play with it quite a bit

83
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:27,466
to get it how we want it. I certainly

84
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:31,466
want one line through the middle, whatever happens,

85
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:35,466
and I can't really go any further than that, so I think I'm going to have to

86
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:39,466
add in some extra geometry, before we do this. So let's add in

87
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:43,466
another loop cut up here

88
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:47,466
and scale that out slightly

89
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:51,466
and add another loop cut underneath and scale that

90
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:55,466
out, as well, so then, it's not quite so

91
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:59,466
blocky. I'm just going to lift this up for no

92
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:03,466
other reasons than ease of use. So I'm going to pop that pretty much

93
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:07,466
in the middle, and then, I'm going to select all of these

94
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:11,466
edge loops, there and there, and apply

95
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:15,466
a bevel to that, as well. Not much but

96
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:19,466
just enough to smooth that out. And of course, what I haven't

97
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:23,466
been doing is hopping quickly on over into Object Mode. I'm just going to

98
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,466
turn... I don't need to turn that off, just to see how that's looking!

99
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:31,466
And I'm actually quite hoppy, happy, with how that's

100
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:35,466
looking, at the moment! So we just need to concentrate on the sphere that goes on top.

101
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,433
So let's move quickly around into Front

102
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:42,433
View again, and we're going to create a sphere. Now, I'm going to create it as a separate

103
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:46,433
object. Now, that's important because that will allow us to mate

104
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:50,433
these two surfaces together, if they're all one mesh, that can be quite

105
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:54,433
difficult. So I'm going to go Shift A,

106
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:58,433
Add a Mesh, and Add a UV Sphere. I'm going to move

107
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:02,433
that up and place it roughly on there,

108
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:06,433
and I'm going to have to scale that down.Â I'm literally using the image as

109
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,433
pure reference material here, to get the sizes as close

110
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:14,433
as I care to make them. Now, there's obviously a difference here, so what we're

111
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,433
going to do, at this point, is go and I'm going to

112
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:22,433
hide the Image, by just rotating away slightly. And this might be

113
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:26,433
a little fiddly but I'm going to turn on the Snap and

114
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:30,433
Face, and I'm simply going to move our

115
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:34,433
sphere down on top of this face. So I'm going to hit the

116
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:38,433
G Key and press Z to lock it on the Z axis

117
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:42,433
and literally just move it down, level with that face, and you can see it snapping

118
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:46,433
straight in and flipping around. I can see that's touching perfectly!

119
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,433
So one final thing that I do want to do, to make this thing just

120
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:54,433
a little neater is, I'm going to now turn off

121
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,433
our reference material. In fact, I could

122
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:02,433
delete it... Nooo, I'll probably just turn it off! So we've got

123
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:06,433
this point here, nothing in real life would ever exist like that, it can't

124
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:10,433
possibly just come to an infinitely small point. So I'm

125
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,433
going to hop into Edit Mode on our sphere, grab this

126
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,166
edge loop that runs around the bottom of our

127
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,900
sphere, and literally lower that

128
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,466
down, so it snaps onto the face, as well. So we're still on the Snapping Tool

129
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,333
here, which is great! We don't need to turn it off, unless you're going to press G, because we're moving

130
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,333
that set, and I'm going to press Z, because I only want it to move

131
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,333
up and down. I'm simply going to lower that onto this face, and there

132
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,333
we go, it snaps straight away! So then, when we view it from the side, we can see

133
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:43,333
there's a good contact point. Now, I'm going to

134
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,333
go straight back to this bit here, and I'm just going to move

135
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,333
this top bit in. So I'm going to go into Edit Mode, because I do want it to match,

136
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,333
and I'm going to select this top edge loop,

137
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,333
in edge select. And I'm not going to do it to Face, I'm going to

138
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,333
try and do it to Vertex and see if we can match one of these ones coming in. So I'm just

139
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,333
going to scale it in, see if we can snap that edge, so it's a nice, smooth,

140
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:11,333
curve going in. And I'm just going to add

141
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,333
another edge loop here and scale it out, so it's just not quite

142
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,333
as slanted going in. Alright, I

143
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,333
like that lots, there's a slight difference here. We are still dealing with

144
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:27,333
two models, so the first thing I am going to do is combine

145
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,333
these together. So I'm going to select, hop into Object Mode,

146
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,333
and then, I'm going to make sure I've got both selected,

147
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,333
and I'm going to go down to Object and Join

148
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:43,333
or Control and J. I'd forgotten what the shortcut was! Good

149
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,333
job, I knew where the menu option was. So we're dealing with objects and we're

150
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,333
going to join them together and that makes them one mesh. And of course, they're called

151
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:55,333
Sphere, which is no good anymore, so I'm simply going to call it

152
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:59,333
Pawn because I'm happy with that. And as we

153
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,333
can see here, this one hasn't got the smooth shading applied to it yet,

154
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:07,333
so over, making sure you're in Object Mode, over in the Tool

155
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:11,333
Shelf I'm simply going to click on smooth shading, so it's just a bit easier on the
