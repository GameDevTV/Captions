00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,766
Welcome to Zoom to Mouse & Rotate

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:06,766
Around Selection! So in this video these two

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:10,766
are great for working around more complex scenes,

4
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:14,766
as our chess board is slowly becoming. Now, we are changing

5
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:18,766
the user preferences with this, so if you wanted this to apply

6
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:22,766
again and again and again to all of the models you're creating, you will need to

7
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:26,766
remember to save your user preferences, otherwise they won't update.

8
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:30,766
And we're going to demonstrate both Zoom to Mouse and Rotate Around

9
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:34,766
Selection and also some other view options that are available,

10
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:38,766
because you can get in a bit of a muddle when you're using

11
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:42,766
these two, or in fact, just in general when you're zooming in and out

12
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:46,766
of a model. You may come to a point where you can't zoom any further and

13
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:50,766
that is really irritating, and we'll show you some ways to get around that.

14
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:54,233
So let's hop straight on over into Blender!

15
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:58,233
So the first thing that I want to do is just pull the Outliner

16
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:02,233
back in, slightly, so we can see more of our 3D view. Now,

17
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:06,233
by default, when you hold down the Middle Mouse Button and rotate around, it usually

18
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,233
rotates around the center of our scene, which is the center of the board, in this case,

19
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:14,233
where X, Y, and Z all equal 0. And zooming is also

20
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:18,233
done to that, until you move the viewport and

21
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:22,233
pan around, and then, we can zoom back in. Now, there are better ways

22
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,066
of doing that.

23
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,633
So go to File

24
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:29,300
and go into your User Preferences, and under the

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Interface, the second column has View Manipulation.

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,300
And there are two options, which by default are unticked, which are

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Zoom To Mouse Position and Rotate Around Selection.

28
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
If we turn both of those on and Save our User Settings,

29
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,300
we can hop back into Blender, and all of a sudden,

30
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,300
you can see zooming, for instance, is dependent on where

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,300
our cursor is. So if I put it over one of these other pawn's

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,300
heads and zoom in, it will zoom towards there. Now, that is incredibly

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,300
powerful, when you're working on other models! Rotation, however,

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,300
will be around the selected model, in this case. Now,

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,300
you'll want to play with this and see if it suits you or not. If you find it's

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,300
not suiting you and you'd rather go back to the other system, then that's fine,

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,300
you turn those off. These are all view options, i.e.

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,300
they're optional. Occasionally, you can end up with some weird stuff

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,300
going on. So I've zoomed into this one here and I'm going to rotate around,

40
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,300
and if I wanted to go to this one on the end, you won't go very far before

41
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,300
your zoom runs out, which is a little bit annoying. There are a couple of

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,300
ways around that though, and usually it involves resetting

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,300
the viewport itself to another place. And

44
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,300
one of the easiest ways to do that is, select another object, so I've selected

45
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,300
this bishop, over in the corner, going down to View, and

46
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,300
going to View Selected or Numberpad and the full stop on the Numberpad,

47
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,300
if you've got a full size keyboard. And you can see, it puts our bishop,

48
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,300
the selected object, in the center of our viewport,

49
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,300
and then, because we've got Rotate Around the Selected turned on,

50
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,300
we can rotate around there and edit to our hearts content! A

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,300
couple of other ways of getting out that and very useful to go through your

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,300
scene if necessary is one that's called the Viewport Dolly

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,300
and one is Walk or Fly Mode. Very exciting! So what

54
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,300
are they? Well first of all, let's rotate around, let's go to this

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,300
bishop... No that's a pawn isn't it? Let's go to the pawn on the end and zoom into it.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,300
We've run out of zoom again, so I'm [Laughs] going to go to View and View Selected. Great!

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,300
I'm going to rotate around, slightly, so I'm looking down, and I've got to remember it's perspective,

58
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,300
I'm going to pan across a little. So the Viewport Dolly is

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,300
very effective, in the way that it enables us to go down

60
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,300
our scene, by moving the viewport rather

61
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,300
than zooming in and out.  So if we hold down Shift and

62
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Control at the same time or Control and Shift, it doesn't matter which order,

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,300
and hold down the Mouse Button and move it in and out, we can go backwards

64
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,300
and forwards down our scene, which is

65
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,300
really really good; if you imagine these were buildings and you're walking down the street or indeed

66
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,300
this mouse eye view of our chess board. If you

67
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,300
hit the Control well, you'll notice is rotates around,

68
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,300
and if you hold down Alt, instead of Control, it rotates and pivots

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,300
the other way. So a couple of useful things there! The final one

70
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,300
is what's called Walk or Fly Mode, and

71
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,300
whether it's Walk or Fly is determined in the User Preferences. I'll show you where that

72
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,300
is now! So under File, User Preferences, under

73
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,300
I believe it's Input, and scroll down.

74
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,300
Here we go, View Navigation! We've got Walk and

75
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Fly! OK, so we're set to Walk, at the moment, let's see what that does!

76
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Shift and F will enable that and we can see a crosshair,

77
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,300
and if we use the W, S, A, and D

78
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,300
keys, much like a first person shooter, and the

79
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Q and E goes up and down. We can move through our scene quite easily!

80
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,300
Now, the other option, Fly, is a little harder to control

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,300
but is a little more versatile. So I'm going to Escape out

82
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,300
of that and go to File, User Preferences, and

83
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,300
just change that quickly to Fly mode and close that down.

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Now, when we go Shift and F to enable Fly Mode,

85
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,300
it's ever so slightly different. So our cursor enables us

86
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,300
to move around, and the further we stray from that center point,

87
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,300
the quicker the view moves. And we can move forward by pressing W,

88
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,300
and then, the Scroll Wheel itself speeds us up

89
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,300
and slows us down, in fact, it pops us in reverse, as well. and

90
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Very quickly, you can start panning around your model with

91
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,300
quite a bit of precision, and this is great, but it can

92
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,300
get a bit... [Laughs] Whoah, there we go! It can get a bit cumbersome,

93
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,033
at times,

94
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,966
but once you get control

95
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:07,966
over this, it's very very powerful! And you've got two options here,

96
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:11,966
if I want this to be our current view I can hit Enter. If I hit

97
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:15,966
Escape, it'll go back to the previous view. So if I hit Escape, it's going

98
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:19,966
back to where we started. If I just quickly move us around a little

99
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:23,966
more, it doesn't really matter where, let's come to a stop and look up at

100
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,966
our ever so tall bishop. Ooh, I've gone through the floor! As I said, it can be a little

101
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:31,966
bit cumbersome. If I hit Enter, that is our new view, and if I

102
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:35,966
select that, because we've got rotation on, there we go it's back to center.

103
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:38,200
so, great fun to be had there!

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,200
OK, so a quick summary of the View

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Options there! So you can use the View, View Selected, in order to

106
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,200
zoom in to the particular object or objects you

107
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,200
have selected. You can control the view in a View Dolly,

108
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
by holding down Control and Shift and using the Middle Mouse Button to Dolly

109
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,200
along the view you have, and you can also use Control and Shift

110
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,200
plus the + and - keys to do that. And finally, Walk or Fly Mode,

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,200
using Shift and F, adds a whole new dimension to moving

112
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
around your object. I particularly like flying through, even though it

113
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
is a bit cumbersome.

114
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,100
OK, so a quick challenge for you guys, and that is try out

115
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,100
the View Options! So go through what we've just done, have fun

116
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,100
with the View Options, try a couple of the different options that you have there,

117
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,100
and if I haven't said options enough, stick with what you

118
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,100
like! They are options, OK, you don't have to have them set

119
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,100
exactly the same as me. However, if you see me rotating around an object

120
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,100
and you're wondering, how are you doing that when it's over there, you now know

121
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,100
why it's set like that, so I can quickly zoom in and out

122
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,100
of my scene and rotate around selected objects.

123
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,100
So pause the video now, give that a go, and have some fun!

124
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,433
OK, welcome back! I hope you

125
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:02,433
had fun playing about with those options! Remember if you have any

126
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:06,433
questions to ask in the discussions, and I will see you in the next lecture!
