00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,866
Welcome to Selecting Hidden Geometry! So in this

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:07,866
video we're going to learn how to select geometry that isn't visible to us

3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:11,866
in our viewport, in front of us. Now, there are two straight forward

4
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:15,866
ways of doing that. Number one, we can switch the viewport shading

5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,733
to Wireframe Mode.

6
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:21,500
Number two, we can toggle Limit Selection to Visible.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,300
Then finally, we'll go on to build the rest of our bishop. Let's

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,000
hop over straight into Blender!

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So we have our bishop coming along rather nicely here! So the

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
first thing I'm going to do is rotate it around to the Front

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
View, so we've got a good representation of our model.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, we need the reference material, we need to go get the background

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
image. And if we scroll down here to the background images, they're still turned

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
on, and currently it's set to the pawn, we don't want that.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In fact, we don't need or remove this image, we can just overwrite it by opeining up

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
a new image and navigating to our section

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
assets and applying the Staunton Bishop.png.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Excellent! So that's in there! Now, it does need to be scaled

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
up, because we can see here we've aleady made the base of our pawn

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or what was the pawn, now the bishop, the right size.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,133
And if we look down at the scale,

22
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:22,133
the Size down here of our Image, it's set to 3. Now, that's quite

23
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:26,133
convenient, not planned I assure you; that is convenient, because the

24
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:30,133
size of this was originally 3. We just need to change that to a 4 and it should

25
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:34,133
match. Yeah, matches perfectly! Brilliant! So

26
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:38,133
now, on the Y axis we just need to shift that up. Let's hope that's another

27
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:42,133
whole number. I'm happy with that! So we can

28
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:46,133
see here, these parts align almost perfectly, that's great, but

29
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:50,133
the bits at the top do not. We need to go in

30
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:54,133
and edit those and move them out. So I'm just going to collapse this back down a bit, so we've got some more

31
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:58,133
space. Alright, so using Border Select in

32
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:02,133
Edit Mode, so I'm going to switch over to Edit Mode. Using Boarder Select, I can

33
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:06,133
select all of that lot there. Now, I'm in Face Select, if I was in Edge I'd

34
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:10,133
have to go a little lower, and I can pull that up

35
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:14,133
to the right place. Ah, there's something weird going on here! Let's turn our model

36
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:18,133
around and have a look! Ah, that's gone all weird!

37
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:22,133
It's only moved half of our model. Now, it's kind of cool,

38
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:26,133
it's made it look kind of head shaped, with maybe a cravat or something around it, but that's

39
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:30,133
not what we want, be want it to be uniform pulled

40
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:34,133
up. Now, the reason for that is, I only selected what I could see here,

41
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:38,133
and of course, plus this face that was already selected. So I'm going to undo

42
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:42,133
that, so it's back to normal. Great!

43
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:46,133
I'm going to deselect everything, before I start, and then, switch back over into

44
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,133
Front View. Now, in order to make sure that we can select

45
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,133
our entire mesh, including the stuff behind, what we need to

46
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:58,133
do and two fold, we can either switch to Wireframe so we can see

47
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:02,133
through our model, then if we do the Border Select again

48
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,533
it selects everything.

49
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,300
The alternative is a little toggle,

50
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,300
so let's just hop back into Solid Mode,

51
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,300
because it disappears when you're in Wireframe Mode, and that's this option

52
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,300
to the right of the Edge, Vertices, and Face Select.

53
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,300
There's this little button here, which is Limit Selection to Visible.

54
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,300
So if you toggle that off, because it's by default

55
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,300
on, you can see that our model appears slightly translucent now,

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,300
and if we perform the same action where we select stuff, it selects

57
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,300
all through our model. So there's two options in manipulating our

58
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,300
model. Then, we can pull that up and down to our hearts' content!

59
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,300
So let's switch back over into Front View and see

60
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,300
how we're doing here! I don't really want to pull that other bit up, actually,

61
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,300
so let's push that back down. Let's do the Border Select around here.

62
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,300
Nope, let's do Edges, I like working with edges.

63
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,300
Deselect everything first and try that once more.

64
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,300
There we go! And I'm just going to pull that up, so that this bit here

65
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,300
is roughly where that is. Now, we're going to have to add some extra bits and bobs

66
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,466
here, in a moment. That's absolutely fine!

67
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:17,566
And I'd probably want to make it indent here

68
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:21,566
a little, just to keep that form going up. When it was shorter as a pawn, it was fine.

69
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:25,566
Now, it seems a bit static, I just want to give it a bit more shape

70
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:29,566
to it and define it! And we do need to manipulate the top of this

71
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:33,566
pawn, as well. Now, we're going to leave out the notch for now, and we'll go and

72
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:37,566
do a cool thing, in a bit, to apply the notch! And we

73
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,966
need a little ball on top, as well.

74
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:42,133
OK guys, it's challenge time!

75
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:46,133
What I'd like you to do, if you haven't done it already, do import the bishop's

76
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:50,133
reference image and scale it appropriately and move it about. Then,

77
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:54,133
model the rest of the bishop. Do leave out the notch. Try

78
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:58,133
it out using different techniques, so you can put loop cuts in there, you can extrude

79
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:02,133
things. You may have to delete things as you go, as well, and possibly even

80
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:06,133
bridging edge loops, that may help you out. Have fun and

81
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:10,133
do keep the low poly in mind, so don't go adding a ton of geometry!

82
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:14,133
And use your own artistic license, as to what details you do

83
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:18,133
include towards the top of the bishop and which ones you don't. So

84
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:22,133
pause the video now and go off and create the bishop!

85
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:26,133
OK welcome back! Let's hop back over

86
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,133
into Blender!

87
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:32,133
OK, so back over in Blender, we've got this bit level here, and I feel

88
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:36,133
like we could almost move this ball completely out of the way,

89
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:40,133
if we did some decent selection there. So I'm going to clear everything

90
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:44,133
and see if we can just lift that up. So Border Select, I'm going to select everything there,

91
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:48,133
and I suppose the only other thing I need to select here is this vertex in the middle.

92
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:52,133
Has that worked? Let's shift that up. Yes brilliant,

93
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:56,133
it has! I'm going to shift that to the top

94
00:05:56,133 --> 00:06:00,133
of our... Ooh, I'm grabbing stuff, I don't want to do that!

95
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,633
Escape out of it!

96
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,900
So I thought I was grabbing that blue arrow and I wasn't. Let's

97
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,000
select that again

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and move it down to roughly the right point. So that's the top of

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,633
our mesh here, and this is the bottom.

100
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,833
Now, becuse this sphere, on the top, is made

101
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,833
of the same number of segments as our piece down here, we can use Bridges

102
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,833
Loops to get this bit melded onto this bit at the bottom here.

103
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,833
So all I need to do here is delete this vertex at the bottom.

104
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,833
So I'm going to delete that now and make sure it's deleting vertices only. We end up with a

105
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,833
hole in the top of our model there, and making sure we don't have an

106
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,833
inside face, I'm going to select this face here

107
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,833
and make sure I only delete the face and nothing else.

108
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,833
So then, selecting these two edge loops, that one there and this one

109
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,833
here and going to Mesh, Edges, and Bridge

110
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,833
Edge Loops. And there we go... Nope, select these two edge loops...

111
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,833
I didn't hold down Shift, when doing that! I should know better by now.

112
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,833
So Bridge Edge Loops. So there we go! That's the mesh,

113
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,833
now all as one, which is brilliant! So the next thing we need to do

114
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,833
is just hop back into the Front View and have a look at

115
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,833
our model and see how we're getting on. So this bit here is far too high,

116
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,833
so we can start moving some of these edge loops now. So let's grab this one

117
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,833
and move it down to about there. We can grab

118
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,833
this particular one here and scale it out.

119
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,833
I'm quite happy with kind of that shape there, although it would be quite

120
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,833
nice to add maybe another edge loop in. Ooh, not rotating but another edge

121
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,833
loop around there, just to define this

122
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,833
indent we have here. And that's almost the bottom

123
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,833
of the bishop's hat, which makes it much more defined,

124
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,833
by adding that extra edge loop in. So not much detail but just

125
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,833
enough to define that! And then finally, we've got the wrong taper

126
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,833
here, so I think all we need to do here is bring these edge loops

127
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,833
down and perhaps scale that in, ever so slightly,

128
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,833
and then, bring this one down a lot to make it far more pointy. There we

129
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,833
go! So the only thing we're missing now is the little bit

130
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,833
of the... What shall we call it? The little bobble on top of

131
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,833
the hat. It's like a snow hat or something like that. So in this case, we can

132
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,833
just add in a sphere, a UV Sphere,

133
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,833
similar to everything else, but we're going to lower these Segments and Rings

134
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,833
all the way down to nothing. Well not nothing but as low as they go!

135
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,833
And we really want to match the segments to the rest of the

136
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,833
hat here, so let's up that to 8 in total

137
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,833
and just scale it down to see how it looks. It needs to be a lot smaller,

138
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:48,833
probably about that big. Now finally, we want to

139
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,833
meld this object to the top here. So we need to

140
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,833
turn on Snapping and make sure we've got Vertex

141
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,833
selected, which is brilliant, and then, we can grab this and move it about and

142
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,833
plunk it against the vertex. And now that's pinged straight to the right point, straight

143
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,833
away! It doesn't always do that, you can always lock it into the Z

144
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,833
axis and move it up and down, and then, it often will behave for you

145
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,833
perfectly. So I'm going to attach that there. Brilliant! The next thing

146
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,833
I need to do is hop out of that. I'm going to turn off this

147
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,333
Limit Selection Visibality and just have a

148
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,333
look at that! Now, something tells me that's gone a bit wonky, at the top there!

149
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:30,333
OK, it has! So what has gone on there, that seems

150
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,333
to get a little closer. Let's pop back into...

151
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,333
Well let's have a look at this. I don't think we placed our

152
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,533
model in the right place.

153
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:43,933
In this case, I think we can resurrect our

154
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:47,933
problem, we can create it again, but I can see here over in the Transform, on the

155
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:51,933
Properties, the X and Y coordinates. I'm happy with the Z, it's spot on,

156
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:55,933
but the X and Y aren't 0. So I think, it's just a raw guess, at this point,

157
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:59,933
by moving those exactly there we'll have it perfect,

158
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,933
and that's starting to look much better. So let's zoom out and look at our bishop as a
