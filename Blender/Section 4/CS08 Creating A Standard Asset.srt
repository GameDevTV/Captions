00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Welcome to

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Creating a Standard Asset! In this video we're going

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,800
to choose a style of chess set. Then, we're going to decide

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,800
on a construction method and then start creating

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,800
our asset. So I'm going to pick

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,800
a standard competition chess set, which is I believe

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,800
is pronounced Staunton chess set, and this photo

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,800
is taken from Wikipedia, the author down below there, Frank A. Camaratta.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Thank you for taking this wonderful photo for us! So we're going to use

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,800
this as, well I'm going to use this as my base. You can use a different type of

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,800
chess set, if you would like. Bear in mind, this is still going to be a low

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,800
poly chess set, we're not going to go over the top with detail at this level

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,800
in the course. Alright, our construction method! We're going

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,800
to split our models into two, so we're going to

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,800
make a standard base asset that we can work from

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,800
for all of the other models. If we just go back quickly to this

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,800
image, you can see that the bases across all of the models

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,800
are very similar. Some of them are slightly taller, before they

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,800
reach that little bump around the top where the neck comes out,

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,800
some of them are a little more squat, but essentially, they're the same

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,366
basic mesh and that's what we're going to create!

22
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:23,100
OK, so a challenge for

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,100
you, straight away! I'd like you to import a reference image!

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,100
So create a new Blender file named Chess Piece Base,

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,100
because that's what we're going to be working on. I'd like you to go ahead and,

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,100
if you haven't done it already, please download your asset pack and import the

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,100
Staunton Pawn.png as your background image. I

28
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,100
do suggest you use a cylinder of the right size for reference.

29
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Since the base of the pawn is going to be 3

30
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,100
across, it'll have a radius of 1.5, a little hint for you there.

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,100
And finally, leave the cylinder in the scene, as we're going to use that

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,100
for block modeling later. Pause the video now and give that a

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,100
go! OK guys, welcome back! Let's

34
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,666
hop straight on over into Blender!

35
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:14,666
So here we are in Blender! I'm immediately going to get

36
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,666
rid of our cube, I don't need that in the scene. And I'm going

37
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,666
to Add a Mesh object that is a Cylinder,

38
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,666
and in the Operator Panel, before I do anything else, I'm

39
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:30,666
going to set the Radius to 1.5.

40
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,666
Once the Radius is set to 1.5, there are a couple of other

41
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,666
design decisions that I can make, like the number of Vertices, etc.

42
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,666
Now, at the moment in time, I think that's going to be plenty big enough for

43
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,666
the base of our pawn we're about to do.

44
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,666
So let's now import our image!

45
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:53,866
I'm going to go into our Properties Panel

46
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:57,866
on the 3D Editor, scroll all the way down to Background Images, and

47
00:02:57,866 --> 00:03:01,866
Add an Image. I would suggest that you now go

48
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:05,866
to your Assets Pack. If you've not already downloaded it, please go

49
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:09,866
and download it, otherwise you won't be able to complete this task, and then,

50
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:13,866
grab your Staunton Pawn.

51
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:17,866
There we go, so we've got that there! Open the image, and of course, we won't see it

52
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:21,866
unless we're in Orthographic Projection and looking from one of the

53
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:25,866
side views. Excellent! So we've got our image in the scene and we've got

54
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:29,866
our reference cylinder here. So we're going to have to do a couple of things

55
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:33,866
to this image, and the first one's going to be scaling it down. So I'm just going to zoom

56
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:37,866
in, so I can see what's going on.

57
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:41,866
All the way there! OK, that's about right!

58
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:45,866
Now, I want the image on the base, where X and Y equal

59
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:46,366
0.

60
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:50,333
OK, so we'll just need to shift this pawn upwards

61
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,333
a little, this reference pawn, and let's lift it up.

62
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:58,333
Let's lift this up, as well, by 1.

63
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,333
I could have done that in a number of ways, I'm just going to translate it by 1 there,

64
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,333
and I'm going to change to Wireframe Mode, so I can just see our image behind, because

65
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,333
otherwise I can't see the image. [Laughs] It's as simple as that. Or I could put it in front,

66
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,333
of course, that would help and change the Opacity, just turn it

67
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:18,333
down a lot really, so I can just see where it is. Now, I've cropped these images

68
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:22,333
for you, so they're nice and easy to look at.

69
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:26,333
Let's just turn the Opacity up a little

70
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,333
bit more. Yeah, that's pretty much on the base, so I'm happy with that!

71
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:34,666
And the final thing that I'm going to do here is just

72
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:38,666
zoom in a little, and I'm going to grab this top and lower it to this

73
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:42,666
little ridge here, that's really, for me, where this base ends.

74
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:46,666
So I'm just going to rotate around a little and

75
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,666
grab this top edge loop here. So I'm going to switch into Edit Mode

76
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,666
and select that edge loop around the top, and then

77
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,666
flick straight back around, so I can see what we're doing. I'm just going to use the blue

78
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,666
arrow here and lower it to the right level. So there we go, we've got a

79
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,666
cylinder! We haven't modeled anything yet, apart from the general shape. We've got a cylinder

80
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:11,533
aligned to our reference image, and we're ready for the next lecture!

81
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,100
But before we move on, let's just make sure that we've named

82
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,100
our asset correctly. So let's scroll down. It's not called a Cylinder

83
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,100
anymore, we'll call this Chess Piece

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Base. Why not, that sounds good to me! And then, finally

85
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,800
we will go ahead and save our

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,333
Blender file! So we will call this one...

87
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,333
Let's go into my project folder and call it Chess

88
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,333
Piece Base. I suggest you do that same now

89
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,333
and make sure

90
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,433
it is saved to your project folder. Brilliant!

91
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,866
Please share what you've done in the discussions, and

92
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,533
I will see you shortly!
