00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to the 3D Cursor

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and Origins! So in this video we're going to take another

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
look at our reference pieces, and we're going to look for some commonality,

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to save us time with our modeling. And finally, we're going

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to use the 3D Cursor and the Origin, associated

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with an object, to accurately control our piece.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So let's go back to our chosen dimensions that we

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
had a look at earlier! And we've already done our pawn, and that's 3 centimeters, the base

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is well 3 Blender units, in this case. Now, all the other

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
pieces, bar the king, have a 4 centimeter base,

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and that's what we've picked. And that is a 1/3 larger, again, it's

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
33% larger. So when we go and scale in a bit, we will need to scale by

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
1.333333, etc. And I'm not quite

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
sure how many 3's we're going to need, we can have a look anyway and see as we go!

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So let's hop on over to my file system,

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.400
where we can have another look at our pieces!

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.100
So looking at our pieces, we can see that the bishop

18
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.100
itself and the king and the

19
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.100
pawn and the queen have a very similar neck line,

20
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
all up to this bit along the top. So just beneath the ball

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.100
on here, we've got this little plate it sits on. Now, I'm pretty

22
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.100
certain that if we grabbed the bishop's head and replaced it

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.100
with a ball well it would look pretty similar, you wouldn't be able to distinguish

24
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.100
between the two unless you saw them in situation, and the same

25
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.100
with the king. So I think we can use our pawn

26
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.100
base, all the way up to this top bit of the neck here,

27
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.100
and then, build upon that to make the rest of our pieces.

28
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.100
Now that's done! We just archived away our pawn, but we can go and retrieve it and

29
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.733
start using it to make the rest of our model.

30
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:53.666
The exception to this, of course,

31
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:57.666
is the knight itself, which is geometrically, completely, different from the

32
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:01.666
rest of the pieces, apart from its base, and the rook itself,

33
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:05.666
which has sort of no top to it. It's got these castlements

34
00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:09.666
on top. So, let's hop straight on over into blender

35
00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:14.766
OK, so now we're in Blender! I've just opened it up afresh,

36
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:18.766
and fortunately, my Low Poly Pawn is still in my recent files, so I'm

37
00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:22.766
happy to go open that there! If yours isn't, go to your project folder in your archive

38
00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:26.766
folder, because we just archived it. Feel free to pull it back out into the working folder,

39
00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:30.766
if you want. I'm just going to open it up, because we're going to save it in a few moments,

40
00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:34.766
as the new pieces. So I'm going to go straight over to our

41
00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:38.766
Outliner and change this to Bishop,

42
00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:42.766
and I'm going to go to File, Save As,

43
00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:46.766
and name it appropriately. So in this

44
00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:50.766
case, I'm going to put it in the current working folder and call it Low Poly Bishop or LP

45
00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:54.766
Bishop, in my case, and Save As Blender File. So

46
00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:58.766
I'm just going to amend this here and also put LP Bishop in the

47
00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:02.766
Outliner, just so it's really descriptive as what we're working on. This obviously

48
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:06.766
is not a bishop, at the moment, we need to do a couple of things. So

49
00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:10.766
looking at the reference material there, we need to scale

50
00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:14.766
this up slightly. So I'm going to do that straight away, I'm just going to hit the S button, and we know

51
00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:18.766
that we need to scale it up by 1.333 reoccurring.

52
00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:22.766
So let's have a look over here in the Properties Pane, if

53
00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:26.766
it's not open, open yours up with the N Key or the little +.

54
00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:30.766
And we have Dimensions here, and we can see X and Y are at 3,

55
00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:34.766
which is perfect because we want them at 4.

56
00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:38.766
So we could go and type in 4 there, to be quite honest, 4

57
00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:42.766
and 4, and it looks a bit squat but that's fine! But if

58
00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:46.766
we wanted to scale the whole lot at once, we'd have to work it, so let's

59
00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:50.766
undo that. We'd have to work out what this, multiplied by 1.3 is, and

60
00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:54.766
I really don't want to grab a calculator, at the moment. So I'm just going to scale up

61
00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:58.766
and go 1.3, and we can see that that

62
00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:02.766
produces 3.9. If we do another 3, it's 3.99, 3.999,

63
00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:06.766
and if we do to four decimal places, it's pretty

64
00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:10.766
much bang on 4, as far as Blender is concerned. Now, we've got

65
00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:14.766
a little problem here, because it's pushed it through the floor here!

66
00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:18.766
So we need to do a bit of jiggery pokery, to try and get this

67
00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:22.766
back onto the floor plane itself, so where Z

68
00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:26.766
equals 0. We can do that in a couple of ways! If you knew exactly

69
00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:30.766
the mathematics required you could adjust the Z,

70
00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:34.766
up here in the Transform, to be something other than 1, so it'd be something greater

71
00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:38.766
than 1, but that is the position of the origin of this

72
00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:42.766
object. So one of the things we could do is

73
00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:46.766
move the origin to the base of our

74
00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:50.766
pawn, in this case, but soon to be bishop. So there are a couple of ways of

75
00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:54.766
doing that, but one of the easiest ways to do it is to get

76
00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:58.766
the 3D Cursor, this thing here that you use with Left Mouse Button,

77
00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:02.766
and then, set the origin to it. So in the

78
00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:06.766
Tool Shelf, whilst in Object Mode, if we put the

79
00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:10.766
cursor over here and then go to where it says Set Origin and

80
00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:14.766
go Origin to 3D Cursor,

81
00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:18.766
it moves the origin to the 3D Cursor. Now, this is

82
00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:22.766
important, because this is used in so many factors including

83
00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:26.766
how it scales. So it's going to scale in and out towards that,

84
00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:30.766
it's also going to rotate around that, so it acts as a pivot point,

85
00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:34.766
as well. So that allows us to have lots of control! Now, having it all the way

86
00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:38.066
out there, in this case, isn't going to benefit us,

87
00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:40.600
and later on, when we start playing with physics

88
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.600
modeling, this will be the object's center of mass.

89
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.100
More on that later one! Now, we need to just move

90
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.100
it somewhere a bit more useful for us and that's the base of this pawn

91
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.566
or bishop, as it will soon be.

92
00:05:54.566 --> 00:05:57.366
So one of the things you can do here is literally

93
00:05:57.366 --> 00:06:01.366
start clicking on our object, and if we rotate around

94
00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:05.366
after you've clicked, you'll see that where you've clicked it

95
00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:09.366
kind of attaches itself to the face that you've clicked on. It's

96
00:06:09.366 --> 00:06:13.366
semi-intelligent, in that manner, so it works with us!

97
00:06:13.366 --> 00:06:16.800
And fortunately for us, we've got a big flat base on the

98
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.600
bottom of our object here. So if we click on

99
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.600
that, anywhere on that, that is actually perfectly on

100
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.433
that face.

101
00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:28.433
The other thing that we can do with the 3D Cursor is actually

102
00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:32.433
tell it where to go instead. So for instance, in

103
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:36.433
Edit Mode, if we select a particular point, edge

104
00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:40.433
or vertex, so if we select this vertex here, for instance

105
00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:44.433
this one here, we can then use the shortcut keys Shift

106
00:06:44.433 --> 00:06:48.433
plus S and that opens up this

107
00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:52.433
snapping menu for our 3D Cursor. When we do

108
00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:56.433
that, we can actually move the Cursor to the Selected, so we've popped

109
00:06:56.433 --> 00:07:00.433
the 3D Cursor smack bang on that vertex there.

110
00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:04.433
If we had an edge selected and we did the same

111
00:07:04.433 --> 00:07:08.433
thing, Shift S, and then, Cursor to Selected, it will go into the middle

112
00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:12.433
of that edge. And if we had a face selected, well you

113
00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:16.433
probably guessed it already, when we go to snap it with Shift and

114
00:07:16.433 --> 00:07:20.433
S, we can move Cursor to Selected and it appears in the

115
00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:24.433
middle of our face. So

116
00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:28.433
the final thing you can do is set this 3D Cursor back to 0, 0, 0,

117
00:07:28.433 --> 00:07:32.433
which is right in the middle of our

118
00:07:32.433 --> 00:07:36.433
model. Well not this particular model but in the middle of the scene where X, Y, and Z all

119
00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:40.433
equal 0. Now, you can do that in the

120
00:07:40.433 --> 00:07:44.433
Properties section over here.

121
00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:48.433
We scroll down, we've got our 3D Cursor position, it's location,

122
00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:52.433
and the shortcut, we can go into there and set them all to 0,

123
00:07:52.433 --> 00:07:56.433
but the shortcut is Shift and S. And then finally, Cursor

124
00:07:56.433 --> 00:08:00.433
to Center, and that will pop it where X,

125
00:08:00.433 --> 00:08:02.866
Y, and Z all equal 0.

126
00:08:02.866 --> 00:08:06.866
It's challenge time! OK guys, I'd like you to place the bishop

127
00:08:06.866 --> 00:08:10.866
on the ground. So I say ground, in inverted comments, but what I mean is so the

128
00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:14.866
bishop is actually where Z equals 0, so nothing is protruding

129
00:08:14.866 --> 00:08:18.866
beneath that grid. So I'd like you to scale the bishop's

130
00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:22.866
base to 4 Blender units in diameter, if you've not done it already. Then,

131
00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:26.866
set the origin to the base of the bishop.

132
00:08:26.866 --> 00:08:30.866
Then, set the base of our bishop to Z equals

133
00:08:30.866 --> 00:08:34.866
0. And there's extra credit, it's not necessary, but extra

134
00:08:34.866 --> 00:08:38.866
credit if you set the bishop's origin to (0,0,0).

135
00:08:38.866 --> 00:08:42.866
So that means that our bishop is really square in the scene!

136
00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:46.866
Pause the video now and give that a go! OK

137
00:08:46.866 --> 00:08:50.866
guys, welcome back! Let's hop straight on over into Blender!

138
00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:55.333
OK, so let's go about moving all of this stuff of

139
00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:59.333
this ground plane! So let's move around and just

140
00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:03.333
click on the base. So that is definitely on the base there, and then, we

141
00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:07.333
need to go into Object Mode. I'm not in Object Mode, at the moment, because

142
00:09:07.333 --> 00:09:11.333
the origin is changed there. So set the origin to the

143
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:15.333
cursor, Origin to 3D Cursor. Brilliant! So now, we

144
00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:19.333
have it on the base, over in the Properties Pane,

145
00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:23.333
we can see that Z equals -2.5.

146
00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:27.333
So if we set that to 0, it will lift that up to the

147
00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:30.866
right place, which is brilliant! That's now sitting on the ground!

148
00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:33.900
So the next thing we need to do is just move

149
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.900
the origin to the center. So as we can see there, it's not

150
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.933
quite there,

151
00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:42.733
the object is but the origin is not, so let's move the origin now

152
00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:46.733
to the center. So what we need to do, we're going to move the

153
00:09:46.733 --> 00:09:50.733
3D Cursor first, so Shift and S, Cursor to

154
00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:54.733
Center. Now that the cursor is in the center, we can then again

155
00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:58.733
go Set Origin to the 3D Cursor, and let's move that

156
00:09:58.733 --> 00:10:02.733
back to there. So now, the origin of our model is smack bang

157
00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:05.933
on the bottom, which in this case is great!

158
00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:08.400
Excellent! How did you guys get on?

159
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.866
Please share your progress

160
00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:14.133
in the discussions, and I will see you in the next lecture!
