Hello and welcome to

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,700
Managing a Larger Project! So in this video we're going

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,700
to learn how to manage a larger project. This is going to be

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,700
consisting of multiple objects, that we're all going to bring all

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,700
together at the end, so it's useful to know how to do that. So we're going to learn how to

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,700
store your files for quick recall and easy to find. And finally,

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,700
this is just a suggested workflow, if you do have something that works

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,700
for you that's something you've been doing for years and we're just preaching to the

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,700
converted, at this point, then carry on with that you don't have to adopt this

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,700
new methodology. Or it might be very similar to what you do already.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,700
So let's hop over to the operating system, at this

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,200
point, and just manage our project!

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Hi guys, and welcome to my operating system! So I'm on a

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Mac here and I use Finder. If you're on a Windows system,

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,200
you'll be using Windows Explorer to do a very similar job. I would suggest

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,200
that you have a structure. I've got two

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,200
chess set folders here, one for the videos and lectures that I'm doing for you guys

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,200
and one for the actual assets themselves, the pieces, the board,

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
etc. So I've got my section here and here! Now,

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I would suggest that you guys, if you haven't done it already, do create

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
yourself a project folder, and you don't have to call it Low Poly Chess Set, you

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,233
can simply call it Chess Set. Now, this

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
will help you lots, later on, as the course gets more

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
and more complex. So it's a great habit, if you've not started already,

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,500
to start managing your projects in this manner.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Alright guys, a quick challenge for you! I'd like you to go and create a Chess Set

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
project folder. So go and make a folder ready to store all of your Chess Set

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
in, as we go ahead and make it. Pause the video now and go off

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,366
and do that,

30
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:50,933
and I'll see you in a few seconds!

31
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:54,933
OK guys, welcome back! Thank you for going and creating that Chess Set

32
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:58,933
project folder! Let's crack on and start making this chess set!
