00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the Boolean Modifier! In this video

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we're going to experiment with a Boolean Modifier and understanding how it works!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're going to understand how to apply it to our model,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
learn that it can be used constructively and destructively.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It can and will work in Edit Mode, if you choose,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and also, it's real time and live, which is exciting, not all

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,533
modifiers are! So let's hop over, straight into Blender!

8
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:32,433
So before we start using this boolean modifier,

9
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:36,433
what we'll need to do is create another object in our scene. So

10
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:40,433
I'm going to place the 3D Cursor just somewhere random, over in space here,

11
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:44,433
and go and create us... I am in

12
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:48,433
Edit Mode, I will need to be in Object Mode, in this case. I know it works in Edit Mode,

13
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:52,433
but I do want to keep these separate to demonstrate. So

14
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:56,433
I'm going to hold down Shift and A and add a new Mesh of UV

15
00:00:56,433 --> 00:01:00,433
Sphere. Now, I'm going to set the Segments here down

16
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:04,433
massively. They don't need to be quite so high, maybe 8 and 4.

17
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:08,433
That feels about right, 184, 8 and 4.

18
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:12,433
Ah, I'm going to increase it just a little! There we go! And

19
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:16,433
here, too! So we're going to move this now, so it's against our

20
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:20,433
bishop. Now, let's just push it in,

21
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:24,433
and eventually it will go close and close and close, and I'm just going to grab it and move

22
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:28,433
it down there. Excellent!

23
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:31,633
So now that it's in our model, we can decide how we want to work.

24
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,666
Leaving the sphere there, we're going to shift this over a little

25
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,666
and go to our little spanner or Modifier Icon, and we'll

26
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,666
add a modifier. And again, it's in this second column, the Generate column,

27
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,666
and it's Boolean, just there. Once we click that,

28
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:51,666
we have to select an object to apply it to.

29
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:55,666
Now, boolean operations can only apply to other mesh objects.

30
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,666
So, in this case, we've got this mesh object here, the LP

31
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,666
Bishop, so we're going to put that in there. OK,

32
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,666
so the first thing that this has done is, we've now removed

33
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:11,666
anything that's not within our bishop itself.

34
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,666
And we can demonstrate that by applying it and then just moving it back

35
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,666
out. You'll see that we're left with a surface of the

36
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,666
bishop cut away from here, so we've

37
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:27,666
still got our sphere on this side but not on that side. So let's plunk it back in and

38
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:31,666
do a couple of steps, so we can work on there. If we shift into Wireframe

39
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,666
Mode, this is quite exciting, we can see it as it passes through. So if we

40
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,666
set the object back to Low Poly Bishop, we can see what

41
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,666
will be left as we're moving through. Quite cool!

42
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:47,666
And that's with it set to the Operation as Intersect.

43
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,666
What else do we have? We have Difference and

44
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,666
Union! Well Union, as it sounds, combines the two

45
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,666
together, so if we then applied this, that would become

46
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,666
one mesh without... As you can see there's no sphere inside.

47
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,233
Now, the Difference does

48
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:10,233
the exact opposite! It's going to cut away

49
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:14,233
the bishop shape from the sphere, and we can

50
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:18,233
demonstrate that again in Wireframe Mode. We see there's nothing left of our sphere,

51
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:22,233
and if we Apply that and move the sphere away, we've taken

52
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:26,233
a chunk out of the sphere but the other way this time.

53
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:30,233
Well, in this case, if we want to cut a hole in... Let's see how it applies

54
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,000
back on the bishop! So let's set our

55
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:37,166
sphere back into the bishop itself and this time select

56
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:41,166
the Bishop first, and then, Add a Modifier of type

57
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:45,166
Boolean and select the Object as the Sphere.

58
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:49,166
Ah, so with Intersect, it's cut out of the sphere. So

59
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:53,166
that's the opposite way, that was the Difference when it was the other way around.

60
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,166
Excellent! And let's try Union!

61
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:01,166
Well that's hopefully going to look the same as it did before. Yes,

62
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:05,166
it becomes one, after the operation! And Difference,

63
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:09,166
well that, after it's applied,

64
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,166
will eat away at our model. That's brilliant! That's exactly what

65
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:17,166
we want to see! Well it looks kind of like a spaceship or a hole in there. Perhaps,

66
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:21,166
if you wanted to make a hole in the bottom of a tree to hide in. Who knows!

67
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:25,166
So that's the boolean operator! I'm not going to

68
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:29,166
undo those changes, because I don't want to ruin my bishop,

69
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:33,166
and I'm going to delete

70
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:37,166
that Sphere. Excellent! Zoom back out. Yep, everything's

71
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:41,166
intact, I've not modified our bishop at all. So

72
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,166
challenge time!

73
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,300
I would like you to cut a notch in the

74
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,300
bishop! So using a boolean modifier, cut a notch

75
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,300
from the bishop's hat, in the top. If you need to have a look at reference material, to

76
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,300
make sure its placement is good, then go ahead and do that. Pause

77
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,300
the video now and give that a go! OK

78
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,300
guys, welcome back! Let's go cut a notch in the bishop's hat!

79
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,866
Alright, so the first thing I want to do is

80
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:12,866
just generate something and think about where it's going through.

81
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:16,866
So I want to make my notch diagonal, and I also want to make it

82
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:20,866
slightly wedge shaped. So I'm going to create myself

83
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:24,866
a new Mesh object in Object Mode,

84
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,866
so it's separate. Excellent! I'm going to make it more wedge

85
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:32,866
shaped, as well. I don't care about the scale, at the moment, I can play about with

86
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,866
that at will. So I'm going to pop into Edit Mode, grab

87
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:40,866
an edge like this one, and just move it in to make

88
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:44,866
a wedge. It doesn't need to be quite that

89
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:48,866
angled. We definitely don't want it that big! Probably more like

90
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:52,866
that! And the final thing I think I want to do is just

91
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:56,866
round it off ever so slightly, not much, this is going to

92
00:05:56,866 --> 00:06:00,866
spoil the geometry if I do that, maybe. Let's leave it like that and

93
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:04,866
see how that works! The next thing I want to do is move it closer

94
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:08,866
to my bishop itself. So I'm going to hop back over into

95
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:12,866
Object Mode, and move it about so it's almost in the right

96
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:16,866
place. I've still got snapping turned on, that could be useful in this case,

97
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:20,866
but not... Well it's close enough it's brought it to

98
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,866
our model. Let's pop it there and push it in.

99
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:28,866
We may need to scale this up and down as we go.

100
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:32,866
OK, that's looking good

101
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:36,866
there, however I want mine the other way

102
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:40,866
around. So I can just rotate that on

103
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:44,866
the Z axis by 180, and then, move it back here

104
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:48,866
in on the Y axis, back in. And that's

105
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,866
cutting in there and it looks a bit too deep a cut. I don't

106
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:56,866
really want to go beyond here, so I've got a couple of options there. In

107
00:06:56,866 --> 00:07:00,866
this case, I'm going to scale that only on the X, Y...

108
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:04,866
Nope, only on the Z axis I think.

109
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:08,866
So scale on the Z axis, rather than going to Wireframe.

110
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:12,866
Oh, I might not have left myself enough space, I must remember

111
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,866
that. Excellent! I do need it to come out, so

112
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:20,866
about there. I'm going to lift that back up and push it back ever so slightly,

113
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:24,866
and I do need to scale it, probably on the X axis at this point, so let's do that now!

114
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:28,866
Scale on the X axis just to push it out. I'm going to whiz

115
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,866
around the model, yep, that's all the way through our model! I'm just going to pull it

116
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:36,866
up, ever so slightly more, because we're still around there. Do

117
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:40,866
I want to chop off any of this little bobble

118
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:44,866
on the top? Maybe? And In this case not, so I'm just going to

119
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:48,866
rotate it away, to play with it a little further, and pull it out. And

120
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:52,866
I've exhausted my artistic license, at this point! Alright, I now

121
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:56,866
need to apply this! So I'm going to select the bishop first,

122
00:07:56,866 --> 00:08:00,866
and then, go to Add Modifier and Boolean.

123
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:04,866
I'm going to select the object that we're going to use, which is the Cube,

124
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:08,866
which is no longer a cube, and we don't want Intersect, we want Difference,

125
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:12,866
in this case. I'm going to Apply the Modifier, and

126
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:16,866
then, I've got two options. In this case I'm just going to hide the Cube, in case

127
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:20,866
it's not quite right. Oh, I like that lots! In fact,

128
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:24,866
I'd like it so much, I'm gong to do one final thing before I let that go.

129
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:28,866
I'm going to undo those changes and I'm

130
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:32,866
going to just adjust the Cube, ever so slightly. I'm going to rotate it

131
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:36,866
around the Y axis, so that our slice

132
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:40,866
comes through at a slight angle, which I think is going to

133
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:44,866
add a tiny bit of a dynamic to it and make it look that little bit better.

134
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:48,866
And I'm just going to move that back out so it's not touching. Alright, I'm

135
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:52,866
happy with that, so I'm going to Add my Modifier again, which is already there. In fact, all I need to

136
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,866
do now is Apply it! Excellent!

137
00:08:56,866 --> 00:09:00,866
I'm going to hide my Cube in the Outliner and just check that out again!

138
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:04,866
Brilliant! I've got exactly the slant that I wanted in my

139
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:08,866
bishop's hat! How did you guys get on? Please share in the

140
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:12,866
discussions, and I will see you in the next lecture!
