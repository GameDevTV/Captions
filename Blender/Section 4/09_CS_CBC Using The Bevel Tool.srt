00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Welcome to Using the Bevel Tool! In this video we're going to

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,700
box model the chess piece base and then using the bevel tool

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,700
to round off our sharp edges! So let's hop over

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,300
into Blender!

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,300
So here we are in Blender! So let's start

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,300
working on our shape here! So before, when we've

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,300
had a curvy shape like this we've used Bezier Curves, but I fancy doing this with

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,300
box modeling. So we've got it at the top here and the

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,300
bottom, that's absolutely fine, but we're going to have to put in some loop cuts,

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,300
in order to make this work properly. So let's go ahead

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,300
and do that now! Control and

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,300
R, there we go we've got a loop! And I'm just using the

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Scroll Wheel here to add our level of detail. Now, I'm guessing it's going

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
to need to be about, this is going to be 1,

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,300
2, 3, 4, 5,

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,300
and then, this one here. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so that

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,300
is perfect! Then, once we've positioned them, I'll position the first one

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,300
here. Now, I'm going to leave

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,300
this flat, right at the very bottom, so that all of the pieces

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,300
have a really nice flat bottom. And now, we can

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,300
select the loop edges that run

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,300
around, and we can just make sure, by disappearing from that view, that we've

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,300
selected the loop edge all around and just go back to

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,300
our Front View, so we can model it. And first of all, I'm just going to

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,300
move some of these edges into a more appropriate place. So that one's

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,300
fine. Let's select that one and move it up

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
slightly. Let's go and select this one and move it up,

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,933
so it's in the middle of there.

29
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,199
So we're moving these edge loops,

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
so they're in line with our reference material

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
there, and then, we're going to grab these edge loops and

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
scale them accordingly. So in the 3D realm, obviously we're looking

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
from this front on, but on the 3D we'll be shrinking and pulling that

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,966
in and out. So

35
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,532
this one here, we can lift up much higher,

36
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:13,533
and this one here is going to be right on the edge, where that little lump

37
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:17,533
is around here. So that's fine, as far as that goes, but this

38
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:21,533
still is just a cylinder, at the moment. So let's go ahead and

39
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:25,533
go to Solid Mode here and just make our Background

40
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:29,533
Image a little bit dimmer, so we can work with it.

41
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:33,533
Alright, so let's grab this one here

42
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:37,533
and scale it just inwards,

43
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,533
until it's roughly in the right place.

44
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:45,533
Perfect! And let's do the same to this one here, let's scale

45
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:49,533
that inwards, grab this one and

46
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:53,533
scale... Ooh, let's make sure we grab the whole edge loop

47
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:57,533
and scale that inwards. You see what I'm doing here,

48
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:01,533
I'm just modeling our... Oops, I can't see my keyboard!

49
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:05,533
Be careful which keys you press! That one there, and then, finally

50
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:09,533
this top edge loop here, I can scale that all the way

51
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:13,533
in to the appropriate place, so I've got a rough outline of

52
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:17,533
our model there. So we're going to want to, now,

53
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:21,533
smooth out these edges, and you can do that using the Bevel

54
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:25,533
Tool. So we'll start down at the bottom edge here.

55
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:29,533
So select the edge you want to apply a bevel to,

56
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:33,533
and then, the shortcut keys for it are control and

57
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:37,533
B. That's a nice easy one to remember for Bevel, B for

58
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:41,533
Bevel. And as you move the cursor

59
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:45,533
further away, we start to add that beveled edge in, and you can use the

60
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:49,533
Scroll Wheel to increase the detail level in that bevel.

61
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,533
You can, of course, go too far and force your model to look

62
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,533
very odd. There may be an application for that but I can't think of one,

63
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:01,533
at the moment. And of course, the more detail you put in there, you can start getting silly, that's the

64
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:05,533
amount of segments it's going to make up. Because we're working on the low poly,

65
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:09,533
probably 3 or 4, something like that, then we can just left-click to

66
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,833
apply that.

67
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,833
And in the menu system, because we've selected an edge there,

68
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,833
let's go have a look at the Mesh, Edges

69
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,833
OK, and there we go, Bevel is

70
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,833
at the bottom for me, depending on your resolution. But it looks like it's about

71
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,833
in the middle. So there we go, Bevel is also in the menu selection there, and

72
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,199
we can see the shortcut Control and B.

73
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,166
And finally, we've introduced it a couple of times, but

74
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:41,166
you can just press the Spacebar and then

75
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:45,166
type in what you're looking for. And there we go,

76
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:49,166
Bevel! It's a very powerful, a very quick way of finding things

77
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:53,166
in Blender, if you know what they're called. So remember that, Spacebar and

78
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,066
then you start typing the command you're looking for.

79
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:59,532
OK, so there's one final thing to go over with the Bevel

80
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:03,533
Tool, and that's when you can Bevel an individual vertex. So let's

81
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:07,533
go ahead and open up a default cube, because I don't think there's anywhere on this pawn

82
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:11,533
that we can use that on. OK, so now

83
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:15,533
we're on a default cube! Let's go ahead and go into

84
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:19,533
Edit Mode and select, let's say, this edge here. Now,

85
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:23,533
of course, the edge is made up of two vertices, one at either end.

86
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:27,533
If I go ahead and use Control and B to bevel, we will get what we

87
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:31,533
usually get, and then, if we go into the Operator

88
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:35,533
Panel, in the lower-left, we can see we've got some options, so we can

89
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:39,533
change the Amount of the bevel, the Segments, etc. Or we could have

90
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:43,533
changed those with the Scroll Wheel, as we were creating it.

91
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:47,533
Now, one of the options there is Vertex Only, and if you select that you can

92
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:51,533
see that the vertices themselves are now being beveled, rather than the

93
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:55,533
edge, and that can come in use, depending on what you're modeling. I don't think that's going to be

94
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:59,533
use for it in the chess set, but do prove me wrong and make yourselves

95
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:03,533
some beveled vertices in there, if you wanted to. But what we can

96
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:07,533
do here is also use a shortcut key, so we don't have to go down and check this

97
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,533
box every time. So I'm going to undo the bevel that I've

98
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:15,533
just done and go to Vertex Select. I'm going to select this individual

99
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:19,533
vertex here, in the corner, and hold down Control,

100
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,533
Shift, and B. So it's not just Control B, it's Control, Shift,

101
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,533
and B, and then, we can bevel that edge there. And of course, with the

102
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:31,533
Scroll Wheel we can add more segments, if we wanted to, to smooth

103
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:35,533
that out. And there we go, we've beveled a corner, we've cut

104
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:39,533
a slice through our cube. Now, of course, this has got many uses,

105
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:43,533
in the chess set it might not be but I'm sure you'll find lots of uses

106
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,533
in your own work, as well, and if you do use it to create something funky,

107
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:51,533
of course, share it with us all. So now, it's challenge

108
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,299
time! I'd like you

109
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,900


110
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,900
to finish the base! So using the Bevel Tool to round off

111
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,900
our sharp edges that are left, finish of the detail to the

112
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,900
base, if you feel it needs more. I think it does, towards the top, as it just bulges out

113
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,900
slightly towards the neck of those pieces. And then, of course,

114
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,900
use your artistic license, go wild if you want to, try and be a little bit

115
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,900
sensible because these are official chess pieces, and then finally, remember to

116
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,200
save your file. Pause the video

117
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,800


118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,800
now and give that a go! OK guys,

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,400
welcome back! Let's hop back over into Blender!

120
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,400
OK, so I'm going to start with this big bulgy bit

121
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,400
here and try and smooth that out a little. So let's select the edge

122
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,400
here and edge loop and add

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
ourselves another bevel. Now that's good

124
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,400
what it's done there, because it's a pointy edge, it's beveling on both sides for us.

125
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm liking that!

126
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,400
I'm going to move out and have a look at how it is! In fact, I'm going to hop into

127
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Object Mode, and... Well let's

128
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,400
pull this down a little and set the shading in the Tools menu,

129
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,400
over here, to smooth, just so I get a better impression of

130
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,400
how it looks. I do want that to move in a bit further there,

131
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,400
so I'm going to go straight back into Edit Mode, grab this edge loop

132
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,400
here, and simply scale it in.

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Let's hop back into Object Mode and see how that looks! That seems much

134
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,400
better, but this whole section here does now need lifting up, I

135
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,400
feel just a little. And we can play with this to our hearts' content! So in this

136
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,400
case, I think I made a bit of a mistake there, I should have

137
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,400
brought that in first before making that beveled edge, because it's made it look a bit weird.

138
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Fortunately, I've got enough undos to go back and do that now,

139
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,400
so I'm going to go to here and grab the edge loop, scale

140
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,400
it in. That's great! And in fact, I could even

141
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
add a tiny bit of a bevel inside there, not much,

142
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,400
but just enough to round it off as we go around.

143
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,400
This one here, I'm going to use my artistic license and lift it up a little, so it's a bit

144
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,400
more equidistant here, apply another bevel on this edge,

145
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,400
and let's round it out. Probably

146
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
only that many is necessary around there. Let's flip around, back

147
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,400
to the front again. Oops, I need the cursor on the 3D view to do that,

148
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
and yes, I think we can scale that out! Because it's all selected,

149
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,400
you can grab it and straight away scale it out, just push it out ever so

150
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,400
slightly. Brilliant! So I'm happy with those bits there, so it's just this

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,400
bit towards the top. So let's just bring the Opacity up.

152
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,400
You can see on this image that there's kind of like another bulge

153
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,400
ring that runs around here, until it goes into the neck,

154
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,400
so I'm just going to use a couple of the tools we've done already, in order

155
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
to do that. So first of all, I feel like

156
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I probably need to inset this top face just a little. So

157
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm going to select the face and inset ever so slightly, not by

158
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,400
much and there we go! And we're going to need a a couple bits more of

159
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,400
detail around here, because it kind of bulges out. So we're going to go back

160
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,400
into Edge Mode

161
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,400
and put in an edge loop or two

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,400
around here. Now, I've simply, once I've placed those

163
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,400
about there I think, we can hop into Face

164
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Select, and I'm going to select this face ring going around

165
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,400
and scale that out, ever so slightly.

166
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,400
I think that's going to have the desired result

167
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I'm going for. Let's just have a look here and see!

168
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Now, there's a bit of a sharp edge there, I can

169
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,400
pull that down to rectify that, so let's hop back into Edit Mode.

170
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,400
So moving backwards and forwards between them and checking your model out is a

171
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,400
great way of making sure that your model is exactly how you like it.

172
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Hop in and out and in and out. I'm just going to set that back to Smooth Shading.

173
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,400
In fact, I think that comes out a bit too far,

174
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,400
I didn't want it quite that large. So again, back in ever so slightly!

175
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,400
We've got the hump there, I do feel like that needs to come down ever so slightly,

176
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,400
so I'll select this top one here and pull that down,

177
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,400
as well. So we've got this lump coming up and I'm going to pull that one down,

178
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,400
and you can do this and tweak it till your heart's content, but I think

179
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm going to leave it there, as I believe I've reached my

180
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,400
80/20 principle going on there. So I'm happy with

181
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,400
that as my standard base, that we're going to use across all of our models now,

182
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,400
and remember, at the end, we do need to save it. So we've saved

183
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,400
our chess piece base! Brilliant! I will see you in the next

184
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,366
lecture!
