00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Planning our Project! So in this video

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we're going to check out the design specs of a chess board, make sure we get

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
some descent reference material in there. We're going to design our chess board using

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that information, and from that, we're going to design

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
our working scale so we've got our scale right,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
across all of the pieces and the board, etc. Now finally, we're going to play

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,600
about in Blender, to get it feeling right.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,900
OK guys, straight away a challenge for you!

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,900
I'd like you to go and plan the project yourself, see how you get on with it!

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,900
So go off and research chess sets, see if you can get a feeling,

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,900
there's some good information out there! Look for, particularly,

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,900
the piece dimension and size, that's going to be important, then,

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,033
think about the set as a whole.

14
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,633
It took me about

15
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:53,633
10 to 15 minutes to go through all the research materials and just

16
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:57,633
play about and think about the actual set as a whole.

17
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:01,633
So pause the video now, go off and spend a couple of minutes doing

18
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:05,633
the research and looking at dimensions and sizes, and come up with

19
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:09,633
your own strategy for this project. What size are the pieces

20
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:13,633
going to be in Blender? What scale are you modeling to? OK, pause the video

21
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:17,200
now, and I will see you in a few moments!

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Hello and welcome back! How did you get on?

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
So first of all, let's look at the king's dimensions!

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
So through the research, I've seen that the height of the king

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,733
is about 9.5 centimeters.

26
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:34,966
The king's base is somewhere

27
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:38,966
between 40 and 50% of the height, and the diameter

28
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,966
of the base will therefore, calculated, will be somewhere between

29
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:46,966
3.8 and 4.75 centimeters. The

30
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:50,966
chess board square dimension. Now, there's a few

31
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,966
sources out there, but I found out that the king's base is going to be approximately

32
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:58,966
75% of the square. The square is about two

33
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:02,966
times the diameter of the pawn's base, and a square is typically

34
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:06,966
somewhere between 5 and 6 1/2 centimeters across.

35
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:10,966
So we can then calculate the a pawn's base is going to

36
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:14,966
be somewhere between 2.5 and 3.25 centimeters.

37
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:18,966
So taking all of that into account, what I've done

38
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:22,966
is I've come up with these chosen dimensions, nice numbers there, and

39
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:26,966
just to show you how they visually fit in my mind as well. So the chosen

40
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:30,966
dimensions, we can see that the King's position

41
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:34,966
and size is about 4.5

42
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,666
centimeters across,

43
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,933
which is 75%

44
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:42,933
of 6 centimeters which is our chosen square size. Nice large numbers

45
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:46,933
there! And going on the other side, I've decided that the

46
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,933
Pawn will be 3 centimeters, which also fits into our 6 centimeters

47
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:54,933
and also has that nice whole number there. And finally, the other's position

48
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:58,933
and size, well it's not going to be as large as the King or as small as the Pawn, so I've thought

49
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:02,933
4 centimeters would be perfect for that. So there

50
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,933
we go! We just need to hop into Blender now and just do a scale test,

51
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:10,933
to make sure that we're going to be working in the right scale in Blender itself.

52
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:15,633
So in our wonderful default Blender file,

53
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,633
I'm just going to Delete our cube there. Alright, we've got

54
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,633
a 6 centimeter square and there's going to be

55
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:27,633
8 of them. So I'm just looking at the scale of the board itself, at the moment.

56
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:31,633
So I'm just going to quickly create us a Plane. It just

57
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:35,633
has to be a flat plane there. Brilliant! And 6 times

58
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,633
8 is 48, so it's going to have a Radius of

59
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,633
half of that, which is 24.

60
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:47,633
Let's see how that looks! Alright, that's pretty big!

61
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:51,633
I'm going to keep it like that, for the moment, because I do like the whole numbers.

62
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:55,633
I don't really want to start dealing with decimals, just at this moment.

63
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:59,633
We can always scale later on. Let's just save that!

64
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:03,633
Save and I'm going to save

65
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:07,633
it as Chessboard. Excellent! And

66
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:11,633
I'm just going to add a tiny bit of detail to this, so please excuse me

67
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:15,633
while I hop into Edit Mode, Subdivide this a couple

68
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:19,633
of times. So we've just got our grid there, hop

69
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:23,633
out of Edit Mode, and Save it. Brilliant! I'm now going to

70
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,633
create another new Blender file. I could make it in here. I should,

71
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:31,633
let's just make it in here! So in Edit Mode, I'm just going to

72
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:35,633
find myself... There will do, roughly,

73
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:39,633
and that'll be on there. Yes it is! Perfect! And just create a

74
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:43,633
Cylinder, which is going to represent our

75
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:47,633
king. Let's do the largest piece on there. So it's going

76
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:51,633
to have a Radius. Since we're stuck to a centimeter being a Blender unit, that's

77
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,633
nice and straight forward. It's 4.5, so

78
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:59,633
2.25 on the Radius, so there we go there! And

79
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,633
the height is going to be, so Depth here will be 9.5,

80
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,633
which represents 9.5, and we can see it's gone around

81
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,633
the axis there. So in the Transform, just up here,

82
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:15,633
I'm going to set the Z height

83
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,633
to be 4.75,

84
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:23,633
I think. There we go! So we've got

85
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:27,633
our... That's what it will look like, roughly, here! Now, I do

86
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:31,633
like the fact that this is going to be a bit big. I'm not

87
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:35,633
happy with it being massively larger than the stage there. It's still within our 100

88
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:39,633
Blender unit limit, that we should stick to, but they are

89
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:43,633
whole numbers and that is quite important, especially when teaching you guys

90
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:47,633
because I tend to get numbers wrong, occasionally, as the previous

91
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:51,633
section showed. So we're going to stick to whole numbers here.

92
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:55,633
I mean, I'd like it half the size of this, you see we're already in the 10th but there's lots of 0.0's,

93
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:59,633
0.25's, and all that going on, so I'm going to avoid that for the moment

94
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,633
and build it at this scale. I'm happy that it's not going to be too big, and it'll also

95
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:07,633
be representative of what we're working with. So there we go, we've hopped into

96
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,633
Blender and basically mocked up a chess board, really quickly,

97
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:15,133
just to see how things would sit on it.

98
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,400
So there we go, and I will see you in the next lecture!
