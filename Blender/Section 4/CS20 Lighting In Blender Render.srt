1
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:04,966
Welcome to Lighting in Blender! So in this video we're going to

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:08,966
understand that the lamps themselves mainly apply to Blender

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:12,966
Render, not the Cycles Engine. In fact, light is

4
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:16,966
handled differently in Cycles, amongst other things.

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:20,966
We're going to be adjusting lamps properties and seeing its

6
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:24,966
affect. We will switch into rendered mode in the Viewport

7
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:28,966
Shading Options, to see what is actually happening, as well.

8
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:34,133
Now before we hop over into Blender, let's look at the different lamp

9
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:38,133
options. So we've got a nice table here with the type of lamp

10
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:42,133
on the left, moving across to its description, and a real world example.

11
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:46,133
So we have a point lamp, which is an Omni-

12
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:50,133
directional Point light source. So the light comes out of it evenly in

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,133
every direction, much like a traditional light bulb you'd

14
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:58,133
have at home. Now, a Spotlight is a directional

15
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:02,133
Point light source, so it's very similar to the Point source, only it has direction

16
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:06,133
to it. So if you imagine, like a Spotlight, or perhaps when you

17
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:10,133
put a lampshade over the top of a normal bulb, it

18
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:14,133
makes it into a directional light. Now, an Area

19
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:18,133
lamp simulates an area that's producing

20
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:22,133
light, so like an open window or a TV,

21
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:26,133
laptop screen, something along those lines. Now, Hemi is the odd one out

22
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:30,133
here, it doesn't produce any shadows, it's a soft and far away light source.

23
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:34,133
It's much like the sky is on a cloudy day, without any direct sunlight,

24
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:38,133
you'll notice that shadows are far and few between outside, when that happens.

25
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:42,133
And finally, the Sun, well no guesses there, it simulates the

26
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:46,133
Sun, a far away but still direct light.

27
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,166
Example, the Sun!

28
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,300
This, of course, is like a Spotlight

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,300
in many ways, because it has a direction to it, so it

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,300
casts a shadow, but it will light up the entire scene evenly.

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,300
OK, let's hop straight on over into Blender!

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,333
Alright,

33
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:07,966
so we're in Blender here, and let's just work out our workspace!

34
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:11,966
Now, I've opened up a new Blender file. If you haven't done this yet,

35
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,966
please save the stuff you're working on and open up a new

36
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:19,966
Blender file. So I'm just going to organize my workspace here and just remove

37
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:23,966
the bits that I don't need, so I'm going to get rid of the Timeline at the bottom. I'm going to

38
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:27,966
pull out these two windows here, because we're going to use both

39
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:31,966
of those, in a moment. I'm just going to make the Outliner a little larger.

40
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:35,966
OK, so we can see in our scene, and you probably spotted it before, that we have

41
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:39,966
at least a Camera, a Cube, and a Lamp

42
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:43,966
in our scene. Now, all of these are objects, and you can literally grab the transform

43
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:47,966
handles and move them about to your hearts' content or hit G

44
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:51,966
and more around the lamp, as well. Absolutely fine, you can do that with

45
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:55,966
any object that's in our 3D View here. So

46
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:59,966
first of all, let's go and play with the lamps and see what they look like! So in order

47
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:03,966
to do that, what I'd like you to do is select this cube here and move it

48
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:07,966
up, just so it's floating above this surface here.

49
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:11,966
And then, we're going to Add another mesh, which is just a plane

50
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:15,966
and simply scale that up to act as a floor. It doesn't really

51
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:19,966
matter how big it is, in some ways the bigger the better, but there we go!

52
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,966
And now, next to where it says Object Mode, in the 3D

53
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:27,966
Editor, where you can switch it backwards and forwards, we have the

54
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:31,966
Viewport Shading options, and usually, we've been working with Solid,

55
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:35,966
right at the very top of that is Rendered. Now, this

56
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,966
is what it will look like if you have Blender Render selected.

57
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:43,966
If it looks a bit faded out, something like this, you

58
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:47,966
probably have Cycles Render selected. And we will be working,

59
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:51,966
for the rest of this certain section, in Blender Render, so

60
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,966
make sure it's selected at Blender Render, along the Info Header there.

61
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:59,966
Brilliant! So we're in here, how let's play with our

62
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:03,966
lamp! So we have our Lamp here and

63
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:07,966
once it's selected in the Properties Window,

64
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:11,966
we can see along here is the same icon, it's this circle with

65
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:15,966
four arrows coming out of it, and these are our lamp options,

66
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:19,966
essentially. And if we scroll down, there's a Preview there that gives you an idea

67
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:23,966
of what's going on but even better is the Preview we can see right in

68
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:27,966
front of us here! So I'm going to scroll down so we just see

69
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:31,966
Lamp. So, at the moment, it's set to a Point lamp, Omnidirectional light

70
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:35,966
source. So it fills up the scene, but as you can see, it fades away! There's a couple

71
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,966
of ways you control that fade, number one is this starting Energy. And

72
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:43,966
if you turn up the starting Energy, it obviously makes the light really really bright,

73
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:47,700
and obviously, if you turn it all the way down, eventually it will just go black.

74
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,900
And beneath that, we have the Falloff, which

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,900
tells Blender how to manage the way that it gets

76
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,900
dark, how quickly the light falls off, essentially, and you can change

77
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,900
those about and just see. Constant, Inverse Square is usually

78
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,900
quite good to work with, but you can play to your hearts' content with that!

79
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,900
Alright, so we've got those two options there, and further down,

80
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,900
we can go into Shadow, we can have it cast No Shadow, which is a

81
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,900
bit odd, I do like it casting a shadow because it looks a bit better.

82
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,900
And we have our sampling for our shadow! Now, in general you want

83
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,900
to have that a bit higher than 1, but I don't suggest putting

84
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,900
it too high, otherwise you may slow your computer down to a crawl. If we say it's

85
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,900
100, for instance, you can see how slow that is to get the detail

86
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,900
into our scene... Sorry, I say set to 100,

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,900
you can only set it to 64 maximum! When we set it to something like

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,900
10, it's relatively quick to finish off the rendering of that scene.

89
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,900
Now, the Soft Size, if we increase that

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,900
you probably gathered it makes the shadow, since we're under Shadow, a bit softer,

91
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,900
and eventually, we end up with something that looks a bit better than that harsh

92
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,900
square that we had before. So let's have a look at the

93
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,900
other Lamp types that we've got! So Sun will also cast a shadow,

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,900
but as you can see, the rest of the scene is unformly lit,

95
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,900
apart from... Whoah, if we move around you can see that some

96
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,900
sides of the cube are darker than others, and in fact,

97
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,900
some of them are black. So this is something that you have to get used to with Blender

98
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Render, is that if a surface is not being hit by any light

99
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,900
at all, it just turns black, there's no detial in there whatsoever.

100
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,900
OK, let's zoom out and move around and turn on the

101
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Spotlight! So here we have our Spotlight, not highlighting

102
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,900
our cube very well at all. And if you were setting up a scene like this,

103
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,900
you could hop back into Solid Mode here and actually see the cone

104
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,900
itself. We can see here that our spotlight

105
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,900
is basically not highlighting our cube, at the moment, and if I do

106
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,900
that, the good chance is that it's now doing that. Popping back into

107
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Rendered Mode and there we go, our cube is now being hit with that Spotlight, and

108
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,900
you can see very quickly the rest of the scene that isn't in our Spotlight

109
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,900
goes black. And you can control that, as you scroll down you can

110
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,900
actually change the Spot Shape, so that's underneath the Shadow Options

111
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,900
we were playing with a moment ago. The Spot Shape, you can increase the

112
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,900
degrees that that light is or even narrow it down, if you want

113
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,900
to. Now, we've got the Blend, which detects

114
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,900
how smooth the blend between light and dark is. You can have a

115
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,900
square Spotlight, if you like, and this one, I really love this,

116
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,900
the Halo, it produces that wonderful thing there. Intensity 1

117
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,900
is too much, but if we turn that down a little, a little

118
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,900
more, probably even 0.178, that's brilliant! So that's almost like a window

119
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,900
opening or something like that. I do like that effect that it does there! Now,

120
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,900
this beam here can end up being quite short, and that's all to do with this

121
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Distance here, under Falloff. So if we turn

122
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,900
that down, you can see that you can end up with it looking a bit like that, at times, which

123
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,900
just looks a bit odd. If that does happen, you just turn up the Distance to a certain

124
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,333
amount, and there we go, the cone is

125
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:13,133
all the way to this surface that it's hitting. Now, Hemi, as I said, that's one of

126
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:17,133
these odd ones. I'm just going to turn the Energy down just a little.

127
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:21,133
In fact, I'm just going to type in 1 and set it back to default. Now, here we go,

128
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,133
we can see all around our object. This is one of the ones that

129
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:29,133
doesn't cast a shadow but also means that the sides that are not

130
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:33,133
being affected by the light, because Hemi is still directional,

131
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:37,133
and if we pop into Object Mode we can see that it has a line

132
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:41,133
coming from it. In fact, the Sun also has a line coming

133
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:45,133
from it, and you can see the icon changes slightly, as well, depending on

134
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:49,133
what we're doing. So it still has a direction to it but it does not cast a shadow, but it

135
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:53,133
illuminates our scene quite evenly. So you can use a mixture of Lamps

136
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,966
in your scene, to emulate the real world.

137
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:59,600
And finally, we have Area, so let's hop back

138
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
into Rendered Mode, on the Viewport Shading, and

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
that's really bright so, in this case, let's play with some of the options. Let's play with

140
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Distance, that looks a bit better! That looks much better! And eventually, you'll

141
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
find a level that works for you. Now, the

142
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
shadow here, it looks a bit horrible, actually, to be quite

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
honest, and that's because we've got Samples in the X direction at

144
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
10 and the Y at 1, I'm guessing. So if we put that at 10 and 10 that's

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,366
a much smoother shadow. So Area, so

146
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:34,733
as the light's coming out, it's not coming from a point anymore, it's emulating a

147
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:38,733
size, and we can scroll down and you can see the Area Shape. So this is where

148
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:42,733
you would tweak, and depending on the size of the window in the room, or something

149
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:46,733
along those lines, you could have a really really wide

150
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:50,733
window in the room, 10 by 10. I presume that's Blender units there!

151
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:54,733
And obviously the shadow ends up being almost nothing, but if you had a

152
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:58,733
tiny window in a room, perhaps 1 by 1, that would be more

153
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:02,733
like a Point light source, because it would be much much smaller.

154
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:06,733
So feel free to play with these options here, as much as you

155
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:10,100
like. It's great fun playing with lights in our scene,

156
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,600
and you can see there effect, in real time, on the window

157
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,600
here. Now, perhaps you want to work with the model and

158
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
the lamp, so you can move them around independently. Sure grab yourself another

159
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,600
window, so you've got a rendering window. I'm just going to move this one in, because I'm working in

160
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,600
quite a low resolution, and I'm going to get rid of my Tool Shelves. So here we

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
have our rendering, and it's just two 3D Windows, and we have our rendering on the

162
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
left and our 3D View on the right here. And the great thing

163
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
about this is, we can move this to our hears' content, and then, on the left-hand

164
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,600
side or wherever you've put it see the differences. So I can change that to Spot

165
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
and then move it, and we can see straight away the real

166
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
time changes that are being made. Brilliant! So I think

167
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
there's a challenge for you guys, coming up!

168
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Setup some lights! So go

169
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,966
ahead and in our chess scene

170
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:06,966
place some lamps to light our scene. Now, it's your choice of how you

171
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,966
want to light it. Play about and experiment! I'll give you a

172
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:14,966
few hints here that I'm probably going to use a Sun Lamp and a

173
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,966
Hemi Lamp, in order to generate a uniform light

174
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:22,966
for our scene. But if you want it to be more dramatic, perhaps play with a couple of Spotlights

175
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:26,966
and cast some long shadows across the board, it's entirely up to you.

176
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:30,033
This is your artistic choice! Have fun,

177
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,533
pause the video now, and give that a go!

178
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:36,533
OK guys, welcome back!

179
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:40,533
Now, let's see how I would light the scene, it may be different to how you've done it,

180
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,166
but let's have fun and see how we get on!

181
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,166
Alright, so let's open up our chess scene!

182
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,166
So Open, low-poly-chess-set, ChessScene. So

183
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:56,166
there we go! So this is how it's looking at the moment, which is brilliant! We've got

184
00:11:56,166 --> 00:12:00,166
our hierarchy all setup here. Excellent! So

185
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:04,166
we've got one lamp in the scene and it's pretty low down. First of all,

186
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:08,166
I'm just going to see how it looks. So let's hop straight down into

187
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,166
Rendered Mode! Ooh, actually, that's kind of dramatic!

188
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:16,166
I kind of like that! But I do want to light up all my pieces, I kind of want to

189
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:20,166
show them off, in this case! And remember, you can always alter

190
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:24,166
your lamps at any point. you're not stuck. In fact, you could

191
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,166
create lots of lamps in your scene and move them about, as if there was an array

192
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:32,166
of lights above you. The choice is yours! So in

193
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,166
this case, however, I will want to have a Sun

194
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,166
Lamp that does the entire scene, absolutely fine.

195
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:44,166
But what it does do, unfortunately, is create these nasty shadows,

196
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:48,166
so I'm going to simply select the Lamp in the Outliner,

197
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:52,166
pop over to the 3D Window and duplicate it. Not

198
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:56,166
Linked Duplicate, that's good if you've got multiple lights and you want to control them all at

199
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:00,166
once, however, if I just do a simple duplicate, we've

200
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:04,166
now got two suns. But what I can do here

201
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:08,166
in... Oops, I'm moving that Lamp, I don't want to do that! We just can't see I'm doing

202
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:12,166
that because I'm in the Rendered Mode. This Lamp here, so we're going to call this one Sun,

203
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,166
and I'm going to call this one Ambient.

204
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:20,166
Excellent! So

205
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:24,166
we've got Sun and an Ambient. Oh, I've named them both

206
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:28,166
the same! That's really cleaver of me there! And I'm going to group

207
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,166
these together into our lighting, so I'm going to create... You

208
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:36,166
don't have to do this yourself, I'm just doing it for my hierarchy.

209
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:40,166
I'm going to create an Empty, it doesn't matter what it is. I'm going

210
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,866
to make it a Sphere,

211
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:45,800
I'm going to call this Lighting, and that just helps group

212
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,800
my lighting all together, as well. So there we go, all in

213
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,666
there at the parent object, and I'm going to correct the spelling

214
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,666
mistake there. There we go! So Lighting and we've got Ambient and Sun, and both of them are Sun at the

215
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,666
moment and we can see that we've got these dark areas. However, on

216
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,666
the Ambient one, when it's selected, I'm going to go to Hemi.

217
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:10,666
Now, it looks like that and we've still got some shadows, but I think the Hemi's a bit, actually,

218
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,666
making the board very very bright, in this case. So I'm going to turn

219
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,666
down the energy that the Hemi has, perhaps even

220
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,666
to let's try 0.3 or there abouts.

221
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:26,666
Yeah, I like that, that's good! Let's go to the

222
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,666
Sun itself and I'm going to split this

223
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,666
window, so I can see what's going on. Now, the Sun

224
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,666
is here in our scene. I don't want it there. If

225
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:42,666
I put it here and just hit rotate, rotate it around,

226
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:46,666
lift it up a little more because it is a sun, after all,

227
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,666
and rotate that down, so you can have lots of fun with this. It's now shining on our

228
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,833
board. Let's rotate around the rendering.

229
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,533
Let's go to View and just

230
00:14:56,533 --> 00:15:00,533
View Selected. There we go, we're zoomed in there!

231
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,533
Yeah, that looks good! I like that lots!

232
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:08,533
Nothing's blown out, we've still got detail over the place. I like

233
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,933
that lots! How did you guys get on? Please share your

234
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
lighting attempt in the discussions! I'd love to see what lighting

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
schemes you came up with yourself! Perhaps some groovy spotlights there

236
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
or a deep dark thing. Remember we do want to show off our pieces

237
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and our board, at the moment, so don't make it too noir on us, too

238
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
dark and contrasty, because we won't be able to see all the effort you guys are putting in.

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
OK, as I said, put those in the discussions and I will see you

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,233
in the next lecture!
