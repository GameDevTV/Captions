00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to Using an Image as a Texture!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video we're going to show you how to add a texture

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to your material. We're going to reinforce the defuse and specular

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
settings, we're going to model the board surround, and then, finally

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
apply a texture to that board surround, making it look much

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
better! So let's hop straight on over into Blender!

7
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.166
So here we are in Blender and with our default cube!

8
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:34.166
So let's zoom into our cube a little high, at the Timeline,

9
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:38.166
and I'm getting a feeling I should just set this as my standard layout,

10
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.166
by now. And let's apply a Material,

11
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:46.166
of course, there's going to be one already applied. I'm going to call

12
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:50.166
it Brickwork, and the next

13
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:54.166
section along on the Properties Pane,

14
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.766
this little checkered square here, that's the texture

15
00:00:56.766 --> 00:01:00.133
properties. So you can click on that there and we've

16
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:04.133
got a list down here. Now, I'm going to name this Bricks,

17
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:08.133
and then, further down

18
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.133
just have a look here.

19
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:14.133
Type, well it needs to be an image, in this case. There's loads of other

20
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:18.133
options, which are procedurally generated textures, but we're going to

21
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:22.133
use, in this case, an Image or Movie. So if we select that

22
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:26.133
and go into your assets pack, and you will

23
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:30.133
find a texture. I

24
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:34.133
can't remember what it's called. I think it's called Bricks? Yes, it's called Bricks.JPG!

25
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:38.133
So open that up and it will give us an example of the

26
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:42.133
texture itself. Well is it applied to here? Well we don't know at the

27
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:46.133
moment, while the Viewport Shading is set to Solid. So change it

28
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:50.133
now to Rendered, and we'll see how it goes!

29
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:54.133
OK, so it has applied it but it does look a bit odd there,

30
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:58.133
as you can see it looks a bit funny down the sides there.

31
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:02.133
So first of all, so we can see our entire object, I'm

32
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:06.133
going to change our lamp to a

33
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:10.133
Hemi just so the whole things' highlighted, and

34
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:14.133
I'm just going to go around our cube. OK, so

35
00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:18.133
this is a good example here, there's

36
00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:22.133
not a chance in the world that a wall is going to look that shiny,

37
00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:26.133
that glossy, unless someone's going around varnishing walls!

38
00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:30.133
So in our Materials properties, for the Cube, if we go

39
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:34.133
down and turn the Specular either all the way down or off...

40
00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:38.133
Yep, I'm happy with that now, and I'm just going to

41
00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:42.133
turn the Diffuse up, in this case! OK, so let's hop back

42
00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:46.133
over into the Texture, scroll

43
00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:50.133
down a little. So what we're looking for here is the Mapping.

44
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:54.133
So at the moment, the coordinates for this

45
00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:58.133
texture are being generated by

46
00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:02.133
Blender for us, which is great, and their projection is flat, which is

47
00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:06.133
why we've got these lovely stripes down the side of our

48
00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:10.133
block work. We may want that but, in this case, I certainly

49
00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:14.133
do not. So if we change the Projection of that from Flat to

50
00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:18.133
Cube, you'll see that ah there we go!

51
00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:22.133
We've now got our texture applied to all of the

52
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:26.133
sides! As your model gets more and more complicated,

53
00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:30.133
and we will get to UV Mapping and Unwrapping, later

54
00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:34.133
on, but you will need to do that. But since our models

55
00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:38.133
are quite simple, at the moment, with basic textures, this brickwork

56
00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:42.133
here, for instance, is working really well. The

57
00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:46.133
other one you can choose here is Object, so we're mapping it to the

58
00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:50.133
Object itself, and that does look a bit bizarre, at the moment. And why is

59
00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:54.133
that? Well that looks very bizarre, it's kind of tracking our view, at the moment,

60
00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:58.133
because we've not selected an object for it to be mapped to.

61
00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:02.133
And if we select the Cube as the mapping, there we go

62
00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:06.133
it's mapped in a very similar manner, as it was before. There are

63
00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:10.133
quite a few other options in the Coordinates, we

64
00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:14.133
won't be using any of these, at the moment. OK,

65
00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:18.133
so finally, the Size and Offset. Well Offset,

66
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:22.133
as you could probably guess, shifts the texture from left to

67
00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:26.133
right, up and down, etc. And the Size, well this

68
00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:30.133
acts in the reverse manner, as I was expecting it to.

69
00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:34.133
So if I half the values of X and Y, the texture

70
00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:38.133
actually gets larger, as we can see there, and if I

71
00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:42.133
double the value of X and Y, the texture gets

72
00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:46.133
half the size. So it's very easy to get confused which

73
00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:50.133
way around those things are, I certainly did. I'm going to set them back to 1, for the moment.

74
00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:51.833
And you may

75
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.833
need to alter this depending on the scale of the model that you're working

76
00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:59.833
on. In this case, that looks absolutely fine,

77
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:03.066
and I'm happy with that!

78
00:05:03.066 --> 00:05:07.066
So I've just saved that Brick Cube,

79
00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:11.066
for the moment, just in case I need it again in future, and

80
00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:15.066
I'm going to go and open up my ChessScene! So

81
00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:19.066
let's go and model the surround to the board itself!

82
00:05:19.066 --> 00:05:23.066
So the first thing I'm going to do is Add a Plane

83
00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:27.066
object. OK, that's added it in a funny

84
00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:31.066
location! I've got a couple of options here, I can go to the Transform

85
00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:35.066
up here and relocate it at 0, 0, 0. I could go

86
00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:39.066
over here to the Add Plane, in the Operator Panel,

87
00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:43.066
and change that to 0, 0, 0. In this case, I'm going to choose to just

88
00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:47.066
undo the creation of that and use Shift and

89
00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:51.066
C, to both center the view and put the 3D Cursor

90
00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:55.066
bang in the middle of our scene. Then, I can create our

91
00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:59.066
Mesh, Plane. I think this is a 24

92
00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:03.066
Radius? I'm not sure, let's just give it a quick go to 24.

93
00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:07.066
Excellent! Alright, we're going to use a little bit of a hack

94
00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:11.066
here to get this done. We're going to extrude...

95
00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:15.066
Ooh, we're going to go into Edit Mode first, before we extrude,

96
00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:19.066
and we're going to grab the edge loop, running around the outside

97
00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:23.066
of this plane and we're going to extrude

98
00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:27.066
by absolutely nothing. Odd, I

99
00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:31.066
may say, but this

100
00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:35.066
basically has duplicated that edge, so now we can scale it

101
00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:39.066
outwards. I must say, at this point, if you do have the

102
00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:43.066
Automatically Merge Vertices turned on, on the 3D Editor

103
00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:47.066
Header, that will not work with the process we've just done, because

104
00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:51.066
it'll just merge the 4 vertices at the corners back

105
00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:55.066
into 4, rather than having the 8. So if that is on, you'll turn it off,

106
00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:59.066
and then, we can scale that outwards. And I'm going to

107
00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:03.066
do this by eye. One of those two is absolutely fine,

108
00:07:03.066 --> 00:07:07.066
1.2, 1.3. Brilliant! So I'm going to go

109
00:07:07.066 --> 00:07:11.066
into Face Select and remove this center face completely,

110
00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:15.066
and remember, when you're deleting, in this case, we're

111
00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:19.066
deleting faces. And this middle one now, I can

112
00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:23.066
extrude in the Z axis by -1.

113
00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:31.066
OK, that doesn't appear to have behaved itself.

114
00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:35.066
that's OK, because the Operator Panel still has

115
00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:39.066
Transform in it that we've just done, and apparently I moved it in the X axis.

116
00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:43.066
I'm going to set that to 0 and that to -1, and that should...

117
00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:47.066
Excellent, we don't have the hashing on the top of the board, and we should find it's

118
00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:51.066
got some depth now. Brilliant! OK, so finally,

119
00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:55.066
here I'm going to grab the edge loop running around our board,

120
00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:59.066
I'm going to extrude in the Z axis, yep,

121
00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:03.066
by -2. Excellent, so

122
00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:07.066
it's got some thickness! I'm probably going to undo that

123
00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:11.066
and extrude in the Z axis by -3,

124
00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:15.066
to give it a bit more depth. Then finally, fill in that

125
00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:19.066
face. Excellent! So because we've been going in the negative

126
00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:23.066
direction, quite a bit, I can see straight away that a lot of the

127
00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:27.066
faces we've generated have got the normals around the wrong way. So whilst we're still

128
00:08:27.066 --> 00:08:31.066
in Edit Mode, let's select our entire model, and just flip the

129
00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:35.066
normals around the right way, with Control and N. And whilst we're

130
00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:39.066
here, let's just make sure we've not got any duplicate vertices,

131
00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:43.066
by Removing Doubles. We haven't, in this case,

132
00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:47.066
it's removed 0. Excellent work! So we've got our board

133
00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:51.066
ready to do there, and what we can do finally, I'm

134
00:08:51.066 --> 00:08:55.066
just going to bevel this edge. So I'm going to select the edge loop going around,

135
00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:59.066
hold down Control and B, and add in

136
00:08:59.066 --> 00:09:03.066
a bevel with 3 or so

137
00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:07.066
edges, and let's just have a look at the Operator Panel and see what the other

138
00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:11.066
options we have are. I'm going to set that to a whole number.

139
00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:15.066
That's Segments, yep that's fine! Vertex Only, that's

140
00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:19.066
interesting but not what I want. Let's just work

141
00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:23.066
our way around here, have a look at the profile. Yes, that's a nice

142
00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:27.066
profile. Bear in mind, you can go a bit whacky on your, pop feet on it,

143
00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:31.066
or whatever you want in that way. Clamp Overlap.

144
00:09:31.066 --> 00:09:35.066
OK, that's a bit better

145
00:09:35.066 --> 00:09:39.066
there, that centralizes it a little.

146
00:09:39.066 --> 00:09:43.066
Ah I see, so that prevents it coming too close to the edge. Brilliant, that's

147
00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:47.066
exactly what I want in this case! Ooh, that's interesting

148
00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:51.066
going like that, rather than the other way. I think I'm going to keep that!

149
00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:55.066
Excellent! Alright, so let's just apply that,

150
00:09:55.066 --> 00:09:59.066
sorted, and now, I think it's

151
00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:01.000
time for a challenge!

152
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.700
OK guys, it's challenge time! I'd like you to add a

153
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.700
wooden texture! So using the Brazilian_Rosewood

154
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.566
texture, in your asset pack, apply that to the board surround.

155
00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:14.933
Pause the video now and give that a go!

156
00:10:14.933 --> 00:10:18.933
OK guys, welcome back!

157
00:10:18.933 --> 00:10:22.933
Let's go and apply the Brazilian_Rosewood texture to our board surround.

158
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.500
OK, so we're back in Blender

159
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.500
now! Let's go ahead and add a texture to our

160
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.500
board surround. So first of all, I'm going to go to where it's

161
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.500
it says plane and change the name of this to board surround.

162
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.500
In fact, I'm going to put the word Chess in front of it,

163
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.500
and that's purely so it lines up with the one that's

164
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.500
just Chess Board. So the Chess Board Surround I'm going to add

165
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.500
a Material to it, and I'm going to call it

166
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.500
Chess Board Surround. That'd be a good name for it, so I'm just going to

167
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.500
copy and paste in that name.

168
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.500
Then, I'm going to go straight over to the Textures,

169
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.500
create a new texture, scroll

170
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.500
down a little more. I'm going to make this window bigger now.

171
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.500
Open up Section Assets,

172
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.500
Brazilian_Rosewood. That looks good, I'm going to turn

173
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.500
on Rendered, straight away, and see what it looks like.

174
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.500
Why aren't we seeing anyting? We've got the lighting hidden, so I'm going to

175
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.500
hold down Control and turn both the lights on, at once.

176
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.500
Excellent! So we've got a couple of options here. That

177
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.500
looks like a proper machined bit, because you would

178
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.500
probably, I think the term is metered, to get that 45

179
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.500
degree angle in there with the wood. Let's see

180
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.500
if there's any other options that would suit a bit of experimentation, as

181
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.500
always, never goes amiss. So the Mapping, at the moment, is mapped to UV

182
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.500
Coordinates, and we can see there, it's following the face that

183
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.500
has been generated from there. So if we go to Generated itself...

184
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.500
I'm not too sure on that, the texture it looks very

185
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.500
big, it makes the board

186
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.500
look very small compared to the textures there. So if we went in here and did

187
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.500
X, Y, and I will do Z, as well.

188
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.500
Yeah, that looks OK, as well. That's got

189
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.500
a grain in it. It does look a bit odd though, it does look uniform,

190
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.500
but I do prefer the UV option

191
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.500
that was coming up before. Let's just try Object and set it

192
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.500
to the Chess Board Surround. Wow, that's

193
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.500
certainly too small there! So let's change that

194
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.500
to 0.50, I think. No, it's going to

195
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.500
have to be more than that. So I'm going to leave that, as is

196
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.500
previous selection at UV, because that looks really

197
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.500
nice. Now, the specularity of this, is that about right?

198
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.500
Well, we've got to make a decision here. I don't think wood

199
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.500
would be that polished, so I do want some

200
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.500
specularity but I don't want that much, so I'm just going to turn that down,

201
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.500
until I'm happy with it. I'm going to half it, first of all,

202
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.500
and probably a little lower than that. Yes,

203
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.500
I'm happy with it having some glare on it, some

204
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.500
reflection of the lights in the environment

205
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.500
but not so much that it's too glaring. Alright

206
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.500
brilliant! How did you guys get on? Please share your results in the

207
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.400
discussions, and I will see you in the next lecture!
