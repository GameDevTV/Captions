00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,733
Welcome to Parent

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:05,733
and Child Objects! In this video we're going to see how parents

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:09,733
can group together objects, essentially they become their children.

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:13,733
We're going to create a hierarchy, which is easy to navigate,

5
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:17,733
we'll be using this to logically group our pieces together. Now,

6
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:21,733
when we're doing parents and children, the children can have children,

7
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:25,733
and those children can have children, as well. So you can have a whole family there, so parent, child,

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:29,733
grandchild, and great grandchild, etc.! So looking at

9
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:33,733
our hierarchy, now going from left to right, this is roughly how the Outliner

10
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,733
will be looking. Where we have the chess scene itself,

11
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,733
there will be a Light, some Objects in our scene, and a Camera and a couple of other things,

12
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,733
as well. Now, at the moment, we've already got an Empty in

13
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:49,733
our scene, which is the White Pieces, and under that, we're going to put the

14
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,733
Pawns, the Rooks, the Knights, the Bishops, the King, and Queen, etc. And

15
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:57,733
looking at the number of other objects we have in our scene,

16
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:01,733
it might be worthwhile, we'll see in the Outliner, and

17
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:05,733
looking at the numbers there it worthwhile actually putting the Pawns in their

18
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,733
own little Empty, as well, just so we can have good control

19
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:13,733
over all of those bits and bumps. But we'll see how that looks in the

20
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,733
Outliner, when we start working with it. So talking about the Outliner, let's pop

21
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:20,566
over into Blender!

22
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:23,700
OK, so over in Blender we just

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
need to, I think well the first thing I'm going to do is just tidy up our view. So I'm just

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
going to hide the Timeline at the bottom, since we're not using it, I'm going to

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
hide the Tool Shelf, and hide the Properties Pane on the 3D Editor.

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,700
And I'm just going to move this section across, because we're mainly going to be dealing with the

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Outliner, in this case. Now, I'm going to leave the 3D View here, because

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,700
when we select our individual meshes we can see what's going on.

29
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,700
OK, so the first thing we need to do here is start

30
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,700
grouping these items together. And we can see here we have our scene.

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Inside the scene there are a load of options, we've got at least one mesh object and,

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,700
as a matter of fact, we've got several mesh objects, which is why we're doing this organization.

33
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,700
We've got the camera, we've got the lamp, as well. These can all be

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,700
parented or childed, if you wanted to. So I think with all

35
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,700
of this in the hierarchy already, it might be a good idea to

36
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,700
group even our small pieces together. So the first

37
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
thing I'm going to do

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,133
is how to assign a parent object

39
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,133
to its children. So we'll start with the bishops here, because we've only got two

40
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:31,133
of them, so it won't be a repetitive task anyway, but at the moment,

41
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:35,133
they're just by themselves in our hierarchy.

42
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:39,133
So I'm going to give them an empty, first of all, so I'm going to go

43
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:43,133
Add, Empty, and again just Plain

44
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:47,133
Axes is absolutely fine. I'm going to call this

45
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:51,133
empty, White Bishops.

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,566
So the way that a parent is

47
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:58,566
done is, you select in the order,

48
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:02,566
or rather the last thing that you select will become the parent.

49
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:06,566
After all three items are selected, ending with the thing

50
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:10,566
we want to be the parent, we can go down to Object

51
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:14,566
and scroll up to where it says Parent, and just go

52
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:18,566
to Object, and we can see here, Control and P is the shortcut.

53
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,566
And then, it will say Set Parent To, and we just want

54
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:26,566
Object here. So now that we've done that, we can see that White Bishops

55
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:30,566
has two meshes associated, looking at the Outliner,

56
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:34,566
and when we drop that down, we can see our Bishops beneath. Now, what you will

57
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:38,566
notice, and was a bit counter intuitive when I started using Blender,

58
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:42,566
was when you click White Bishops, it only

59
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:46,566
selects our empty here, it does not select the

60
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:50,566
meshes beneath. If you want to select everything beneath, depending on what you

61
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:54,566
want to do, say we wanted to hide both of the White Bishops without selecting

62
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:58,566
them all, we could Control and click on

63
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:02,566
our empty and that would select everything. Then, if we click the little eye or

64
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:06,566
pressed H, we could hide all of those by

65
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:10,566
clicking Control. You have to have Control down, when you click.

66
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:14,566
So to select them all, we can select them all in the Outliner by holding down Control.

67
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:18,566
To hide them all, we'd have to do that same, and that similar operation applies

68
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,566
to everything else. Finally, we can nest

69
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:26,566
this inside WhitePieces. So we

70
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:30,566
select our first object, or rather in this well

71
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:34,566
it is an object, we select our first object, and then, we select our second object

72
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,566
while holding down Shift, so both are selected. And then, go to Object,

73
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:42,566
Parent, on to Object, and again, Control and P.

74
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:46,566
So in this window here you could just go Control and P, and Set Parent

75
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:50,566
To, Object. Now, under WhitePieces we have

76
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:54,566
White Bishops, and under that, we have Low Poly

77
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:58,566
Bishop one and two. In fact, I might name them

78
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:02,566
1 and 2 now, just for neatness.

79
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:06,566
OK guys, it's challenge time! I'd like you to finish off the organization

80
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:10,566
of the hierarchy! So assign the pawns a parent

81
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:14,566
empty, called White Pawns, and then, make the

82
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:18,566
White Pawns' empty a child of White Pieces.

83
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:22,566
Pause the video now, and go give that a go!

84
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:26,566
OK guys, welcome back! Let's hop straight on over into

85
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:27,666
Blender!

86
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,666
Alright, so we're almost here with these pawns! So the first

87
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,666
thing we need to do is create our empty, that we're going to assign

88
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,666
as the parent to all of these pawns. So Add,

89
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,666
Empty, Plain Axes. I'm going to call

90
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:47,666
this White Pawns, P a w n s. Excellent!

91
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,666
I'm going to select all of these, holding down Shift

92
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,666
as we go, with the final one being White Pawns,

93
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,666
and I'm going to go over here, the cursor has to be in the 3D window. Go Control and

94
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,666
P, set them to the Object. Excellent! So that's tidied up

95
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,666
our hierarchy now, and then, finally, I'm going to select White Pawns, it's

96
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,666
already selected, and put them under White Pieces. Again, Control and P

97
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,666
and set to the Object. And now,

98
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,666
we've got a much neater hierarchy! As you can see, there are now

99
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:23,666
WhitePieces and the Chess Board! Excellent! And when we

100
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,666
open up that, we have our White Bishops and White Pawn!

101
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,666
Ooh, it looks like we have a series of objects selected! So I've made a mistake

102
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,666
there, so let's reassign these,

103
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,666
the parent object of White Pawns. I forgot to

104
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,666
deselect before going forward. And that's excellent, that's popped

105
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:47,666
all of those under there! So WhitePieces, White Bishops, we've got two meshes under there.

106
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,666
White Pawns, we should have eight meshes, which we do, and if you wanted

107
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,666
to, you could go through here and name these appropriately, if you wanted

108
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,666
to. And to keep that naming convention going, without doing too much work, the first

109
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:03,666
one would just be called 0 to 7. Excellent! How did

110
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,666
you guys get on? See you in the next lecture!
