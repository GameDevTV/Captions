00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to Empties in Blender! In this video we'll be

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
introducing the concept of an empty. Essentially, an

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
empty is a null object that has no geometry.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They can be used as a handle to control other objects,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
used as a parent object for a group of

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
objects, and we'll be dealing with that shortly. They also have many other

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
uses that we won't dive into, right at this moment, but will when we need them

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.966
in the course. So let's hop over into Blender!

9
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.366
So let's open up a new file in Blender,

10
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.366
and we get the default cube in the scene . Now, I'm just going to get rid of that, because

11
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:42.366
I'm not going to use that at all, and let's create our first

12
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:46.366
empty. So you add an empty much like you would do

13
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:50.366
a mesh object, so you can use the Add Menu on the 3D Editor Header

14
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:54.366
or just go Shift and A. And well, that's

15
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:58.366
fortunate, my mouse was directly over it! So an Empty, and you can see there are eight

16
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:02.366
different types of empty. Now essentially, they all do a very

17
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.366
similar thing, but depending on the application that you are doing, you may want a different

18
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:10.366
shape or a different type of empty, just so it's more descriptive of

19
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:14.366
the type of control you're going to have. So for

20
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:18.366
instance, if you wanted Single Arrow, if it was a directional

21
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:22.366
control you were using, you can see here that this single arrow is

22
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:26.366
great! And we can scale it up, rotate it around, and we can say the

23
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:30.366
object is pointing that way. And then, when we move the arrow around,

24
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:34.366
we can control an object based upon its direction, very very

25
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:38.366
powerful. So there are lots of different options for your empty, but

26
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:42.366
essentially you go into the Add Menu and go ahead and

27
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:46.366
add an Empty. Now, you cannot create any geometry

28
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:50.366
from that, there's no editing them in that sense,

29
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:54.366
but you can use them later on to control lots of different things

30
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.433
and we'll be doing that very soon with our chess set.

31
00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:01.433
Alright, so in the spirit of keeping it lean, we need to do some

32
00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:05.433
things now! We need to append the bishop into our chess scene to see what it looks like, as

33
00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:09.433
a whole. Check everything is in the right proportion,

34
00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:13.433
and then, start filling up our board. We're going to create the white

35
00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:17.433
pawns. Link duplicate our bishops and pawns. That's important,

36
00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:21.433
rather than just duplicating, because we want it to apply across

37
00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:25.433
any changes we make, we want them to apply across the bishops

38
00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:29.433
that we made and the pawn, so we don't have to repeat ourselves. And then, we'll get on

39
00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:32.433
to managing our models in this scene!

40
00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.400
Let's hop over into Blender!

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Alright, so we're done with this, for the moment! Let's go

42
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and open up our chess scene! So it should be in my recents.

43
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Yep, Chess Scene! And this is where we left it before,

44
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
so go ahead and open up your Chess Scene.blend now, where we brought

45
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
our primary white pawn in. Alright, let's go and

46
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
append our bishop. So we're going to go File,

47
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Append, and go find your Low

48
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Poly Bishop, and in Object, we want to select the

49
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Low Poly Bishop. There we go, that's in our scene! Let's

50
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
just move that about. I'm going to constrain it to the X, Y axis, so it doesn't disappear

51
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
through the floor, by holding down Shift and Z. I'm just going to pop

52
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
it next to our pawn, zoom in a little, and have a look at it in context.

53
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Excellent! That looks really good! OK,

54
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so now we've got that in there! We need a duplicate of

55
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.533
this, and we need another seven duplicates of our pawn.

56
00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.100
Now, before we go ahead and start

57
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.100
messing around with our pawns and duplicating them lots,

58
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.100
I want to show you a really neat trick! Well it's not really a trick, it's an

59
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.100
operation that will save you a load of time, later on when you're doing

60
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.100
very repetitive tasks where an array modifier

61
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.100
might not be of use to you. So for instance, if we wanted to duplicate

62
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.100
this pawn and it was a linked duplicate, of course, we'd do

63
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.100
Alt and D, and we have our pawn here.

64
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.100
Now, if I just lock that to the X, Y axis and just place it

65
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.100
down there, for instance. If I was more accurate, it would be

66
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.100
better, so I can look down here on the Vector

67
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.100
where it is, and probably 6 and

68
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.100
-6. There we go, smack bang in the middle of

69
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.100
that square now! If I simply hold down

70
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.100
Shift, at the same time as R, it repeats the

71
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.100
last operation. So Shift and R will lay down another

72
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.100
linked pawn, and again, we'll do another

73
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.100
linked pawn. And you can do that as many times as you like, it's a very powerful

74
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.566
operation.

75
00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:51.566
OK guys, it's challenge time! I'd like you to fill

76
00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:55.566
out the board! So remember to link duplicate the pawns

77
00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:59.566
and two bishops, only making the white pieces,

78
00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:03.566
at the moment. We'll do something, later on, to create all of the black ones. Now,

79
00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:07.566
place them in the right starting position on the board. Now, you may

80
00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:11.566
have to refer to reference material, in order to make sure the board's at the right

81
00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:15.566
orientation for us. And then, finally create an empty

82
00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:19.566
called white pieces. Pause the video now and give

83
00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:23.566
that a go! OK guys, welcome back!

84
00:05:23.566 --> 00:05:26.666
Let's hop straight back over into Blender!

85
00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:31.066
Alright, so I've duplicated down here, and I don't want to

86
00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:35.066
do that, in this case. So fortunately, I've got some undo buffer I can exploit.

87
00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:39.066
Now, I know that this pawn was placed exactly

88
00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:43.066
in the right place, so we're mucking about with it, I think. Let's just

89
00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:47.066
go up here. No not quite, but I can

90
00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:51.066
set it back to 0 and 0 here,

91
00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:55.066
and then, it's right bang in the middle of the board. Then, I can turn on Snapping, because

92
00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:59.066
we're using whole units, and I can move it to the right position here

93
00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:03.066
and down a little so it's around here. Before I go any

94
00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:07.066
further though, I know that, from reference material, that

95
00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:11.066
the white side of the board has the black square in the left

96
00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:15.066
corner and a white square in the right corner, so that

97
00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:19.066
would be this way around or that way around. So

98
00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:23.066
at the moment, I'm about to set it up playing across the wrong way on the board.

99
00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:27.066
I'm going to move that down to there and across to here,

100
00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:31.066
and that should be snack bang in the middle, whole numbers here, exactly what

101
00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:35.066
I want to see over in the Transform. Alright, so the

102
00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:39.066
next thing I want to do is Duplicate Linked, this pawn here.

103
00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:43.066
So that's Alt and D, and there you go, he's linked. And I can

104
00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:44.466
see that the Z is

105
00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:48.833
changing, down in the lower-left, so I do want to lock the Z axis so it's not

106
00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:52.833
moving, and I just want to place it there! Brilliant! Now, to do

107
00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:56.833
the next step, I'm simply going to repeat that operation by holding down

108
00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.833
Shift and R. OK, 1, 2, 3, 4,

109
00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:04.833
5, 6. Perfect! Of course,

110
00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:08.833
what we're looking at here is a couple of, in the Outliner here, there's

111
00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:12.833
lots of corrections to do. So perhaps before I

112
00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:16.833
do the repeating, I should have renamed it, so fortunately,

113
00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:20.833
with the undo thing, we can do that relatively quickly. I'm just

114
00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:24.833
going to name that White Pawn, for the moment, I'm going to rename it.

115
00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:28.833
Then, I'm going to duplicate it, lock it to the Z axis, and move it across.

116
00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:32.833
Then, I'm going to hold down Shift and R to repeat that process.

117
00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:36.833
That's much better! All the way down to there.

118
00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:40.833
Brilliant! And then finally, we can do the bishop again. Now, I'm not quite sure where

119
00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:44.833
the bishop is, so again, I'm just going to lock it to whole numbers here. I'm going to type

120
00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:48.833
in 0, 0, and 0 there.

121
00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:52.833
That appeared above the board or I've managed to type 9, that's not very cleaver

122
00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:56.833
of me, it's next to 0, of course. And there we go, so it's

123
00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.833
0, 0, 0. Now, with Snapping turned on and Increments, we can move

124
00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:04.833
that down and... Ooh, where does that go? It goes there, doesn't it?

125
00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:08.833
Knight, rook, knight, bishop. That's fine! And goes

126
00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:12.833
back one, and then, again, a linked duplicate,

127
00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:16.833
locked to the Z axis, move it across to there, and

128
00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:20.833
perfect! So that chess board's really coming on now with the pieces on it,

129
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:24.833
and we've got all of our stuff setup. Now, this hierarchy

130
00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:28.833
along here is starting to get a bit messy. I wonder if there's something we can do about that?

131
00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:33.133
And speaking about the hierarchy, I have noticed that I don't have an empty...

132
00:08:33.133 --> 00:08:37.133
Yeah, ooh, I almost forgot that bit of the challenge! So of course, I need to go

133
00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:41.133
to Add, Empty. Now, I've got a choice of empties here, and I'm not quite

134
00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:45.133
sure which one I'm going to pick. I think, for the purpose of this, I am

135
00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:49.133
simply going to pick a Plane Axis. It doesn't really matter,

136
00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:53.133
it's not going to be much in the way of any use to us. And where

137
00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:57.133
it's positioned, we can sort that out later. We do need to name it though,

138
00:08:57.133 --> 00:09:01.133
so I'm going to rename that, and I'm going to name it White

139
00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:05.133
Pieces. There we go! So that's all ready for us later on!

140
00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:09.666
Now, we will deal with this hierarchy and organize this a bit

141
00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:13.666
in the next couple of lectures, so don't worry about that for the moment. But what I would like

142
00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:17.666
to see is how you guys are getting on, so please share your results, so far,

143
00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:21.666
in the discussions, and I will see you in the next lecture! Take

144
00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:23.400
care!
