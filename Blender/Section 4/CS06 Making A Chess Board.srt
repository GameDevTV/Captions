00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Making a

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Chess Board! So in this video we're going to start making our chess

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
board! We're going to take over the cube object, and that will become

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
clear in a moment, and then finally, use the grid mesh

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to create a grid that we can work from. So let's

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,333
hop straight on over into Blender!

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:27,333
So here we are over in Blender, and we've got our default

8
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:31,333
cube in the scene itself. Now, the reason why we're going to

9
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:35,333
take over this object, rather than just make our grid

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,333
mesh straight away, is we cannot be in Edit Mode and easily

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,833
see what's going on.

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,500
So, if I go to add Mesh, Grid...

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,500
You can see that's in there. I'm just going to move the Radius

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,500
up. It's quite hard to see where the grid is itself.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,500
If I apply that new object and go into Edit Mode,

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,166
we can see our grid absolutely fine.

17
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:03,166
However, now we can't change the amount of subdivisions, because it's already

18
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,166
set. So how do we go about making sure that

19
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,766
we can control the subdivisions

20
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,600
and then create the mesh?

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,233
So what we are going to do is take

22
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:17,233
over the cube. So I'm just going to get rid of that, I'm going to go

23
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:21,233
select the cube itself, the cube object, hop into

24
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:25,233
Edit Mode, and then, Delete it. Now, if

25
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:29,233
we have a look over in the Outliner, we can see

26
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:33,233
both objects still exist, the Grid and the Cube. They've got no geometry in this,

27
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:37,233
but the objects themselves still exist, and I'm going to get

28
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:41,233
rid of this one here, I'm going to get rid of our Grid

29
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:45,233
and I'm going to call our Cube Chess

30
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:49,233
Board. Very inventive! As you can probably tell, I'm quite lean

31
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:53,233
with what's going on here, and I'm also just Save my file in my project

32
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:57,233
folder and call it Chesboard. So

33
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:01,233
I've got my chess board mockup. Now, I'm going to do it properly, so Chess Board.

34
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:05,233
There we go!, so that's saved in my project folder!

35
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:09,233
Now, in Edit Mode, if you go and create the

36
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:13,233
same mesh again, a Mesh object and a Grid, you can

37
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,233
see it straight away. Now, you may be very tempted

38
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:21,233
to create this 8 by 8 grid that comes naturally.

39
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:25,233
If we look over in the Operator Panel, you can see that's actually

40
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:29,233
10 by 10, that's actually 9 by 9. So what happens here is the

41
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:33,233
Subdivision are usually 1 higher than the actual number of

42
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:37,233
real divisions you want, because it includes one of the edges. And then finally, we've got

43
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:41,233
our Radius here. Now, I don't actually want to create our whole

44
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:45,233
board at once, because I don't really want to go in and color in black,

45
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:49,233
white, black, white throughout the entire thing. I just want a small section so I

46
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:53,233
have basically a 2 by 2 grid that we can apply a modifier

47
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:57,233
to and actually get our whole board.

48
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:01,233
So I need to lower the Subdivisions, all the way down to

49
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:05,233
3 and 3. I think that will give us a,

50
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:09,233
yep, a 2 by 2 grid! Now, we need to get the size right! Now, the Radius,

51
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:13,233
remember the Radius is from the middle outwards, and so if that's going

52
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:17,233
to be one of our squares, we can set that to

53
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:21,233
6 actually, because we're going to go 1 to

54
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:25,233
1 on that. So that is an accurate representation

55
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:29,233
of where we're going with our board. So 6

56
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:33,233
Radius out is a 6 by 6 square, and that's going to be 6 by 6

57
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:37,133
centimeters and we're going to work through that scale throughout our model.

58
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,133
OK guys, it's challenge time! I'd like you to finish

59
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:45,133
the board. So first of all, create a white material

60
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:49,133
and a black material, and apply those materials

61
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,166
to the board.

62
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,866
Then, go ahead to use two array modifiers. You can do them

63
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:58,866
together or individually, to create the rest

64
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:02,866
of the board. Now, apply those modifiers as you go or,

65
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:06,866
indeed, you can apply them all at the end, that's up to you. Finally, don't

66
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:10,866
worry about the board not being centered, we're going to be dealing with that

67
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:14,866
in the next lecture. Pause the video now and give that a

68
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:18,866
go! OK guys, welcome back!

69
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,566
Let's hop over into Blender!

70
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:25,566
So we have our 2 by 2 grid here! Let's go ahead

71
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:29,566
and create our two materials, first of all. So I'm going to go over

72
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:33,566
to this Properties Panel over here and

73
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:37,566
go to the Material type. So I'm going to

74
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:41,566
create our first material. In fact, there's already one here, so I'm going to call this

75
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,033
White Square.

76
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,466
Excellent! And just make sure, down

77
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:51,466
here, it is set to bright white, as white as it can possibly be.

78
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:55,466
Now, I'm going to go to Face Select Mode and Select these two

79
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:59,466
other faces here and create another material,

80
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,466
and you've guessed it, we're going to call it Black Square!

81
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,166
Now that we've got those two made...

82
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:11,166
I've also got to change the... I'm going to Assign the material

83
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:15,166
and then change the Diffuse color here, I'm going to ramp it

84
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:19,166
all the way down to complete black.

85
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:23,166
Excellent! So those are our materials made, and, in fact, that's our object,

86
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:27,166
so I'm going to hop back into Object Mode, because we're going to apply a modifier.

87
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:31,166
So we've got our starting grid going, so we're going to have to

88
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,166
create one modifier, first of all, and it's going to be a

89
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:39,166
repeat four times. So we're going to Create an Array Modifier,

90
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:43,166
and we can have them next to each other, so a relative offset,

91
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:47,166
and four. So there we go, 1, 2, 3, 4, that's great! And I'm

92
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,166
going to Copy the modifier, and, of course, it's going to apply

93
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:55,166
for those as well and we don't what that. In this case, we want

94
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,166
a Relative Offset the other direction, so in Y by 1,

95
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:03,166
and we can keep it to 4, as well. There we go, that's

96
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:07,166
our grid up really quickly! Now, the great thing about

97
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:11,166
using this Array Modifier, and we can see there are two here, Array one

98
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:15,166
and Array 2, or Array and Array.001. And

99
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,166
because it's an array, when we go back to our

100
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:23,166
original mesh and change anything, it will propogate across

101
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,166
our entire board, so we wouldn't have to modify all of these squares individually, very

102
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,166
very powerful!

103
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,166
Alright, so the final thing to do here is just apply our

104
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:36,166
Array Modifier, so I'm going to apply that one and finally

105
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,166
Apply this one! So now, we've changed our mesh

106
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,233
about!

107
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,900
That's great, so we've made

108
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,900
our chess board! How did you guys get on? Please share

109
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,533
in the discussions, and I will see you in the next lecture!
