00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Welcome to Managing the Chess Scene Assets!

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:05,666
So in this video we're going to decide how

3
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:09,666
we can manage our materials! We'll be creating materials

4
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:13,666
in one .blend file, not multiple but just one file,

5
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,666
and then,  learning that each project will have

6
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:21,666
a different way of handling materials, depending on the project's

7
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:25,666
size and scope. So materials in our project! If we

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:29,666
think about it, we've got 32 pieces in total,

9
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:33,666
black and white 16 of each. We've got a board that

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,666
has black and white squares, and finally, a wooden surround, finally.

11
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:41,666
So we've got five materials in our project. So what

12
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,666
we're going to do is, we're going to assign materials in a

13
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:49,666
Chess Scene .blend file. We've already assigned a material

14
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,666
to the board, that's absolutely fine, that will be brought into our Chess

15
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:57,666
Scene anyway, and we can work on it from there.

16
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:01,666
So it's challenge time, for you guys! I'd like you to create a

17
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:05,666
chess scene. There's not going to be much in it, but it's just

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,666
to get across what we've learned so far. So we're going to create

19
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,666
a new .blend file, we're going to append the

20
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:17,666
chess board and the pawn into one scene, and this will

21
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:21,666
give us a great feedback as to how our pawn is now looking,

22
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:25,666
in the scene itself. Finally, after you've created

23
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:29,666
this new .blend file, what I'd like you to do is go to your project folder

24
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:33,666
on your computer and archive the chess board, the original one, and the

25
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:37,666
pawn .blend files on your computer. Because we've brought it in, we're now going to

26
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:41,666
be editing it in this file only, so we don't want any confusion

27
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:45,666
later on. So pause the video now, and give that a go!

28
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,666
OK guys, welcome back! Let's

29
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:53,200
hop over into Blender!

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
So let's open up a new .blend file!

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
So New, Reload Start-Up File. That's absolutely fine!

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm going to get rid of this cube, straight away!

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm going to go to File, Append,

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,200
find my project folder, and I'm going to bring in

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
the pawn... Oops, too far! Object,

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Chess Piece Base. Ah, I didn't name it, so I can rename

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
it in a moment, when it enters our scene. That's fine, let's go to the Outliner

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
now and make sure that's named correctly, from henceforth.

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm going to call this Primary

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,200
White Pawn,

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,200
and the reason for that is, there'll be a primary black one, later on,

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
as well. So that's the pawn into our scene, and we need to Append

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
the chess board now. So let's go across

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200
into our

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,200
assets folder, and there we have Chess Board, Object.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Chess Board is named correctly, which is great! Append From Library,

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
that's great! So the final thing we'll want to do here is just remove

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,200
this grid. We've already got our own stage, which is the chess

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
board itself, so we don't need this grid, anymore, here.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,200
So I'm going to open up the Properties Pane, and as we scroll down,

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
there's our Display. Now, on

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
this Display, if we drop that down a little,

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
we can... Where is it? ...Grid Floor, here it is! We can turn that

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,933
off, and when we do that,

55
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,966
we've got our board without that grid underneath it.

56
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:37,966
So there we go, we've got our pawn in here, and

57
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:41,966
if we select our pawn, we can move it on our board and that's great! And

58
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:45,966
we can see that it is the right size, compared to the rest of the board,

59
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:47,966
it suits the board quite nicely.

60
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:51,966
And the final thing, of course, is to name our scene. So

61
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,966
I'm going to go into File, Save As, and I'm just going to

62
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:59,966
call this Chess Scene. There we go!

63
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:03,966
Save the Blender file, and we can see at the top, it's saved as it's new name.

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
So that's all of the stuff done in Blender itself. Finally, we just need to

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,400
clear up our project folder that we're working on. So I've got my low

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
poly chess set here. I'm going to create a new folder and call it

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Archive and actually spell it right, for once. And

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,400
we've got Low Poly Pawn, that we're working on, and ChessScene. So the

69
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Low Poly Pawn can go into the archive, because we just brought that in, and I'm happy that

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
that's finalized. Low Poly Chess Piece Base, we're going to

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,400
leave that, because we need that for the rest of our pieces. All of the other stuff that we've

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
been working on, apart from Chess Scene, can be moved out of the way.

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Now, don't worry if you see some extra stuff there that you might not have made,

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,766
because I do a lot of tinkering. So there we go! So in your

75
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,833
folder, you should have two files left over, Low Poly

76
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,833
Chess Piece Base, which we're going to use for the rest of our models, and our ChessScene

77
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,833
.blend. So that's all of those sorted out!

78
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Brilliant! How did you guys get on? Please share in the discussions,

79
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,133
and I will see you in the next lecture!
