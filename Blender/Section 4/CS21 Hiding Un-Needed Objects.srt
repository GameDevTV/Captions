00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,666
Welcome to Hiding Un-Needed Objects!

2
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:06,666
In this video, we're going to discover it's useful when

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:10,666
working on larger and more complex assemblies or scenes.

4
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:14,666
So, at the moment, we're only dealing with a chess set, but it's good to grasp

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:18,666
this notion before you start dealing with something even more complex,

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:22,666
where perhaps parts are hidden behind one another. And we're going to control

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:26,666
whether you're hiding groups of objects, as well as individuals

8
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,666
themselves. So let's go play with this over in Blender!

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,666
Alright, so here we are in Blender! The first thing I'm going to

10
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,666
do is just free up a bit of space. Oh, that didn't work terribly

11
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:42,666
well! Let's hide that and hide that. There we go!

12
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,666
And switch over to Solid, no particular reason other than I can see

13
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:50,666
what's selected and what isn't. So, as you can tell here, as you're

14
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:54,666
selecting things, you get the orange marker around them. And to hide something, well it's an

15
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,666
object operation. So we go to Object on the 3D Editor

16
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:02,666
Header, and I'm going to have to scroll up with the low resolution I'm running.

17
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:06,666
And here we have Show and Hide, and we can see there are three options,

18
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,666
when it comes to hiding. So there's Show Hidden and that will show everything that you've hidden so

19
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,666
far, bringing everything back into view. With hide Selected, so if you've

20
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:18,666
selected an object or multiple objects, you can hide them all at

21
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,666
once. And then, finally Hide Unselected, so that's like a

22
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,666
inverse hidden. So if I only wanted this pawn here,

23
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,666
I could select the pawn like it is already, go object,

24
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,666
Show and Hide, and Hide_Unselected.

25
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:38,666
And there we go, we just have the pawn

26
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:42,666
visible. Now, of course, we can bring everything back with Alt and H,

27
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:46,666
and then, we can select a couple of pawns here, let's say, and press H

28
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:50,666
to hide them away, so it's very powerful! Now, there's another option for

29
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:54,666
doing this, over in the Outliner. So if we bring everything

30
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:58,666
back into view, with Alt and H or do the menu option,

31
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:02,666
there if you want to. OK, so we have our white

32
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:06,666
pieces all grouped together and there's a little eye next to them. So you can

33
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:10,666
go to... I'm expanding the hierarchy here. You can go to where it says White Bishops

34
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:14,666
and click the little eye, and it will start turning things off.

35
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,666
But why hasn't it turned the bishops off? Well underneath

36
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,666
that you have the bishops themselves. So that's grouped,

37
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,666
it has an empty called White Bishops, but it's not going to hid everything underneath.

38
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:30,666
Similar to what we explored before, you're going to have to hold down Control,

39
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,666
as you click the eye to hide everything underneath that

40
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,666
hierarchy. So if we have the WhitePieces and hold down Control,

41
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,666
as we're clicking the eye, we can hide all of the White

42
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,666
Pieces, if you've got that hierarchy. If you've not, you can

43
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,666
go down and, for instance, go down and hide all the White Pawns or hide all the White Bishops,

44
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,666
whilst holding down Control itself. Otherwise, you'd

45
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:58,666
have to go in and click them individually like that. So if you've got a

46
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,666
good naming structure, but it's quite difficult to select items, you can

47
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,666
just hide them through this Outliner Menu or hierarchy itself.

48
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,566
OK guys, it's challenge time!

49
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:13,500
Now, there are going to be several ways that you could accomplish this, I don't

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
mind how you do it, but I'd like you to hide everything but the

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,500
board. So hide all the chess pieces, in our scene,

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,500
leaving just the checkered squares, so far, and we're going to build out the rest of

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
the board in a bit. So pause the video now and give that a go!

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
OK guys, welcome back! let's hop straight

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,600
back over into Blender!

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,100
OK, so there are a couple

57
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,100
of options! As you've probably seen already, you could just control

58
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,100
click the WhitePieces over here,

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,100
and when we've Control clicked them, they all disappear leaving

60
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,100
just the board itself. Alternatively, you could select the board

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,100
and do Shift and H, and hide everything but the board.

62
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,100
Remember there's still the lamps in our scene, as well

63
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,100
as the Camera, and, at the moment, it gives us a nice clean workspace, if

64
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,100
we hide absolutely everything but the board itself. Brilliant!

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,633
So now, you've done that, please share in the discussions, and

66
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,266
I will see you in the next lecture!
