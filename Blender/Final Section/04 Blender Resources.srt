00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,433
Hey guys, let's talk about some Blender resources!

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:07,433
OK, if you didn't remember when, in the first section of

3
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:11,433
the course, I was talking about a 3 Button Mouse, I still recommend

4
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:15,433
one of those. A Full Size Keyboard often helps,

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:19,433
as well so you've got the number pad on the side that you can use to

6
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:23,433
control your view. A dedicated GPU! Now, of

7
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:27,433
course, that's not going to be an option for many laptop users, unless

8
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:31,433
your laptop has already got one, but obviously, if

9
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:35,433
you've got a desktop, there is the potential of upgrading your graphics card

10
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:39,433
in order to get your renders done in much less

11
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:43,433
time. Now do bear in mind a dedicated GPU, we're talking

12
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:47,433
about the performance end of the spectrum, sort of mid level

13
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:51,433
and higher, just a basic dedicated GPU in your system

14
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:55,433
is not going to increase your render time. So make sure

15
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:59,433
you go, first, on the NVidia side probably a 960

16
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:03,433
970+ at the moment, at the time of recording they've not got anything new out,

17
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:07,433
and a similar sort of spec on the AMD side.

18
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:11,433
Recommended Reading! Well there is a lovely

19
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:15,433
Blender, sort of, crib sheet with an info graphic,

20
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:19,433
as it says there, with all of the shortcut keys on it. And "Learning Blender"

21
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:23,433
by Oliver Villar! We'll just have a quick look at what those two

22
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,200
look like!

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,600
OK, so as you can see here, this info graphic is pretty

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
awesome, it's got almost every key you'll

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
ever need on it. Not necessarily the best laid out thing,

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I find it quite stressful going through there, but it is a very useful

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
sheet that you can print out and use. Now this is for version

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
2.76, which is brilliant! It's got everything we need on it,

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
so go and check that out! And the book, "Learning Blender" Hands On

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,600
by Oliver Villar, well it looks like this here.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
A really good book, quite a short book, but it really gets you down

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
and into Blender really quickly. OK,

33
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:06,700
so let's have a look at a couple of Blender Extras!

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,700
There's blendswap.com, that's a brilliant place to

35
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,700
check out other people's work or even share your own, if you produce

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,700
something that you want to share with the community. And then, you've got the Blender

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,200
Demo Files! So let's go have a quick look at those!

38
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:26,266
OK, so here we are on www.blendswap.com!

39
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:30,266
You will have to sign up for an account, if you want to use it,

40
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,266
and it gives you a great place to share and also download

41
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:38,266
.blend files, as well. Do be careful, read the description of

42
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:42,266
any licenses, if you want to use someone's assets for your

43
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:46,266
own projects. Oh, if it's just a personal project, then sure go ahead and use

44
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,266
it, but remember to read the license agreements. We don't want anybody to get into trouble,

45
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:54,266
by using someone else's assets in

46
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:58,266
their project that they haven't asked permission for, so do read

47
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:02,266
those carefully! And the demo files themselves, on the Blender

48
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:06,266
website. So if you go to Blender.org and click

49
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:10,266
on Download at the top, and once you've done that,

50
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:14,266
along the middle of the page here we have Demo Files,

51
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:18,266
External Renderers, etc. Demo Files is right there and you can

52
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:22,033
check out some of the files that are available, see

53
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,733
what your computer behaves like with some

54
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,433
more of these highly

55
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,666
detailed Blender files. And of course, the BMW

56
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,666
Benchmark is quite a common one, used to spec

57
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:38,666
out a computer or check it and benchmark it against

58
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:42,666
other computers. And of course, this is the one we actually use in the course, as

59
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,766
well.

60
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,566
That's it for now!

61
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,866
Carry on Blending!
