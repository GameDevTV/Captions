[Sings] Da da da da da da da da! Hi,

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.433
guys, what's next? What do you guys want to do next?

3
00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:09.633
So Blender Resources, what's out

4
00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:13.633
there for you guys? Well Recommended Hardware! If I've not mentioned

5
00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:17.633
it enough already, but I do recommend you go and get yourself a 3

6
00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.633
Buttoned Mouse. Even though you can use Blender with lots of other

7
00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:25.633
control surfaces, I do still think that's the best. And a Full Size Keyboard with

8
00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:29.633
that number pad on the side can be a god send, especially when you're working

9
00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.633
from multiple angles with a model. So Recommended Reading!

10
00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.633
We've got these Blender shortcut keys here. These are all linked, by

11
00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:41.633
the way, you can go straight to the lecture notes

12
00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:45.633
earlier on in the section and download this and you can

13
00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:49.633
even view it on there and click these links to guide you through. So we've got an excellent

14
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.633
shortcut keys, a full print out that you can have,

15
00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:57.633
and then, we've got a book. We've looked around at different

16
00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:01.633
books. If some of you love learning from books, then we've got this

17
00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:05.633
"Learning Blender" by Oliver Villar, and you can go get that over on

18
00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:09.633
Amazon or a good book store.

19
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:13.633
Example Blend Files! So some of you guys will want to know more about

20
00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:17.633
you know more inspiration, actually see the detail that's involved in other .blend files.

21
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:21.633
Well we've got Blend Swap, it's a wonderful place where

22
00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:25.633
you can go and get 3D models from. Do bear in mind

23
00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:29.633
that each model that's listed on there will have a

24
00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:33.633
certain licensing agreement. So don't just go and steal their stuff,

25
00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:37.633
make sure you adhere to the person who's created it license agreement. Some of them will

26
00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:41.633
say cool, just use this for whatever you want without citation

27
00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:45.633
and everything else. Some people will want full credit-ation for it,

28
00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:49.633
etc., and we don't want you guys getting into some sort of legal mess. And on the

29
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:53.633
Blender website itself they have some Blender demo files, which are great

30
00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:57.633
to check out and see what's going on. OK

31
00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:01.633
that's it for now! Take care guys!
