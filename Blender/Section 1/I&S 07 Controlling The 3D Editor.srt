00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Controlling the 3D Editor!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
By the end of this video, you'll be able to do the following.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You'll be able to rotate or orbit around any of your models.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll be able to pan to the left and the right

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and up and down. We'll be able to switch between the standard view

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
types, so we can look at our models from different angles, and we'll

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
also learn about the difference between Perspective and Orthographic

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Projection. So let's go load up a brand new blend file

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and give that a go! OK, so I'm in a brand new blend file

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
here, and I am going to have my three button

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
mouse emulation turned on, so I can show you guys it working. I do have

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
a three button mouse, and I would recommend getting one. They're tiny, they don't have to

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
be connected to the computer, they work wirelessly. It's great and it saves you a lot of time!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But if you're restricted to space, I understand that, that's fine!

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So I'm just going to make sure it's turn on. File and

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
User Preferences, and, under the Input section, Emulate

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
3 Button Mouse. So I need to put a tick in that box and Save User Settings.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So we start off with rotating around your

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
object. So we can rotate by holding down

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the Middle Mouse Button. I'm not going to do that too quickly, just in case I make you guys

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
a bit seasick. If you don't have a three button

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
mouse, what you can do is hold down Alt,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and then, hold down the Left Mouse Button. Once you've done that,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you can do the same thing. For panning left and right, you have to

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
hold down Shift and then the Middle Mouse Button. If you

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
press that down, you'll be able to pan to the left and right and up and down.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now you might have guessed it, if you want to pan and you don't have a three button

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
mouse, you hold down Alt and Shift, and then,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you'll be able to left click and move the screen around by panning.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you want to zoom in and out and you don't have a three

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
button mouse, once again you hold down Alt and then

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Control. Once you've held down Alt and Control, you can press the

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Left Mouse Button and zoom in and out. If you do have a three button mouse then,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
of course, you can use the Scroll Wheel to move backwards and forwards.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, one of the things that I do like in Blender, and I'll show you

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
how I like setting up Blender, is under the

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
View and User Preferences, I like taking

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
control of what I'm orbiting around. And

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
by Default it kind of orbits around an abstract

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
point, so I want to change that. So if we go to the

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Interface tab, under the middle column we will see

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that we can Rotate Around Selection. That

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
is a very powerful one. That means if that's ticked, and I go and Save

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the User Settings, when I've got something selected and that is

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
it has this orange outline around it, I can orbit

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
around that object. It doesn't matter where in my view it is,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will orbit around it, which is very very

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
powerful, and that's the standard that I have Blender setup with.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now, in order to switch between the standard view types, there are a couple of options that

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you can choose. We can go ahead and go to the View menu,

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
down on the 3D Editor Header Toolbar down here,

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and having a look up here, we've got a series of views. There's

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
tons and tons of options here. You'll start to get used to Blender having

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
lots of different shortcut keys. So we can go to the View menu here

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and go and look at it from the Left, the Right, the Back, the Front, the Top, the Bottom,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
etc. And if we choose to do that, we can see that there's a numberpad

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
associated with them. So if I press numberpad 1 or go to View and

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
click Front, it will move around to the Front view, and it's as straightforward

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
as that. And I can actually go on my numberpad and go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
etc. going through the numbers there. Now, if I press

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
numberpad 5, or indeed if you've got Numberpad Emulation turned

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
on, just the number 5 on top of your keyboard; you'll find that

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it switches between Perspective and

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Orthographic. Now the difference between Perspective and Orthographic

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is quite pronounced. You will end up

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
with... Well when it's in Perspective, if there were two cubes here and one

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
was in the distance, and they were identical, we would find

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that the one in the background would be smaller, because it's further away, that's how

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
we see things in real life. However, if we switch to Orthographic projection

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
things look slightly different. In fact, on the cube itself, this has equal

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
sides but the ones at the back look smaller, because of perspective.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wth Orthographic projection turn one, it doesn't matter how

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
far away the object is from your view, and that

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
basically means that everything is the size it really is, whether it's

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
right in front of you or, you know, far off in the distance.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Both cubes, if we had two of them set in the distance, would be

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
identical. OK guys, it's challenge time!

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What I'd like you to do is literally go crazy! Zoom in and

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
out, try panning and rotating around the default cube!

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Really get the hang of this control, because you're going to be using it lots

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and lots. After you've played about with moving around your view

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
with the mouse or your trackpad, switch between

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
various views. Try out that numberpad or turn on Numpad

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Emulation, and use the keys at the top of your keyboard. Or indeed use the

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
View menu, that's a little slower. Sometimes I only use menus and sometimes

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I use the keyboard shortcuts, it does depend how I'm feeling. [Laughs]

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So switch between the various views, play with that. So pause the video now,

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and give that a go!

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
OK guys, welcome back! Let's just play with that over in Blender!

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
OK, so I can see I'm in Orthographic Projection at the

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
moment, because up in the top-left it says User Ortho. If I hit the

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Numpad 5, it'll change to Perspective! That's great! And

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
looking at these arrows here, it looks like I'm upside down, so I'll go

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and rotate around. That's looking pretty good! OK,

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
can we pan around and put this...? Yes we can! And I've got Orbiting

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
turned on around this object, so it'll stay there as we go around

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
it. If we didn't have that turned on, by the way, I might as well show you what it looks like

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
without it turned on, so I'm going to turn Rotate Around Selection to

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
turned off, and then... Ooh, I made that full screen!

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Then, when we're rotating, you see it sort of orbits the mid point of the view itself,

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
so around here, it's not as easy to control

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
moving around a particular object. We have to rotate, go here, rotate. Ooh,

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've gone too far! So with that turned on... Let's go back.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Where are we here? User Preferences and

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
then Rotate Around Selection under the Interface tab. I'm going to Save

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
my User Settings, so it stays there, and now, I'm rotating around

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
that cube itself. Brilliant! How did you guys get on?

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I hope you're able to move around in Blender now, and I will see you guys

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,666
in the next lecture!
