00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to the Blender Layout Overview!

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, this is one of these things that most people, when they open up Blender, go

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
what do I do here? It is a very confusing interface,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
if you haven't used 3D modeling packages before.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And some of it isn't quite intuitive, but don't worry, we'll take you through it

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
step by step now. So in this video, Blender looks

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the same on all platforms. And this is great, it does mean that whether you're working on a

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Mac, a PC, or a box running Linux it will

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
look the same. And you will see why that is, it's kind of its own

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
self contained environment. So it doesn't use the File, edit, View,

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Tools, Window that you typically see on the top of most

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
applications. I'll be going through how to switch and change

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
layouts. It's a very cool feature where you can actually save a layout, if you've

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
found one that you like working with and, of course, you can immediately switch to it as well,

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that's very very powerful! Go through the main sections

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of the Blender interface, all the different window types you can have within this one

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
interface. And how to move and change Blender's layout. It's a

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
very powerful tool, and it's got lots of different variety

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that you can setup. And of course, we're all using different monitor sizes.

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Some of us are on a laptop, some of us have got a whopping great bit 4K monitor

21
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in front of us. So the way that you setup Blender will be slightly differently,

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
based upon this. So without further ado, let's hop on over

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.533
into Blender!

24
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.400
So welcome back into Blender! And the first thing that we're going to cover,

25
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.400
in this and the next lecture, is the layout. So we'll start with a brief overview

26
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.400
of the layout here, to get you guys into it. It is a bit

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.400
confusing for newcomers and old hats at 3D modeling. It

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.400
is a complete unique interface.

29
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.400
It allows massive amounts of customization, which is

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400
where some of the confusion could come from, because with all of that customization,

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.400
all that power that you have, we need to learn how to control that, and

32
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400
before we get into the nitty gritty of modeling. I know you're itching to start making stuff,

33
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.400
but let's make sure that we understand the tool that we're using

34
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.400
a bit better, before we dive in and start modeling. Trust me on this,

35
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400
if you can't control the interface it will bug you forevermore. So let's come

36
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400
on and have look at the general interface here. So at the very top,

37
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.400
we can see it says File, Render, Window, Help,

38
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.400
and we've got this area here. This is Default. Now this whole area at the very top is

39
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.400
an Info Header. We can change that, we can move it, that's the power

40
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.400
of Blender. Unfortunately, if we move and hide it away it can be

41
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.400
difficult to find again. But don't worry, we'll go over how to resurrect missing

42
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.400
frames, if we need to. So we've got 5

43
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400
frames or windows on this particular screen. We've got the Info Header

44
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.400
at the top. This big one in the middle is the 3D Editor window.

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.400
In fact, if we hover over the Header Bar's icon, on the left-hand side,

46
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.400
we can see that it says the current editor type for this area is Info.

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400
If we go down here, it will say the current editor type is 3D

48
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.400
View, and then, we can go down here and this'll be Timeline. Now, we've got two

49
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400
more on the right-hand side here. We've got Outliner and

50
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.333
we have Properties.

51
00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:17.300
Now these icons themselves, if we click on them,

52
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.300
they give us the option for all the other view types that we have in Blender,

53
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.300
so you can go ahead and change those. You can even have two of the

54
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.300
same if necessary. So later on in the course, I definitely need

55
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.300
two of these Propertiy windows. For instance, because they've got

56
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.300
all of these tabs going across the top, and occasionally I don't want to keep

57
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.300
flicking backwards and forwards between two. An example earlier on in the

58
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.300
course, I might have two 3D windows open so I can move

59
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.300
this one up here, using this split between the two, this horizontal

60
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.300
line. There's also a vertical line that we can move to the left and right

61
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.300
as well and obviously change this bottom one to a 3D view. And then, I can

62
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.300
work on the same model from different angles or different view points,

63
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.300
which is very very powerful. So I'll just pop that back to how it

64
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.300
was and we can have a look at some of the other features as well.

65
00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:13.500
Now we can resize those if we want to. We

66
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.500
can grab this vertical line that splits the two windows

67
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.500
up and move it from left to right, and you will find

68
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.500
me doing that a lot in this course. I'm running at 720

69
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.500
DP, so you guys can see what I'm doing with ease. Unfortunately

70
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.500
that gets a bit cramped [laughs] on my particular screen, so I'm often

71
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.500
moving things about, hiding them, etc. moving them backwards and

72
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.500
forwards. So I will often hide this thing to one side and then pull it out

73
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500
OK, and when I need to make some changes, I try and leave it static because obviously

74
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.500
it takes up time moving things about. If you're working with a different monitor resolution,

75
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.500
bear in mind I'm at 720 P here. You could be at 4K you know, or

76
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.500
even 5K if you've got one of those 5K iMacs. So there's a vast

77
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.500
array of sizes that we can work with in Blender. And of course,

78
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
each one of use will have a slightly different layout, and we can customize

79
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.500
this to our own desire. Now, one of the most important things

80
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.500
is, before we start tweaking and moving things about is, that you're not

81
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.500
working on the Default Layout, otherwise you can't get back to it easily. So looking at

82
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.500
the Header Bar again, we can see here that it says Default.

83
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.500
That is the current view that we're working on. If I go to the

84
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.500
drop-down, just to the left of the word Default, we can see that there are

85
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.500
a series here of pre-defined views. And if we go ahead

86
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.500
and click on 3D Full View, we can see that we've got a completely

87
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.500
different view to what we had before. We can go to Compositing,

88
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.500
and that's a different type of workflow, so it gives you some

89
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.500
windows that are appropriate to that. We can go to, I've made a couple here as

90
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.500
well. So we've got Motion Tracking as well. And to make something, you

91
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.500
simply find something that you is close... So we can go back to Default here.

92
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500
You can find something that's close to what you want and hit the Plus Button.

93
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.500
Once you hit that Plus Button we've added a new screen, and we can name

94
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.500
this whatever we like. So I can just call this Layout.

95
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.500
Now that we've changed it to Layout, because that's what's selected at the top

96
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.500
there, we can change everything on this screen to our heart's content,

97
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.500
without worrying about overwriting that Default Layout.

98
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.500
Very very powerful! Now, you'll notice that each of these

99
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.500
areas has a Header Bar, and every one of them, apart from the

100
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.500
Info window, has an actual window associated

101
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.500
with that Header. Now the Info does actually have

102
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.500
another window. If we click here we see that we get this double-headed arrow with a line

103
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.500
in between, on this break between the two windows. And

104
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.500
if I drag that down, we can see here it gives us almost like a

105
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.500
console of what's happening in the background. Now, often I will just hide that

106
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.500
out of the way, because it's not useful, however, bringing that down can help

107
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.500
with some sort of diagnostics later on. But I'm going to

108
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.500
now click and drag that back up and hide it out of the way.

109
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.500
Now, you can do that for all of the windows. You can re-size them and

110
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.500
move them about with ease. You can also

111
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.500
hide and move things that are part of that window. So the typical one

112
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.500
that I see a lot and gets people is the Header Bar.

113
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.500
You can actually hide the Header Bar. So you think that you're moving these windows

114
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.500
and resizing them, which is great, but you accidentally do this!

115
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.500
And you can see, instead of being at the bottom of the Header Bar here,

116
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
I'm actually at the top of the Header Bar and the arrow looks the same. So you quickly glance, you go OK,

117
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.500
Oh where has my Header Bar gone?

118
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.500
Well you can get it back. There's a little plus on the lower right-hand

119
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.500
side of that particular window, or the upper right-hand side if you move the Header

120
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.500
to the top, and I'll show you that in a few moments. And if we click that plus, the Header

121
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.500
Bar reappears. Now, if you are working with limited

122
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.500
space or you've changed the size of your windows here, we can

123
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.500
help collapse these words, the menu options on any

124
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.500
Header Bar, by right-clicking on the Header Bar and collapsing menus.

125
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.500
It then appears as these three lines here that we can click on and get to the

126
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.500
same options that we had before. So I'm going to undo that, for

127
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500
the moment, by right-clicking and undoing Collapse Menus. We've

128
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.500
got Flip to Top, so we can actually put a Header Bar

129
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.500
at the top of something, which is traditionally where Header Bars would be. They'll be at the top rather

130
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.500
than the bottom. However, wherever you do choose to put your Header Bars,

131
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.500
I wouldn't swap about too often. We tend to

132
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.500
focus on where things are, not necessarily what they look like or

133
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.500
what they've called. So if you go and move things about drastically, it can actually

134
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.500
slow your production down quite a bit, because you're then having to

135
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.500
relearn where things are. Now, we're going to focus on the

136
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.500
3D View, briefly, here, and I'm going to show you about the Tool Shelf, which is this

137
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.500
area that's opened up on the left-hand side here. And on the right-hand

138
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.500
side there is a Properties Panel. Now, we can resize those

139
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500
and may have to at any point. Of course, if you resize it and

140
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.500
make it too small it disappears. And there is a plus

141
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.500
and another plus on the top-left and right of any window

142
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.500
that's got these Tool Shelves and Properties Panels. So in

143
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.500
this particular case, I can make this bottom window larger and show

144
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.500
you, as well, with a UVImage Editor. I know that

145
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.500
that type of window actually has... Ooh, I missed a click there!

146
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.500
That particular window also has a plus at the top-left and right, which

147
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.500
means it's got a Tool Shelf and a Properties Panel devoted to it.

148
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.500
So we can click the pluses and make those appear.

149
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.500
So there we go, Tool Shelf on the left-hand side and the Properties

150
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.500
Panel on the right. There's also a keyboard shortcut to do that. And

151
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.500
with most keyboard shortcuts, they apply to the window that you're

152
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.500
current cursor is over. So for instance, the Tool Shelf, the shortcut

153
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.500
key is the Letter T. So if we go ahead and press T,

154
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.500
while we're over the UVImage Editor, you can see that it's enabling the Tool

155
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.500
Shelf on there. I'm just going to continue pressing T and move my cursor up to

156
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.500
this window. I haven't clicked on anything, it's just

157
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.500
where my cursor is, and a commong mistake is, you're trying to do an operation

158
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.500
and your cursor has drifted off the window you're working on. And of

159
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.500
course, the keys your pressing, and Blender is quite key heavy,

160
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.500
and you're not actually controlling the window you thought you were controlling.

161
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.500
Now the properties side, you can control that with the N.

162
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.500
Now, depending on the screen space you have, you can

163
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.500
obviously leave these open all the time. You'll find that I open and shut them quite

164
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.500
a bit, in order to give myself a bit more space, so I can show you guys what I'm doing.

165
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.500
Again, I'll try and minimize that as much as possible.

166
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.500
So now we've had a brief layout overview, I'd like you to just

167
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.500
play with it for a bit, so I've got a small challenge for you.

168
00:11:01.566 --> 00:11:05.200
OK guys, I'd like you to play with the layout!

169
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.200
Now, of course, what I'd like you to do here is just make your own layout. Move the

170
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.200
windows about, hide some Header Bars, just get you used to the general feeling

171
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.200
of what's going on. So alter it, change window types and sizes

172
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.200
and see how, how that all pans out. Now this may seem like a very

173
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.200
very simple task, if you've used these sort of applications before,

174
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.200
but it's great to just engrain that knowledge and make sure you have it absolutely

175
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.200
nailed. So pause the video and give that a go!

176
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.200
OK guys, welcome back!

177
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.200
So let's go and play with the layout over in Blender, to just give you an

178
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.200
idea of what we can do.

179
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.200
OK, so we're back over in Blender here, and so straight away we can play with

180
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.200
the size of windows. Now, depending, as I say, on the screen that

181
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.200
you've got, being able to take control and resize the windows that

182
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.200
you have in front of you or even hide certain parts of them

183
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.200
and to give yourself more space is a great boon! We really want to be able

184
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.200
to master this interface. We'll go over creating some new windows

185
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.200
in the next lecture, but in this one, I just want to take control and make

186
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.200
sure I've got, well make sure I have control over the basics.

187
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.200
So I can hide those Header Bars. Now, some of these Header Bars, of course, if you

188
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.200
hide them you just cause yourself more grief. But in some

189
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.200
cases, it's very easy to accidentally hide them, like you think you're moving

190
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.200
one of these up and down and you don't, you do that! It can also be very

191
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.200
confusing, of course, if it looks something like this where it looks like we've

192
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.200
just got the one window here with a 3D View and a 3D Header Bar.

193
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.200
Actually, it's a 3D View without a Header Bar and a 3D View without

194
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.200
a window, the actual 3D View itself. So that's one of those things

195
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.200
I have seen people have an issue with in the past.

196
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.966
It's great to make sure that you guys will not suffer the same fate

197
00:12:56.966 --> 00:12:59.933
if you accidentally hide your Header Bar there.

198
00:12:59.933 --> 00:13:03.933
OK brilliant! I hope you guys are getting the feel and control of Blender's

199
00:13:03.933 --> 00:13:07.933
layout! And in the next lecture, we'll be going through how to master it

200
00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:11.933
and do the advanced controls on this layout, as well. And when we've absolutely nailed

201
00:13:11.933 --> 00:13:15.600
the layout, we can start making some 3D models. So

202
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.666
congratulations guys! And

203
00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:20.166
I will see you in the next lecture!
