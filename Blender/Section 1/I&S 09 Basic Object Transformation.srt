00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,766
Welcome to Basic Object Transformation! Wow, that

2
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:07,766
sounds like a mouthful, don't worry it's relatively straight forward!

3
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:11,766
So let's go ahead and make something! So we're going to

4
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:15,766
learn here how to scale or resize, Blender calls

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:19,766
it resizing; Rotate and move or translate

6
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:23,766
objects. We'll also be learning how to constrain

7
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:27,766
those particular operations as well.

8
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:31,766
Speaking of operations, we're going to introduce you to the Operator Panel.

9
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:35,766
This is something that confuses people, especially when

10
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:39,766
you've not used Blender before, because it's kind of a phantom. It

11
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:43,766
disappears when you need it again, and I'll explain why and

12
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:47,766
what is happening. Understand the 3D Manipulator Widget.

13
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:51,766
We've already seen it, it's that white ball in the middle of the screen, with the multi-colored arrows coming

14
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:55,766
out of it. I'll explain more about that for you. And we're also

15
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:59,766
going to add objects to our scene, so we're going to be building with primitives.

16
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:03,399
So let's hop straight on over into Blender!

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,300
OK, so we're over in a Default blend file here,

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,300
and I would suggest, for the moment, that you watch what I'm doing and where I'm clicking,

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,300
so you can get a good grasp of all of the items. We've got

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,300
a lot to go through in this lecture, and I wouldn't

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,300
want you to miss anything as we go through. So we've got our

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,300
cube in the middle of our scene here, and we need to do something with it.

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,300
We need to make it smaller, we need to move it to another position, we need to put it

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,300
at a different angle. Now, we have some options

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,300
up on the top-left, on the Tool Shelf, for transforming.

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,300
That's great! We're doing transformation, that sounds great! So we've got Translate, Rotate,

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,300
and Scale. Those are the three most common things that you'll be doing

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,300
with objects, so we can Translate. What does Translate mean? It means

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,300
move. And we can right click to cancel the move,

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,300
or we could have left clicked to apply the move. Now you'll notice as you hover over

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,000
these, it actually tells us what the shortcut key is.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,833
It also tells us a bit more details, so Translate, it actually has

33
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,833
in brackets there "(Move) selected items". Rotate the shortcut

34
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,833
is R, so that's great! Translate, Rotate,

35
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,833
and Scale is S. So Scale is S and Rotate is R. That's

36
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,833
great, but Translate is G, so I think about that as Grabbing

37
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,833
your object. Grabbing it and moving it about your scene, so that's also

38
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,833
very powerful. So I can go here and I can hit the G key

39
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,833
and start moving things about. Now, remember that the keys that you press,

40
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,833
your cursor has to be over the appropriate window. Now the G key

41
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,833
might do something different, over another window, so

42
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,833
make sure your actual cursor is over the window before you start

43
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,833
pressing it, pressing the G key the R key or any other shortcut

44
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,833
key. So if we press the R key, we can move it about,

45
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,833
and the S key, we can scale it up and down.

46
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,833
Notice it doesn't go to nothingness, it actually flips inside out and comes

47
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,833
out the other way as well. Now that can cause you problems later on,

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,833
so if you want to scale up, make sure you don't push through yourself

49
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,833
and end up a negative. If I can draw your eyes to where the 3D Editor

50
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,833
Bar used to be, we can see that it says Scale X -2.4

51
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,833
etc., etc. and that is

52
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,833
what is happening there. So that's going the wrong way, let's go back this way and scale it upwards.

53
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,833
There you go! So I've scaled it upwards by roughly 3. Now in

54
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,833
the Operator panel, if you've been paying attention, in the lower-left

55
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,833
here, you might have caught that the Operator panel was changing,

56
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,833
depending on what I'd just done. So if I go ahead, I've resized it

57
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,833
here so it's big... Oh, by the way, if you adjust the size

58
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:49,833
of this and make it too small, you end up with another little plus icon,

59
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,833
within the Tool Shelf itself and that will bring up the Operator

60
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,833
panel. Once we're in the Operator panel, this is something that

61
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,833
confuses a lot of people. The moment you do something else, the

62
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,833
previous operation you've just done, whether it be moving, scaling, rotating,

63
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,833
or even undoing or selecting another item,

64
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,833
that will break the Operator panel. So if I go ahead and start

65
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,833
moving the Camera, for instance... So I'm going to ue the 3D Manipulator

66
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,833
Widget to move this and left click on...

67
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,833
Ah look at that, we can actually move things up and down in the Z

68
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,833
direction, that's very powerful. But the moment I've done that, I've lost the ability

69
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,833
of the Transform, in this case the Scale that we'd done to the

70
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,833
cube. There's no going back! That's important! Once you've moved

71
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,833
on there is no going back to the Operator panel. So let's say

72
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:45,833
I had resized that to that amount; we've got an option here and

73
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,833
look, we've got a way of constraining. So the Vector is the change, so if

74
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,833
I resized it in the X direction I can change

75
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,833
that. Ah look at that! We can make different shapes, very very powerful!

76
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,833
We can also have that constrained while we're scaling.

77
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,833
If I hit S and Scale and decide that I want to

78
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,833
constrain it on one of the axis, I can press X,

79
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,833
and there we go, we're making it longer and shorter in the X axis. I can press Y

80
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,833
here, make it longer and shorter in the Y axis, and the same with Z. So Z

81
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,833
is up, in this case, and we can see it's going up and back down again,

82
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,833
making it thinner. Now, when you're doing movements like this,

83
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,833
sometimes it moves too much, so let's hit S

84
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,833
again and go Z, so we're locking it to the Z axis. And

85
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,833
say that's just moving far too much, what we can do at this point is

86
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,833
just hold the Shift key down and that enables us to move

87
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,833
much more slowly and have greater control.

88
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:49,833
That Shift key, by the way, works if we go over to let's say the Operator

89
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,833
panel here. We've got a slider here, we can click on Z and slide it up and

90
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,833
down, and we can also hold down Shift and slide it up and down

91
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,833
much slower or we can just type a number in there,

92
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,833
which is very very powerful. In fact, we can not only type a number in there,

93
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,833
but I can type 1 + 5 + 7.2

94
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,833
or something like that in there, and it will add those up for us.

95
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:17,833
We can actually type equations into there, which is brilliant! You sometimes have

96
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,833
to know how to give Blender equations, but if it's just simple multiplation or

97
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:25,833
division, you can type it straight into any of these number fields that we can see.

98
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,766


99
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,766
So we've already mentioned the 3D Manipulator Widget.

100
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:33,766
On the Header Bar itself, for the 3D Editor

101
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,766
Header, you can turn the 3D Widget off and on.

102
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:41,766
You can also change what it does. So at the moment it sets to the arrow,

103
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:45,766
which means Translate. OK, and then we can

104
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:49,766
Rotate and we can Scale and

105
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:53,766
we can select either one. And if we've got it on Rotate,

106
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:57,766
we can left click on that and rotate it around. Now I

107
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:01,766
will use a mixture of the 3D Manipulator

108
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:05,766
Widget or I will use the keyboard shortcuts, that's my

109
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,766
general use. So I'm just going to scale that back down now, so it's a bit smaller.

110
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:13,766
And something that we've learned previously, I'm going to hit the Numpad for

111
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,766
stop and just zoom in on that selected object, so we can

112
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:21,766
see what we're working on. Now the final thing, of course, is

113
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:25,766
adding some additional objects to our scene. OK, how do we do that?

114
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:29,766
Well we're going to look for something called Add, and if we go down to the

115
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:33,766
3D Editor Header, we can see there's an Add menu. If we hover over

116
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:37,766
it, it gives us a bit more information, and we can see that it's a shortcut Shift and A.

117
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:41,766
And Shift and A will bring up this menu but underneath

118
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:45,766
your cursor in the 3D Editor. So I'm going to go Shift and A,

119
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:49,766
and we've got plenty of things that we can add. At the moment,

120
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:53,766
I just want you to focus on Mesh. So let's

121
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:57,766
say we want to add a, I don't know, a Cone or a Cylinder,

122
00:07:57,766 --> 00:08:01,766
we can go ahead and select one. Well where has it appeared? Well

123
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:05,766
it looks like it's appeared down there, but because that's now the selected object, I

124
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:09,766
can press the Numpad full stop and focuse on it.

125
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:13,766
Now, that particular object, that we've just created, has

126
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:17,766
appeared where the 3D Cursor was. So if the 3D Cursor had been

127
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:21,766
moved at any point, it would appear there. Now if you

128
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:25,766
have a look at the Operator panel, we will see that we've got some control

129
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:29,766
over that primitive, that basic shape that we've just added to

130
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:33,332
our scene. This control only exists for this

131
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:33,566


132
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:37,566
moment in time. If we do anything else or start doing anything

133
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:41,566
else in our scene, we would lose the ability to change these

134
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:45,566
items down here. So we can see that the number of vertices... Let's just see what that does!

135
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,566
Let's move it to the left and right. OK, it changes how...

136
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:53,566
Oh, at it's smallest point, 3, we've got ourselves a pyramid.

137
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,566
OK, and then as we increase it the base gets more and more circular.

138
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:01,566
OK that's powerful! What else can we do? Oh, we can make it not a complete cone, so it looks

139
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:05,566
like we've got a Radius of 1 across the bottom, and a Radius of

140
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:09,566
2 at the top. I'm presuming that's made that larger. Yes!

141
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:13,566
There we go! How cool is that? A Depth! Well what does the Depth do?

142
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:17,566
I encourage you guys to play with this! You know, at this early stage you're not

143
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:21,566
going to break anything. Play with it, see what you get from it, and we

144
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:25,566
won't go into details about what the rest of this means at this moment

145
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,566
in time, that's something for another lecture. But you can see that you've got lots

146
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:33,566
of control. If we go ahead and straight away add another object,

147
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:37,566
let's add a UV Sphere. And we've got options here

148
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:41,566
that we can change, but of course, once we've actually done

149
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:45,566
that, there is no going back! So if I decide to use the 3D

150
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:49,566
Manipulator Widget, on its Moving function, and

151
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:53,566
left click on that arrow and move it out of the way, I can't now go back and

152
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:57,566
change any of the settings I had had on that particular

153
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:01,566
UV Sphere. It's now stuck like that! If I wanted to change the number of

154
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:05,566
segments or rings that it has, I would have to create a new object.

155
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:06,332


156
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,733
Hey guys! So this is the end of

157
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,733
section challenge! It's going to be a bit of a bigger challenge than the ones you've

158
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,733
had so far, but don't worry, it's nice and straightforward.

159
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:20,733
I'd like you to add into your scene a cube,

160
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:24,733
a cylinder, and a cone.

161
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:28,733
Now, place these on top of one another, have fun with this. They don't have to be

162
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:32,733
exactly butted up against one another. You can put them

163
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,733
inside one another, if you'd like. Just play with it, make some funky shapes.

164
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:40,733
If you guys want to add something else, other than a cube, a cylinder, or a cone

165
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:44,733
by all means make a toy castle out of cubes

166
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:48,733
that you've squished together, and the towers and the turrets can

167
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:52,733
be made out of cylinders. You can have lots of fun, as if these were little wooden blocks

168
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:56,733
that children play with. It's amazing what you can come up with!

169
00:10:56,733 --> 00:11:00,733
And I'd like you to then create 4 3D Editor

170
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:04,733
windows. So using the knowledge that you gained earlier

171
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:08,733
on in the course, I'd like you to create the 4 3D Editor windows and

172
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,733
change them to a certain view type. I'd like a Perspective,

173
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:16,733
it doesn't matter where it's looking. I'd like an Orthographic projection.

174
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:20,733
I would like a Front view and a Top view.

175
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:24,733
Now in tradition, usually the Front and Top views

176
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:28,733
would be an Orthographic projection but it doesn't matter. But if you

177
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:32,733
want to make them traditional, I suppose, make the Front and top Orthographic

178
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,733
as well. Remember to take a screenshot

179
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:40,733
and share it with us! I love seeing your work, and I'm looking forward

180
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,733
to seeing what you guys come up with, just by using these basic building

181
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:48,733
blocks! So pause the video and give that a go!

182
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:49,866


183
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:52,932
OK, so I'm going to stick rigidly to the challenge that

184
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:56,933
I set here. So I'm going to create a new Blender file, so I can get

185
00:11:56,933 --> 00:12:00,933
rid of everything that's going on there. So I've got a cube,

186
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,933
a cylinder, and a cone! OK, and I'm going to stack them top of one another!

187
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,933
So I've got the cube there, so I need to add. So Add!

188
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:12,933
It's going to be a Mesh and

189
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,933
Cylander. OK, so that's inside the other one just there.

190
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,933
I think I'm going to use the 3D Manipulator Widget and just pull it up.

191
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:24,933
OK. Now, I can align my

192
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:28,933
view. Of course, I can look at it from the side, in Orthographic

193
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:32,933
view. There we go, I can get a better control of how to align things up there. It's not

194
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:36,933
going to be perfect but it doesn't have to be at this stage, so don't worry about that.

195
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:40,933
OK, so what was the other one? A cone! So let's add.

196
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:44,933
I'm going to use those keyboard shortcuts this time, and Mesh

197
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:48,933
and Cone. OK brilliant! And that is also is appearing

198
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:52,933
on the... Oh, you know what we could do! I'm going to undo the ADD,

199
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:56,933
of that cylinder. I'm going to go ahead and click on the...

200
00:12:56,933 --> 00:13:00,933
Oh, I haven't undone that! Oh, there we go! So I'm going to click on the surface

201
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:04,933
of my sphere ,

202
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,933
...cube

203
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:12,933
...and from that... Oh, that's not quite lined up unfortunately!

204
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:16,933
Let's look at it from the top. OK that's good! So if I

205
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,933
click there, that's roughly in the middle. That might be good enough! Let's go ahead and

206
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,933
Add a Cylinder. Now I'm going to click again

207
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:28,933
on the top, roughly in the middle, and add a

208
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,933
Cone! Oh cool! OK, they're in one another,

209
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:36,933
so the origin was the middle of that. That's good,

210
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:40,933
I'm getting this. Let's move this up and move this one up,

211
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:44,933
and we've got ourselves somewhat, it looks like a tower or a lighthouse.

212
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:48,933
In fact, I'm going to do some scaling here. Let's scale this one

213
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:52,933
in and then move it back down again. And again, looking at it from the side

214
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:56,933
it helps align things up. Remember you can do that.

215
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:00,933
I'm liking that! I'm going to make my square base just a little bigger,

216
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:04,933
or cube base a little bigger, I'm just going to scale it up. There

217
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:08,933
we go! That's all sitting on there really nicely! So I'm going to hide my Tool

218
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:12,933
Shelf, so it's nice and neat, and I'm going to split the window in

219
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:16,933
two. And then, going to spit each one of these windows

220
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:20,933
there, and I'm going to hide the Toolbar so it's

221
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:24,933
nice and clean. There we go there! There, there, and

222
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:28,933
there! OK, all the header bars, and now we just need to

223
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,933
change the scene. So one of them needs to be Perspective. Done!

224
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:36,933
And then, one of them needs to be the Front, and one of them

225
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,433
the side or the Top. I can't remember my own challenge! Yes, it's

226
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,166


227
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:45,166
the Top! So there we go! We've got ourselves... Oh, I've moved the 3D

228
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:49,166
View. We've got ourselves 4 different views of a cone,

229
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:53,166
a cylinder, and a cube, stacked on top of one another.

230
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:57,166
How did you guys get on? Did you make something from this? Did you make a castle?

231
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:01,166
Did you make a lighthouse? Did you make a house out of something like this?

232
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:01,299


233
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,133
Make sure you've shared with us, so we can see how you're getting on.

234
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,933
I love seeing what you guys come up with,

235
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:11,899
and I will see you guys in the next lecture!
