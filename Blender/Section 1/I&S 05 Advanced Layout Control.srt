00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,833
Welcome to Advanced Layout

2
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:05,833
Control! In this video you will re-enforce

3
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:09,833
your layout behavior. How to effortlessly switch

4
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:13,833
between layouts. How to use Blender on two screens, so if you've got two

5
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,833
or more screens you can actually move Blender onto those and have an even

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,833
bigger and better interface. Lots more control you can have that. We're going to

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,900
learn some of the shortcuts for the editor types as well. So let's hop straight on

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,000
over into Blender!

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So,  just had a funny quirk happen to me a few moments

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
ago, where I went to File and New and my

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
layout went all funny. It went like this. If that does happen to you, because

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Layout, Blender's layout can become a bit distorted like this

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
occasionally, what I tend to do is I tend to grab the window, and you can see then it

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
resets itself. And then I can just go ahead and make it full

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
screen again. So that's one of the ways of getting around, one of those quirks that tends to

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
happen. OK, so some more advanced control! I will

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
teach you guys how to make new windows and how to remove ones that you don't

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
want. So the first thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to hit the little plus button

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and create my layout. I'm going to change this layout

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
there, so that what we do now is not going to

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
destroy the Default layout. Of course, if you do destroy the Default layout,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
then I'll teach you the skills to get back to it as well. So what

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I would like you to do first of all is just watch me, because I'm going

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to be clicking again on areas that are quite small, on the screen, so

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you can see where my cursor is going. And then, I'll give you the opportunity, during the challenge,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to test the knowledge that you've just learned. So first of all,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
let's go ahead and create another one of these 3D windows,

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and we can do that by the little hashes that are in the top-right and the

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
bottom-left of every editor window. If we have a look at

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the Info Header, and literally it's tiny,

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's this little area at the top here. But we've got a hashed area there

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
on the lower-left and we've got a hashed area all the way on the upper-right as well.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And that enables us to click with the left mouse button and

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
drag it to create a new window. I'm not going to do it to the tiny area up there

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
but I'm going to do it to this 3D Editor window now. Now because the hash

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
area that we're just about to drag on belongs to the 3D

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Editor window, we can tell that because the triangle's in the top

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
corner or the bottom corner. When we click and drag, that

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
is the window that we'll duplicate, including as to whether or not it's got its Tool

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Shelf open on the left-hand side here or whether it's not.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now, that gives us an opportunity to generate a lot of

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
windows in our scene. And I've seen people go, that try

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to move it left and right and they've accidentally grabbed this area here, and they go, oh

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
no I don't, I don't want that! How do I?! Oh no, what's going on?! [Laughs] You can very

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
quickly end up with quite a messy interface. Now, there are two

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
important rules, when it comes to collapsing the windows on top of one

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
another. For a start, you can only collapse, If you're using

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
this top widget you can only collapse, um first of all,

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
to areas that are of the same shape. So

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
if I try and collapse this big window here down to where these two small

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
windows have appeared that just won't work. I'll need these two smaller windows

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
to first be a larger window, before I can do anything with that.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So in order to collapse these, what I would do is I'd pick the

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
bottom one and push it up or the right-hand side and push it to the

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
right, if I was using this top Splitter Widget.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's what they're called. If I'm using the bottom one, then I can

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
push down or to the left. Of course, I can't push to the left, in this case,

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
becausee it's not the same size. So let's use

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the top ones, at the moment. I tend to go for the top ones because they're easier to get your hands

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
on or your cursor on. If I go ahead and click on

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that... I've just opened up another window, I didn't mean to do that

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
unfortunately but that is easy to do. And this just shows you how

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
fragile, I supposed the actual layout can be, if you're not

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
paying full 100% attention. So now that I've done this,

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going to have to click on again this Splitter Widget. I'm going to be

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
very precise this time and move it across to the right, to overcome

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the one on the right. And I'm going to do the same here,

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm going to pick this one after... Again, it's very easy to do! I'm going to pick this

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
one up here and pull it up, and you can see that an arrow appears when I do

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that and that shows you the direction of overwriting.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Now, what I'm going to do here, just to demonstrate, is I'm going to turn one of these views

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to something different like a Dope Sheet, let's say. So we've got

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
this Dope Sheet in the middle of two 3D views. Now what I can do,

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
in order to make this Dope Sheet appear on this half of our screen,

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
is go ahead and click on the Splitter Widget and move it over,

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and we can see that, that is going to overwrite the one on the

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
right. OK, now, on, if we

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
want it to go to the left we've got a couple of options. We can click the Splitter Widget down

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
here and move it on the lower-left and move it to the left, or we could do

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the upper-right. Oh, I've done it again! It's so easy to

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
do! So don't worry guys if you end up doing this, because click and move over to the right

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and we can see here that nice big arrow, which tells us which way we're going to be overwriting.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
However, with the Left Mouse Button still clicked

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
still pressed down, I can now move the arrow to the other way.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And we can see that the screen flips

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and we're going to overwrite the 3D View with the Dope Sheet.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Very powerful, enables us to go backwards and forwards and

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
use either one, and I switched back there to the 3D View.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So one of the other things that you can do as well is customize the Header Bars.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So we've already learned that you can hide them out of the way, which is

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
a little bit irritating, if you do it accidentally and click the plus to bring it

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
back again. But we can customize it, we can right-click on it and flip it to the top,

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
right-click on it and flip it to the bottom. And I

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
would recommend not changing the layout until

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
you know what you really want to do with it. It might be conceptually

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
good for you to go, well the Header Bar should be at the top of the

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
screen. But of course, if you move all your Header Bars to the top of the screen,

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I am not going to do that. You may struggle to follow along if I keep

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
saying, if you now go down to the Header Bar, because I'm going to assume throughout

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the course that you don't change your layout to

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
much. I'm going to stay with the standard layout through most of this course and

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
only make changes where I need them. So for instance, if I'm struggling to

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
fit something on the screen, I may make a change that you don't have to follow, it's

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
just so I can see what's going on. One of the other great things that

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you can do, if you've got more than one monitor, is you can

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
duplicate the entire window in front of you and create another

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
window that you can work on. And you do that through the Window menu on

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the Info . So if we go ahead and click on Window

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and go to Duplicate Window, and we can see there's a shortcut key there, Control

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Alt and W. Now, most of the options in Blender do

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
have shortcut keys, and Blender is incredibly shortcut key

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
heavy. And in a few lectures time, we'll be going over those shortcuts because they do

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
vary a little from system to system. So I'm going to go ahead here and duplicate

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the window. Now it's going to look like nothing has happened, and

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that's because the duplicate window is on top of the one we're working on. So what

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
we're going to do here is just move one of these windows and fill up the right-hand

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
side of the screen and one to fill up the left. Now what we notice here is

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
both of these were on the, My Layout, the layout I created first

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
of all, but you can see that the moment I've duplicated the window, we've got

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
this My Layout.001. And that basically means

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
that I've created a new layout as well by doing that. They obviously

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
can't share the same... Well they can share the same layout, but that means if I

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
adjust one it will adjust the other, and that's kind of not the point, when you want a

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
duplicate window. You'll often want a full screen, let's say of you working with

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
two monitors. You might want a full screen render happening, or you

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
might want a full screen 3D editor

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
on all the time, so you can do all your modeling in one screen and all of your options

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,833
on another. It's very powerful!

129
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,600
One of the things to bear in mind here is, when you start collapsing

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600
these down, then you want to get rid of it, if I went ahead...

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
And we can see it's blatantly obvious, at this point in time, that this one says

132
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
My Layout and this one says My Layout.001, so we know which one is the

133
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,600
master so to speak and which one the duplicate came from. If I

134
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
go and click on this drop-down for these view selection

135
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
and change one to Default and

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,766
one to Animation, that's great! But I now don't

137
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,066
know which one's which, I could even shuffle them.

138
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:58,333
OK, so now that we don't know which one's

139
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,333
which, if I went and shut down the master or tried to shut down the master,

140
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,333
ah! So which one was the master there? It's obviously this one on

141
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:10,333
the left. If I go ahead and create a new duplicate window

142
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,333
and try and shut down the master, we get this warning

143
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:18,333
message. So do you want to exit Blender? Well no I don't.

144
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:22,333
I'm demonstrating stuff at the moment, so I'm going to click Cancel. But I know now that

145
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,333
this is not the master, it is kind of the slave I

146
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:30,333
suppose, and we can click on the cross there and get rid of it. Going to make this one full

147
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,333
screen again. Now one of the things to bear in mind, when you start doing that duplication,

148
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,333
is this can start to get a bit cluttered. So we've got Default.001.

149
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,333
Now if you happen to be in a window,

150
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:46,333
and that was the one that you duplicated to make another window, we would

151
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,333
very quickly end up with Default.001, Default.002,

152
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,333
and if that perpeturated, we'd end up with a lot of clutter

153
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,333
in that menu system. Oh, and Default.002

154
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:02,333
is actually the master in this case, so let's close down the one that's not.

155
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:06,333
OK, so how do we get rid of this. Well there's a cross there, and if we do that we

156
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:10,333
can delete the active screen. So we've got a series of options here,

157
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,333
Default.002, delete the active scene, delete the active scene. I

158
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,333
don't need those and I don't want them to clutter up here. My Layout.001,

159
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:22,333
I'm going to delete that because it is identical to My Layout, and having

160
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,333
it in duplicates all over the place is going to be a pain. OK,

161
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,333
so now we've mastered more advanced layout techniques and moving things about.

162
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:34,333
There's just one final thing and that's the shortcut keys for

163
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,333
the actual changing of the screens. So we can go ahead, straight

164
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,333
away, and hold down Shift and use the F number along the top of the keyboard.

165
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:46,333
Now if you're running a Mac or Linux, you may find that this also

166
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,333
activates some system keys, but let's just go see what happens. So Shift and F1

167
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,333
gives us the File menu. We can see up here

168
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:58,333
it's changed it to the File Browser, that's what it's called here. Shift and F2

169
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:02,333
changes it to a different one, and Shift and F3, Shift and F4, etc.

170
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:06,333
etc. Shift and F5 is the 3D View. Now all of these, when

171
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,333
you go to them, they go full screen apart from the Info Header at the

172
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:14,333
top, which is very powerful, and there is a button to go back to

173
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,333
previous. And it'll take us back to the previous one, of course, because I've been

174
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,333
playing about. It's not taking us back to the 3D View, because we've iterated

175
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:26,333
it through, so I'll need to go back down here to the Header Bar for this

176
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,333
particular window and change it back to the 3D View. Now if I keep going

177
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,333
along there, so we were on Shift and F5, Shift F6, Shift F7, Shift F8.

178
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,333
You can see it's going through them. There's the Outliner. There's the

179
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:42,333
UV Image Editor. Ah, so Shift and F11,

180
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,333
if it did control anything, is actually controlling something else

181
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,333
to do with Blender. So it is important... Sorry, something else

182
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,333
to do with the operating system itself and not Blender. So it's

183
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:58,333
worthwhile bearing those particular ones in mind. Now I

184
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,300
don't use those shortcut key. I generally

185
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,033
go down to the icon itself and select the one that

186
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:09,033
I want, primarily I suppose, to make sure you guys can see what I'm

187
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:13,033
actively doing, rather than just randomly hitting shortcut keys all the time.

188
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:17,033
But feel free to learn those shortcut keys, so you can quickly

189
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,733
flip between different screens. And with

190
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,833
all that knowledge, I've got a layout challenge for you!

191
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,966
I would like you to get back to the Default Layout.

192
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,966
So go ahead and open up the LayoutMess.blend

193
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:34,966
from your resources. Now, if you haven't downloaded your resources yet,

194
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:38,966
remember they're against the talking heads at the beginning of every

195
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,966
section. And we put them there so they are not against any

196
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:46,966
specific video, so you can get them all at once. It's great if you need to work

197
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,966
offline at any point, then you've got all of the resources together. So make sure you've opened

198
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:54,966
it up. Now this itself is a ruined workspace,

199
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:58,966
which I would like you to get back to the Default layout.

200
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:02,966
And remember, I'd like you to also share your success. This not

201
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:06,966
only helps me know that you guys are understanding what

202
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:10,966
you're learning, but it also is wonderful to see you

203
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:14,966
progress. So please make sure, after you completed the challenge and any other,

204
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,500
that you share your work so we can all see how we're doing.

205
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,300
So pause the video now and give that a go!

206
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,300
OK guys

207
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,300
welcome back! Let's go and open up this layout mess and see how it looks!

208
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,533
OK so first of all, I would just like to say that I have

209
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:38,533
extracted the Section 1 Assets into their own folder.

210
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:42,533
I've named it in my documents file system here. I've named it in documents

211
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:46,533
Section 1, LayoutMess. Now what I would like you guys to do

212
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:50,533
is make sure you don't end up being a bit messy with your

213
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:54,533
file system. Now later, at the moment, it really

214
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,533
doesn't matter that much, but it's very good to engrain

215
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:02,533
the habit of good file structure and good naming. So

216
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:06,533
be aware of that from now onwards, because

217
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:10,533
later on, it's going to become critical that things are stored in an

218
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:14,533
appropriate place and are named appropriately as well.

219
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:18,533
Otherwise it can be very confusing and things can start to break and fall

220
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,500
apart and we don't want that.

221
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,933
So let's go ahead and open up LayoutMess!

222
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:27,933
OK wow! OK, so we've got

223
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,933
a bit of a LayoutMess here! Now, there are going to be two ways of solving this problem.

224
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Now, if I haven't changed the Default screen

225
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,100
layout, I should be able to get back to it through the Info

226
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Header. I'm not sure whether I've done that, Mm, so let's go and

227
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,966
work with that first of all.

228
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,033
So let's go and change this

229
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:52,033
type to an Info Header, and change it from

230
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:56,033
My Layout to Default. Bingo! OK,

231
00:14:56,033 --> 00:15:00,033
so if you went through that way, well done, kudos for you being able

232
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:04,033
to think ahead and go, well if Mike left the Default layout I should

233
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:08,033
be able to get back at that, to it that way. But let's presume that

234
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,900
I had overwritten it, which is entirely possible.

235
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,533
So I'm going to go to File and Revert. That's

236
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:19,533
going to take us back to the previous state the file was in.

237
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:23,533
So what can we do here? Well there are a couple of ways

238
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:27,533
of approaching this. You can get the layout roughly right and then change all the window

239
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:31,533
types and that's what I'm going to do, rather than doing it individually at the time.

240
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:35,533
So I'm going to, first of all, I'm going to move this

241
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:39,533
one out and then down, and that will give us the...

242
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:43,533
What was it? This is Outliner and this was

243
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:47,533
Properties. So that one's fine, that one's sorted over there. This one here, well

244
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:51,533
there's an Info Bar at the top, and then, there was a

245
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:55,533
Timeline at the bottom, so let's put a Timeline there. And

246
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:59,533
this was a 3D View. 3D View has a header

247
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:03,533
down at the bottom. OK, so I'm going to right-click here and Flip to the Top

248
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:07,533
there. So the Outliner's now looking like it looked before, and of course, the

249
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,533
cube would be somewhere in our scene, looking kind of like that.

250
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,100
That I think it looks like normally!

251
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,100
OK, so we saw there that there were actually two ways in

252
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,100
which to accomplish this challenge, and you'll find that that comes up

253
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,100
a lot when we're going through Blender. There will always be more than

254
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,100
one way of accomplishing the task, especially when it comes to modeling.

255
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Now there are often efficient ways of working or different ways of working,

256
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,100
and sometimes I will do something to demonstrate the lesson we've just learned.

257
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,100
But of course, if you know another way of doing it, as long as you get to the same

258
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,100
end result, and you're aware of the other way of doing it as well, that's a

259
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,100
great way to progress. It shows that you guys are thinking

260
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,100
outside of the box, going beyond of what I've taught you as well, and being

261
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,100
able to apply all of your knowledge, so that's brilliant! Remember, of course,

262
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,100
I'd like to share your work, so that we can all join in and

263
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,100
see what's going on. It's brilliant for myself, I see you guys

264
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,100
progressing. It's a great sense of achievement all around. And of course,

265
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,033
I will see you guys now in the next lecture!
