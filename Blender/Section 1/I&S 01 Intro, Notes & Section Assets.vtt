Hey guys, and welcome to the Complete Blender

2
00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.833
Creator! My name's Ben! And I'm Michael! And together we are really excited,

3
00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:10.833
because we get to see how you change as you progress through this course!

4
00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:14.833
You can go from 0 skills to really quite a capable artist, pretty quickly!

5
00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:18.833
So who's going to be the main instructor on the course, Mikey?! I am! OK,

6
00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:22.833
so Ben's going, I'm going to be your main instructor, guiding you through most of the changes we're

7
00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:26.833
experiencing in Blender, and Ben here, he's really in the background helping support. And he will

8
00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:30.833
pop into the occasional lectures. I know we've got a couple on Unity, coming up

9
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:34.833
as well. So he's going to be there as support to make sure that the learning journey for you

10
00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:38.833
guys is great! Absolutely! So, attached to this lecture, you've

11
00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:42.833
got a link over to Google Slides. That's where you want to go to get the latest section

12
00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:46.833
notes. They're always going to tell you what's coming up on the video, the details of your challenge,

13
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:50.833
and there'll be several diagrams and useful features in there. So go over there, it's a fully

14
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.833
intractable document, right, Mikey? Yep, that's great, and immediate feedback is what

15
00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:58.833
So if you spot a typo do let us know, and we can fix that for you! And also,

16
00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:02.833
attached to this particular lecture we have your assets, so anything that you're going

17
00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.833

18
00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.833
handy on your computer. Absolutely! So to end this off, we're going to switch into a screen

19
00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:14.433
class, where Mikey has got a challenge for you!

20
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.733
OK guys, it's challenge time! I'd like you to go ahead and say

21
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.733
hello! So post a comment against this lecture.

22
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:26.733
Introduce yourself to the community. Let us know what your

23
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:30.733
goals are and ambitions are. Have a

24
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:34.733
look at some of the other students. Say hello to them, see if they've got similar

25
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:38.733
interests to yourself. It's a great way to meetup with other people who want

26
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:42.733
to use Blender and have the same style as you. Perhaps you're looking for an artist to work with,

27
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:46.733
well this might be an absolutely wonderful opportunity to do so!

28
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:50.733
Now, remember to come back here to meet new faces! You will obviously

29
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:54.733
have to come back to this particular lecture and have a look over there.

30
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:58.733
Of course, we've got the Facebook group as well, if you want to pop over there and join

31
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:02.733
that. So pause the video now, and give that a go!

32
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:06.733
OK guys, welcome back!

33
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:10.733
I hope you have said hello over in the discussions, it is

34
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:14.733
important! With all of these challenges, you will find most of the lectures that I

35
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:18.733
give to you guys will have a challenge, either a small or a big

36
00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:22.733
challenge in them. And it is really important that we engrain the habit now, that you go

37
00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:26.733
ahead and do these challenges. They're really important, they help cement the knowledge

38
00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:30.733
in your mind. And in this particular one it makes sure that you know how

39
00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:34.733
to, for instance, ask questions as well, because it is the same interface.

40
00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.866
So with that said, welcome to the course

41
00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:41.866
guys! Let's carry on now, and I will see you guys in the next lecture!
