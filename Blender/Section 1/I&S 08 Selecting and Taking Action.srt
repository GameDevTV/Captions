00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Welcome to Selecting

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,100
and Taking Action! In this video you'll understand what the

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,100
Right Mouse Button does. You'll understand what the Left

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,100
Mouse Button does. Why this is different from other

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,100
3D programs or probably most programs that you've used

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,100
on a computer before. We'll go through the differences there and

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,100
why it happens like that. I'll show you how to change it as well,

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,100
but I would recommend not changing it for

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,100
the one reason that, I will be giving you instructions during

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,100
the course and you'll have to reverse them in your head, which can be difficult

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,100
to follow, if you do decide to change it and I wouldn't recommend doing so.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,100
So let's hop on over into Blender and explore the Left and Right

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,333
Mouse Buttons.

14
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,333
OK, so we're over

15
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:53,333
in a Default Blend file, so we've got the standard cube in the scene.

16
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,333
Now, what I'm going to do here is, I'm just going to expand

17
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,333
these two windows on the right-hand side here, and also

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:05,333
just bring this one down as well. This area on the top-

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,333
right is called the outliner, and we can see

20
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:13,333
that we have three objects in our scene. So we've got the scene

21
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:17,333
here and underneath it we've got some parameters with how it renders in the

22
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,333
world, and then, we have three objects in our scene,

23
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:25,333
a Camera, a Cube, and a Lamp. And we can

24
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,266
select them from this Outliner as well. Notice

25
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:31,666
that the Cube currently has a orange border around

26
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,666
it and it does in the outliner as well.

27
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,666
If we go ahead and select the Camera, in this case, I

28
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,666
can use the Left Mouse Button. It's only selecting in the 3D Viewport

29
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,666
that it's the Right Mouse Button. So now I can see that

30
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:51,666
the Camera's selected, and it has been highlighted orange. When I want to

31
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:55,666
select more than one thing, I will hold down Shift whilst I'm selecting.

32
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,666
So now I can select the Cube, and I can go ahead and select the Lamp

33
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,666
and now all three objects are selected. You can see that two are

34
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,666
darker orange and one is a lighter orange, and that

35
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:11,666
is called the Active Item. So this is the Active Object,

36
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,666
the other ones are just selected. Now, that does give us some

37
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,666
control, it means we can do things to multiple objects at once.

38
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,666
Now, when you're first using Blender it is

39
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:27,666
very tempting to use the Left Mouse Button to select, [Laughs] like you do

40
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:31,666
in pretty much every other program. It takes a while to get used to

41
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,666
and I would suggest leaving it as that setting, because

42
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,666
otherwise it can get a bit difficult later on, and I'll show you why

43
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,666
now. So the Left Mouse Button moves what we call the

44
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:47,666
3D Cursor. So you can see I'm left clicking over the screen here,

45
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,666
and this 3D Cursor, this kind of target, this reticle here,

46
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,666
is just moving about, it's not doing anything else and I'll explain more

47
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,666
about that in a few moments. So with the Right Mouse Button,

48
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,666
if I go ahead and select my Cube or my Lamp or my Camera, it doesn't matter

49
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,666
which, and with the Right Mouse Button start moving it around,

50
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,666
once I've started moving I can let go of the Right Mouse Button. And you can

51
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,666
see, I'm just moving around randomly in space. Now,

52
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,666
if I want to put that somewhere, I can left click

53
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,666
and it will stay in that new location. So the

54
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,666
Right Mouse Button is Selection and

55
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,666
probably doing an action as well, and the Left Mouse Button

56
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,666
is to apply the action. Now that is really powerful because

57
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,666
that means it separates it, moving something, with applying

58
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:43,666
that move. So if I move that around again, but this time right click,

59
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,666
I can reset what I was doing and give it a go. Oh, I've moved the wrong

60
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,666
thing! Ah! Now, if you want to move it back to it's previously

61
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,666
location and you didn't know what the previous location was, we're probably all

62
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,666
used to, by now, systems having an Undo function.

63
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,666
Now you can get to the Undo function down on Object, and we

64
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:07,666
can see it's right at the bottom here. We've got Undo, so on the Mac it's

65
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,666
Command Z and on the PC it'd be Control and Z, just like it is on most

66
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,666
systems and then we've got Redo. Now Redo's slightly different, it's

67
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,666
Shift Command Z or Shift Control Z, and then, we've got an

68
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,666
Undo History as well. So if I look at the Undo History, we can see if we've got the original starter

69
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,666
here, and we've got a series of things that I've done and you can see that

70
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,666
we can drop back to any point in that history. Now that history,

71
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,666
by default, is pretty short, and we

72
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,666
want to make sure we've got enough undo points. If you need to undo lots

73
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,666
and lots and lots and lots, you should've probably saved in between doing your work.

74
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,666
So let's go and up the level of undo and make sure it's as high

75
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,666
as it can possibly be. So I'd like you to go to the File

76
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,666
and then go down to User Preferences. And once we have a look at the

77
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,033
User Preferences, we need to find the Undo levels and

78
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,600
that is over on the Edit tab.

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
And we can see here we've got a Global Undo, and we've

80
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
got 32 Steps. Well yes that conserves

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
memory, the number of steps is smaller, but what we can

82
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
also do here is just turn that all the way up to 256.

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
So if you've got a system with limited memory, you may actually

84
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
struggle with large Undo Steps, because obviously it's certainly not

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
at this beginning stage when we're just playing with basic objects, but later on,

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
you may struggler with more complicated scenes, having

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,600
such high steps. But in this case, I'm going to whack mine all the way up to 256,

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
and that gives me a very big buffer to go up. I'm going to leave

89
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
the Memory Limit at 0, because that means it doesn't have a limit.

90
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Of course, you can increase the level of steps to 256,

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
and then, say I want a Memory Limit of 128 megs or something

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
along those lines. So that's entirely up to you but I'm not going to change it, I'm going to leave

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
it at 0. I'm going to now Save User Settings,

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
to make sure that applies to every other Blend file that I work on,

95
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
and I'm just going to close the User Properties down again.

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Now, if you want to go ahead

97
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
and change the Left and Right Mouse Buttons,

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
again I don't suggest you do for several reasons. The primary one actually,

99
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
is if I am doing work and I'm giving you specific instructions,

100
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
you're going to have to transpose left and right in your head,

101
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
as well as the other combination of action and

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
applying that action will no longer exist. But under the User Preferences,

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
under Input, you can go to the Select With and change

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Left to Right. Now, I know I've said this before about the User Preferences, but do be careful

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,600
in here. Remember you can always reset it, but you can also

106
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
make Blender quite odd, so do make sure

107
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
that you make a note of the things you change, if you're going to test

108
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,600
them. In fact, if you are going to test them, turn them on but

109
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,600
do not save, see if it works. If it doesn't work,

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,600
you can always come in and turn it back off again, or the next time you use Blender,

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,600
it will go back to its default settings or the settings you've currently stored.

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,600
So I'm not going to change that around, I like using the Right Mouse Button for my selection

113
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,600
and you will too, you will get used to it over time, don't worry about that.

114
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Now this 3D Cursor itself can be

115
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
a bit of a pain to control. Now there are a couple of ways of putting it

116
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,600
back in the center, if you wanted it in the center. Oviously when I'm clicking here it's

117
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,600
kind of randomly appearing in space. It is rather clever if I go

118
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,600
and click on this cube, it will actu...left click on that cube,

119
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,600
it will actually place the 3D Cursor on the face of that cube, and we will

120
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,600
go more into vertices, edges, and faces later on. But now

121
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
it's actually on the surface of that cube, on that particular face facing us.

122
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,600
So we may want to put that back in the middle.

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,266
Well we can do a View and go to

124
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:04,500
Align View, and we can Center

125
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,500
the Cursor and View All.  Now that can be quite

126
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,500
useful, but not as useful as just moving the cursor,

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,500
it depends on what you're trying to do. So we can see there that Shift and C will do that,

128
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,500
so let's give that a go! Shift and C, excellent! So we

129
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,500
see it's moved the Viewpoint, which may be undesirable, um, but we

130
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,500
can now see everything as well. So we've zoomed in all the way over here, let's see.

131
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Ah, this is a great example! See that, I've just

132
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,500
run out of zoom. I'm moving the scroll wheel like ra, crazy,

133
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
and I've run out of zoom. And this is a common question I get asked all the time,

134
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
I'm so glad it's happened to me right now. See if that does happen,

135
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,500
you need to kind of reset your zoom level. So in order to do that,

136
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,500
we can go View and then just View Selected.

137
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,500
That's the easiest way out of this, that's the way I

138
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,500
work with it. And then you can see there, the number pad full stop will get you there. So if I hit

139
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
number pad full stop, we then focus on the selected item.

140
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Now, let's go ahead and go Shift and C, and we can see,

141
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
we zoom back out, we can see the entire scene and this cursor

142
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,500
is centered. The other way of centering the cursor is to

143
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,500
use the Shift key with S. Shift and S

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,500
will give us, it's the Snapping menu, and it gives us an

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,500
option where to snap to. And here we have some options

146
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,500
for the cursor. So we've got Cursor to Selected, Cursor

147
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,500
to Center, Cursor to Grid, and Cursor to Active. So if I

148
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
go Cursor to Active, it will move the cursor to the

149
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
active object. You know what I was saying earlier? If we select more than one

150
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,500
item... Oh, that's not a great selection order, let's do it that way around.

151
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Now the Lamp is the active icon. If I go Shift

152
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,500
S and Cursor to Active, it

153
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,500
will move to the active object. In fact, it moves to where this little orange

154
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,500
spot is, which is called the Origin, on every particular

155
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,500
object. The other options there, we've got Cursor

156
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
to Grid, so it's going to align it with the grid. If we were to look

157
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,500
down on our model, in Perspective, we can see that it's gone

158
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,500
to the closest possible grid, the whole number it can go

159
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,500
to. So if we go 1, 2, 3, it's gone to the 4th one along

160
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,500
in the X direction, which is this red arrow here.

161
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,500
What else have we got under there? Shift and S, Cursor to Center!

162
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,500
OK, so Cursor to Center will move it to the

163
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,500
center of the scene, where X, Y, and the blue line that you can't see,

164
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Z, equals 0, and that is very powerful! You'll

165
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
want to properly generate a lot of objects at the center of your scene.

166
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Now one final thing, the

167
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
what is it, Cursor to Selected! Now this is a

168
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,500
kind of an odd one, because when you've got more than one object selected,

169
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
it's going to put it in the middle of them all. So now

170
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
we try that, it should end up where the 3D Manipulator Widget, this

171
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,500
little white ball with multi-colored arrows coming out of it.

172
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
If we go Shift and S and move the cursor to selected, we see that it's

173
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,500
gone to the average position of the objects that we

174
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,533
have selected, and that is very powerful as well, because that

175
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,333
is how you can place something directly in the middle of two particular

176
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,466
objects.

177
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:33,466
And that is essentially the purpose of the 3D Cursor, at least

178
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:37,466
in the early stages. We're going to use the 3D Cursor to tell Blender

179
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:41,466
where we want to place objects, and that is very

180
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:45,466
powerful, having the ability to just move it around anywhere that we

181
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:46,533
want.

182
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:50,000
So another useful thing to know is where things are in the menu, and I try

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and give you guys the menu options, so you can

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
physically see where they're situated. Most of them are logically placed,

185
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,633
but the 3D Cursor, the movement of it is...

186
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:05,633
This is one of these things that's doesnt quite, it's not quite intuitive, because

187
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,400
it's not an object yet. It's part of the Snapping

188
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:12,366
menu, which is underneath the Objects menu. So if we go to Objects

189
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:16,366
on the 3D Editor Header Bar, and then, go to Snap which is

190
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:20,366
just about a third of the way up, a quarter of the way up there and then we get the

191
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:24,366
same options we had before. And of course, you can see that the shortcut

192
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:28,366
keys there is Shift and S, and that's where this menu comes from.

193
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:32,366
Brilliant! So now that we've gone over here, I have a small

194
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,466
challenge for you.

195
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:39,366
OK, so your challenge is to practice selecting objects,

196
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:43,366
select multiple objects, select individual objects, get the hang

197
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:47,366
and the knak of doing that. Try right clicking

198
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,366
and moving those objects as well, see how that pans out. Now your not going to have

199
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:55,366
much control at the moment, but don't worry that's not the point. At the moment, we're just

200
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:59,366
trying to get you in the hang of using the Right Mouse Button to actually

201
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:03,366
select and then to move them as well.

202
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:07,366
Try moving around the 3D Cursor. Remember that's the Left Mouse

203
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:11,366
Button. Get used to the Right Mouse Button selection. That's

204
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:15,366
kind of the real crux of this particular lesson,

205
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:19,366
and remember the Left Mouse Button to apply the action.

206
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:23,366
So if you do move something with the Right Mouse Button, if you click the Right Mouse Button

207
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:27,366
again, practice that, that cancels the operation. Or if you

208
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:31,366
move it and you like the new location, hit the Left Mouse Button

209
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:35,366
to apply the action. So pause the video now and give that a go!

210
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:39,366
OK guys, welcome back!

211
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:43,366
Let's go through the challenge and see if we can do all of these things!

212
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,733
OK, so we're back over in Blender, and I've opened

213
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:50,733
up a default blend file, by going File and New,

214
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,733
so we've got everything back to how it is standard, if you were just opening

215
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:58,733
up Blender by yourself. Now that I've done that, we just need to practice

216
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,733
a few things. Practice selecting multiple objects was the first part of the

217
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:06,733
challenge, so I'm going to go ahead and click on the Camera.

218
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:10,733
Excellent! I'm also going to click on the Lamp. Brilliant!

219
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:14,733
And we can see it's highlighting that lighter orange color. Now,

220
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:18,733
when we select anything, we can also select things in the Outliner

221
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:22,733
itself, so we've got the Camera, the Cube, and the Lamp in the Outliner

222
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:25,233
over on the right-hand side here. And

223
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:29,966
and we can right click. No, we don't right click

224
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:33,966
over there, we left click over this side! So it can be a little bit confusing

225
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:37,966
remembering what to right click on and what to left click on. It's

226
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:41,966
essentially in the 3D View, you'll be right clicking to select things.

227
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:45,966
Now, we can select multiple things at the same time, by holding

228
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:49,966
down Shift and then right clicking on the various objects.

229
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:53,966
And we can see that all three have been selected, with the last one,

230
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:57,966
to be selected, being a lighter orange color. And that means it's the

231
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:01,966
Active Object. OK, remember the Active Object, because that's the thing

232
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:05,966
that things are going to apply to, are going to happen to if you start doing

233
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:09,966
any operations. Now, interestingly when you've got

234
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:13,966
everything selected, a lot of packages, when you then go to, let's

235
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:17,966
say, move them it will move them all at once

236
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:21,966
regardless of whether you've clicked on an individual item here or

237
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:25,966
in an empty space. Blender, however, is not quite like that. If I go

238
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,966
and right click on the Cube, after selecting everything, and try to move it, it

239
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:33,966
will move just the Cube. OK, so I can right click again

240
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:37,966
to reset that. If I want to move them all together,

241
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:41,966
I'll have to right click in an empty space and move them that way.

242
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:45,966
Of course, there are several other ways that you can move things. I can left click on this

243
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:49,966
manipulator widget here and move it along the various axis,

244
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:53,966
that I want to move it along. That's absolutely fine, there's lots of ways of doing

245
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:57,966
something so don't worry about that! So moving the 3D Cursor.

246
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:01,966
Well to move the 3D Cursor, you just left click. Now

247
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:05,966
interestingly, when you left click on a particular object, it will actually

248
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,966
snap the 3D Cursor to the face of that object. So if I go

249
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:13,966
ahead, this cube here, if I go and left click on that top

250
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:17,966
face there, when we zoom in we see that it's actually snapped bang

251
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:21,966
on the top face. Now it's not going to the middle of that top face or anything along those lines,

252
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:25,966
we'll learn how to do that later, but suffice it to say, it's easy to

253
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:29,966
put things together, if you can control the 3D Cursor like that. So we just left

254
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:33,966
click everywhere. Now it's going to take you a while to get

255
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:37,966
your head around the left click, right click, thing. It does make sense, it is

256
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:41,966
incredibly powerful, however, it will probably take you a couple of weeks

257
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:45,966
of using Blender, before you've stopped left clicking to select things,

258
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:49,966
because it's so habitual with every other bit of software. So do

259
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:53,966
get used to, over the coming lectures, etc., get used to the

260
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:57,966
Right Mouse Button for the selection and starting an

261
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:01,966
action like moving something about, and then, left clicking to apply

262
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:05,966
that action. OK guys, you've done great!

263
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:09,966
Well done! And I will see you in the next lecture!
