1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,733
OK, so let's go through what's coming up, so you get an idea

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:07,733
of the course itself! So the course structure, what are we going to do? Well the

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:11,733
first section is going to be designed for complete beginners. So

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,733
if you already have experience, you may want to skip ahead

5
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:19,733
but I generally don't recommend it. You might still find the beginning of this content

6
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:23,733
useful. I've asked some experienced people, ones who have been perhaps playing with

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:27,733
Blender on and off for a couple of years, and the feedback in general has been, oh

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:31,733
even though I've used Blender for a while, I didn't know that thing existed. So it's

9
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:35,733
wortwhile just watching, but bear with it, if you are experienced it may seem

10
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,733
a little basic at first. And it is basic because it's just code

11
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,733
with, is to help people cope with Blender, when they first approach it

12
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:47,733
afresh. Remember you can speed up and slow down

13
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:51,733
videos. There's a little toggle where you can make it go up to 2 times quicker,

14
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:55,733
so you can very quickly scrub through these early videos, if you need to.

15
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:59,733
So the learning journey itself! We're really focused on making sure

16
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:03,733
you guys have a very progressive learning journey. So we aim

17
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:07,733
to give you a breadth of knowledge across Blender. Every

18
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,733
lesson will focus on one key area of Blender, or

19
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,733
sometimes not Blender; sometimes it's just how to design, how to organize

20
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:19,733
but we tend to focus just on one thing at a time, so you guys can

21
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:23,733
stay focused essentially. Lessons will build on one another,

22
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:27,733
so often later, especially later on in the course, you'll find that you'll be using

23
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:31,733
a lot of your prior knowledge, and that tends to not be

24
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:35,733
retaught over and over again. It does in the early sections but later on,

25
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:39,733
we'll just use those skills that we've learned. Because of

26
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:43,733
this, because of the progressive nature, I would not recommend skipping lectures,

27
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:47,733
because it's very easy to miss something and then

28
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,733
go, oh well how do I do this? So do go through each one individually, and if you

29
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:55,733
get it then, of course, move on! So one of the big things

30
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:59,733
that we get, early on in the course, is there are lots of different ways of

31
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:03,733
doing things in Blender, it's a very versatile package. So there's

32
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:07,733
always multiple paths to the same outcome, and it's important

33
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:11,733
to realize that there isn't a right way. As long as you get

34
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,733
to the destination point and you've completed, let's say, a challenge

35
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,733
I give you guys, then that's it! You've completed it, that's brilliant!

36
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:23,733
My way is not always necessarily the quickest or the way that you're

37
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:27,733
going to choose. So don't see my way as the all seeing all knowing

38
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:31,733
way, there are always multiple ways of doing it. And often, I'll be using

39
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:35,733
the skills we've just learned in that lecture, even if there's another skill

40
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:39,733
I could use in order to complete the challenge as well.

41
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,733
If you have another route, share with everybody your experience. So

42
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:47,733
there are multiple ways of doing things, and learning about all the different ones

43
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:51,733
is valuable for absolutely everyone, so please share when you

44
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:55,733
do that. Now, you'll see these green slides throughout the course. These are

45
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:59,733
challenge slides. Now, most lectures will have these challenge

46
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:03,733
slides in them, and these challenges are important, they really hone your knowledge, they make

47
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:07,733
sure that what you've just been taught you can actually apply.

48
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:11,733
And often it's worthwhile going through and trying out

49
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,733
some more things, using the skills you've just learned.

50
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:19,733
Challenges will focus on specifically what has been learned in that

51
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,733
lecture, and it will incorporate earlier

52
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:27,733
knowledge too, more so as we progress through the course.

53
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:31,733
Now, please please share your work! Be proud of it! When you first

54
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:35,733
start something afresh, it's very intimidating when you're surrounded with

55
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:39,733
people that are better than you at something. Now don't worry

56
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:43,733
about that, we all start from somewhere, and we all start from 0, if we've

57
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:47,733
not used Blender or anything else in our lives. So just remember to

58
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:51,733
be proud of it! I love seeing you guys develop and I want to see you

59
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:55,733
start building things out of cubes and cylinders and putting it together,

60
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:59,733
And then, in a few weeks time, you're building wonderful models! And that will happen,

61
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,733
just stay with it, be proud of your work, and remember to share it!

62
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:07,733
And do make the challenge your own! So I might ask you to make...

63
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:11,733
And I will do in a few lectures time, a simple block-work

64
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:15,733
plane. And I know some people have taken this challenge on their own, and instead of

65
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:19,733
making a very simple plane, they've taken the knowledge they've learned so far and they've

66
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:23,733
made some wonderful examples of aviation models. So

67
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:27,733
it's absolutely wonderful seeing what you guy are doing! Go above and beyond the challenge

68
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,133
whenever you can. Push yourself and you will be surprised

69
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:34,466
you will be surprised with what you'll be able to do!

70
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:38,466
So let's move on now to the next lecture!
