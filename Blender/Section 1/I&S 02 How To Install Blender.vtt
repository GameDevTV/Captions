00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Hi and welcome to How to Install Blender!

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.800
So in this particular video, we'll be going to where to download Blender

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.800
from, so you get the official copy. We'll be installing Blender

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.800
to the computer. We'll be checking which version you have as well,

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.800
so if you've already got it installed, we'll be able to see which version that

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.800
is and see whether you need to get the latest version. Now, the latest version at the moment,

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.800
at the recording time of this video, is 2.77. So you're going to need

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.800
version 2.77 or later, to make sure that what I'm doing and what

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.800
you're doing are going to match up and correlate. Now, it's very important,

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.800
as I go through these, that you're focused on what I am

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.800
doing. That can be very difficult to follow a screen and

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.800
not having to pause the video every 2 seconds. I tend to talk quite

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.800
slowly, especially in these early lectures you so guys can follow what's going

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.800
on clearly. But it is a great idea to watch the video, and

15
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.800
then, I'm going to give you a challenge. And when I give you the challenge, then of course

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.800
if necessary, you can go back and pause and come back and forth and back and forth. That's

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.800
absolutely fine! But I would recommend actually just watching these first

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.800
few minutes, so that you guys can see what's going to happen, and then, when the

19
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.800
challenge comes, of course, go ahead and do it! So let's go ahead,

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.133
first of all, and see where to download Blender from. OK,

21
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.700
so I have opened up a browser and gone to

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.700
www.blender.org. And here, there are a couple of places

23
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.700
you could go to. You could go to the Download link at the top or the big blue Download

24
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700
button down here. Blender 2.77! So if I go ahead

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.700
and click on that, it takes us to the Download page. So we've got www.blender.org

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.700
/download. If I scroll down this page,

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.700
we can see that the latest was released only a few days ago. Well,

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.700
it's now the 22nd and it was March 19th, so brilliant! This is a new version for me as

29
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.700
well, so we get to do a live install! Nothing can go wrong here, hey guys!

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.700
So if we scroll down, we can see the versions for Windows

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.700
there, and we can see the version for Mac. And if we scroll down a little more,

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
we've got Mm for Linux as well. So you'll need to pick the version

33
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700
that's applicable to your platform. I'm running a Mac, as you'll probably notice

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.700
here, and I'll be going through soon the similarities and differences between these

35
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.700
particular platforms. Most of the time there are no differences,

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.700
just a different keyboard layout basically. OK, so I'm going to go

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.700
ahead and click on one of these links, and that's going to start downloading!

38
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.700
Now, it's great that this says it right in front of us, what I was going to say!

39
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.700
Blender is free software and it's free to use for any purposes.

40
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.700
Now the great thing about it is, it' really just a, it is a suit

41
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.700
of packages. It's a 3D modeling package, it's a sculpting package, it's

42
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.700
a compositor, it's a renderer! It does so much! It does VFX, it does

43
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.700
animation! There's pretty much nothing it can't do. So it's wonderful

44
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.700
and it's a great tool to use, and I'm really excited and really looking forward to seeing

45
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.700
what you guys can create with it, as well. So let's just have a look and

46
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.700
see at the features, while we're just waiting for this to download here. Now,

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.700
it's going to take you a while to get to this level here, even with this orange, lemon, and

48
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.700
lime on there. This photorealistic rendering, fast modeling, realistic

49
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.700
materials, fast rigging, animation, all of these things are absolutely

50
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.700
wonderful! And I must hammer it home, at this point, that you

51
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.700
guys are going to get the most out of this course, when you put the most in.

52
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.700
Now, I'm not going to be able to teach you every little nitty gritty thing, but I will be

53
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.700
teaching you the basics, all the way up to some more advanced stuff. But I would

54
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.700
really like it if you guys would take it upon yourselves to,

55
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.700
after a particular section has finished or even after a particular lecture has

56
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.700
finished, you practice that skill that we've just learned because that is really

57
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.700
important. There is no substitution for repetition. The mother

58
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.700
of all skill is repetition. So if after I asked

59
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.700
you to model, let's say a kitchen cup, we'll go out and make

60
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.700
a plate and a bowl, you know nice simple things. Don't go out of your way to go make

61
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.700
a car or a plane. I mean those are great things to model,

62
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.700
but a cup may be one or two parts, a plane or a car might be

63
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.700
hundreds of parts to make that. So let's make things nice and simple

64
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.700
for ourselves and make sure we can win. If we set ourselves a challenge, let's make sure we

65
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.700
can win that challenge. OK, I've noticed so now that the download has finished.

66
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.700
I'm going to go ahead and click on that download, and it's going

67
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.700
to extract, which is absolutely fine. And then, I'm going to go ahead

68
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.700
and drag the folder to my

69
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.700
Applications. It will be slightly different on a

70
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.700
PC or a Linux Box. I can't see Applications. There it is! OK,

71
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.700
so now that's in my Applications. I'm going to go find it and just create a shortcut on

72
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.700
my computer for it, so I can come back to it at any time.

73
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.700
OK, so let's go ahead and open that! Oh, it appears I already have an

74
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.700
instance of it open! So let's go ahead and open!

75
00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:59.600
Now, of course, you may get a security warning

76
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.600
on any platform, when you first open up a file. Of course, if we've downloaded

77
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.600
it from Blender.org, I'm absolutely happy with that, so I'm going to Open

78
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.600
that up. And we're presented with this splash screen in front of us, which quite

79
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.600
clearly says Blender 2.77! However, if you're a bit click

80
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.600
happy, I tend to be occasionally, you may have that disappear,

81
00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:23.100
but that's not to worry, because we can still see the version number. It's

82
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.100
right in front of us. If we look at the very top of Blender, we

83
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.100
have this particular bar here that's called the Info

84
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.100
Window. We'll use that in a future lecture, or lots of future lectures, because

85
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.100
it's where you have File, new, open, open recent, all those sort

86
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.100
of familiar things you're used to. You'll notice that you don't have a

87
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.100
File, Edit, Tools menu and all those other things that you would generally have with

88
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.100
a program. Now this is the same across all platforms, so

89
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.100
this is great! It means you can switch from a Mac to a PC, and have to learn nothing

90
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.100
new. It's great! Now, if we go all the way along this bar,

91
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.100
we can see it says version 2.77, which is great!

92
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.100
And we can go ahead and click on the little Blender icon there and it'll open up this splash

93
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.100
screen again. So there we go, we've got the version. We've got it

94
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.066
installed on the computer, and of course, I've got a challenge for you!

95
00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:17.800
OK, I'd like you to go ahead and install

96
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.800
Blender. So go to www.glender.org

97
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.800
/download/ Download the latest version of Blender.

98
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.800
Now, of course, I'm using 2.77 in this particular video,

99
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.800
but the versions of Blender tend to iterate relatively quickly, so

100
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.800
you might be on 2.8 by the time you've watched this video. Don't worry,

101
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.800
that will be the latest version of Blender. Install it

102
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.800
on your computer. So this is going to be one of these lectures now where I'm not

103
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.800
going to ask you to pause the video. I will simply let you go ahead and

104
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.800
install it on your computer, and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
