00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,533
Welcome to

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:06,533
Where to Find Support! So help others to help

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:10,533
you, that is a very critical starting point. We have a very

4
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:14,533
supportive community, so asking them for help is

5
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,533
great! That's what we're all here to help you out with! Start the conversation.

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,533
So if you see someone's asking for help, but you don't quite know

7
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:26,533
how to help them, just starting that conversation itself

8
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:30,533
can help answer the question, because they'll start trying things. Perhaps they got a bit

9
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:34,533
of a mental block, and it just helps them going. As you become more

10
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:38,533
Experienced yourself, you can help others, too. Now, of course, you're probably

11
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:42,533
thinking at this point, hang on a minute, Mike, you're the instructor! Can't you just answer

12
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:46,533
all the questions? Well I would really love to, but I think there are now

13
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:50,533
something like 22,000 of you students and 1 of me.

14
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:54,533
So there's only so much I can do in a day, of course, and

15
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,533
you guys can get back to each other really quckly, whereas it's going to take

16
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:02,533
me a bit longer to do so. So helping each other out is

17
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:06,533
also a very good way of learning yourself.

18
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:10,533
Becoming a teacher is often one of the best ways of learning a particular

19
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:14,533
topic. Of course, I am always around to help, but it may take some

20
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:18,533
time, in order to get back to any queries that you've got.

21
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:22,533
Now remember, asking a good question,

22
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:26,533
you'll get a good answer. So be specific about

23
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:30,533
your issue. If you go ahead and say, help I can't get it

24
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:34,533
to work! Well we know from that that you need help

25
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:38,533
and you can't get something to work, but we don't know what. So it is

26
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:42,533
very important, that if you're going to ask a question, that you ask a

27
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:46,533
specific question. Help, I'm having problems with

28
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:50,533
this particular thing not working, and

29
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:54,533
tell us what you've tried so far. I know when I've asked for help,

30
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:58,533
it can feel a bit irritating when someone asks

31
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:02,533
me, have you tried switching your computer on and off again. Because that does solve

32
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:06,533
a lot of problems, but of course, if I've already tried that,

33
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:10,533
I'll say yes yes I've already tried that. But that question would never have been

34
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:14,533
asked back if I'd said, well I've got this issue with Blender not doing X,

35
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:18,533
and I've tried restarting the computer and reopening my

36
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:22,533
Blender file and it's still doing it. Now I'm not going to get asked to switch switch

37
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:26,533
the computer off and on again. Remember you can

38
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:30,533
edit your discussions, to your question, to add further things you have

39
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:34,533
tried, rather than asking more and more questions going on. And

40
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:38,533
include a picture of the issue. Now, it's very true that

41
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,533
a picture speaks 1,000 words, so if you include a

42
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:46,533
picture, it can often give us a clue as to what's

43
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,533
going on, even if you think it's to do with X, Y, Z. And remember to include the full

44
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:54,533
screen with the outliner. It's very tempting to crop a tiny

45
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:58,533
bit of the screen out, but often it's better if we can see everything that's on

46
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:02,533
the screen. And remember, you can go to the very top of Blender and make the screenshot

47
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:06,533
there, which will include everything. Ask questions

48
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:10,533
in the Q & A. Udemy have changed around their system,

49
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:14,533
somewhat recently, and it's very useful if we're answering

50
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:18,533
questions in the Q & A, cause that's how it's all been setup to

51
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:22,533
work, I suppose. And if you want to share your work,

52
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:26,533
the best place to do it is to come over to our community, because

53
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:30,533
it's such a rich experience over there. And you can see the address there.

54
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:34,533
There's http://community.gamedev.tv!

55
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:38,533
And we've already got many students coming over there. It's

56
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:42,533
much much more fluid. You can see pictures, you can see other people's

57
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:46,533
work. So much easier than it is trolling through the Udemy Q & A's,

58
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:50,533
which are for questions and answers. So it also feels a bit odd sharing your

59
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:54,533
work as a question, and it's also very confusing because, sometimes

60
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:58,533
I look at people's work, and it's lovely to see your work, and I'm

61
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:02,533
thinking well have they got a question about it? And sometimes if there's no question

62
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,533
or it's a bit ambiguous, you end up starting a dialog and there's nothing actually wrong,

63
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:10,533
there's no answer required. So have an answer for something?

64
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:14,533
If you have solved your issue, when you've asked a question, do

65
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:18,533
let us know, because that's important to know how you solved it

66
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:22,533
as well. So tell us how you overcame the challenge that

67
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:26,533
you faced. It's very important, because that's going to help not only going to help us improve the

68
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:30,533
content, if it's something systemic with the actual lesson itself,

69
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:34,533
but it's also very useful for other students as well, if they come

70
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:38,533
across a similar issue. If you have solved

71
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:42,533
it, it is always useful to use a little [Solved] prefix itself

72
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,533
in the discussion or question title, so that people, if they've

73
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:50,533
asked that question themselves, can see straight away that there is a proposed solution

74
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:54,533
to the problem that they're having if they are searching for a similar

75
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:58,533
problem as to what you had. An example question, just to

76
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:02,533
get the ball rolling, just so you can think about it. So you might say [Question],

77
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,533
I've got a snapping problem. So

78
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:09,533
it's very helpful for me if you list a time for

79
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:13,533
referencing something in the video. So let's say in the snapping video

80
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:17,533
at 3:32, when you use the Snapping

81
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:21,533
Tool, I cannot see how... So fill in the rest of that

82
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:25,533
there. And then, of course, you may want to say I have tried doing X, Y, and Z

83
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:29,533
but unfortunately to no joy. Here is a

84
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:33,533
picture of the issue, etc. etc. You get the idea behind this.

85
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,533
This is a very good question, because it's actually going to help me

86
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:41,533
understand what you're trying to do because you've referenced the time. It's

87
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,533
tells us what you've tried already, so I don't go ahead and give you instructions that you

88
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:49,533
may have already tried, and a picture, of course, may highlight what the actual problem

89
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:50,833
is.

90
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,300
So in summary, where to go! Well if you've got

91
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,300
a question that's specific to the lecture that you've been watching,

92
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,300
then please use the Udemy Q & A's, that's what they're now designed for.

93
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,300
They used to be called discussions. You'll hear sharing the discussions a lot,

94
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,300
and if we want you to do that, it would be best not to share in the

95
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Udemy Q & A anymore because it's kind of odd posting

96
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,300
work as a question. And it also helps us manage what

97
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,300
questions we actually need to get to and answer. So if you do want to

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,300
share your work, and I'd like to invite you over to our community

99
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,300
at https://community.gamedev.tv/ This is a wonderful place

100
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,300
where you can share your work. It's really easy and accessible to see

101
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,300
all the work as well. It also does what we call Sketch Fab embeds,

102
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,300
which you'll see later on in the course as well. So if you've got a specific

103
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,300
question, ask it in the Udemy Q & A's,

104
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,300
especially if it's against a particular lecture that helps us help you. And it also,

105
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,300
helps us modify the course itself, if we get a series of questions

106
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,000
that are all very similar in nature.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,733
If you want to

108
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:01,733
share your work then, then come over to https://community.gamedev.tv//

109
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:05,733
And of course, we've got the Facebook group as well, and you're more than welcome to

110
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:09,733
come and share your work and then join in the discussions over there. And that's

111
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:13,733
https://www.facebook.com/groups/blendercourse/

112
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,733
So those are two places you can go to share and contribute your work,

113
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:21,733
especially if you're doing stuff outside. I love seeing what you guys are coming up with. And

114
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,733
of course, if you've got a lecture specific question, then of course answer it,

115
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:29,733
ask it or answer it as well [Laughs] in the Udemy Q & A's.

116
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:33,733
That's it for now and I will see you guys in the next lecture!
