Would you like to learn how to make 3D models? I'm Michael Bridges, a

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.200
professional tutor and 3D artist. And I'm Ben Tristem, one of Udemy's

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.200
top instructors, and together we're going to bring you the Complete Blender Creator,

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.200
where you're going to learn to make 3D models for VR, for computer games,

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.200
for designing your dream home, or for simply expressing yourself as

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.200
a 3D artist. So, Mikey, how are we going to start them with Blender?

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.200
So, we're going to get over the big hurdle which is the interface. It's an amazing

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.200
program but getting into it can be difficult, and before long, you'll be

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.200
making your 3D models. We're going to start with some block models. As you can see

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.200
here they're really simple, that gets you into the essence of what Blender's all about!

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.200
Absolutely, and moving on from there we're going to take a step up and take a look at texturing

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.200
and at mathematically precise shapes, something called a Bezier Curve. Look at this

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.200
wonderful bowling pin here and the bowling ball, being put together by beginners into

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200
a fantastic scene. You'll be doing that within just a few hours! Then moving on to a low

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.200
poly chess set, where you'll really refine your knowledge of materials and block modeling.

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.200
So, So Mikey, what do they go onto from there? Well, that's all static, a bit

17
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.200
boring, so we're going to start bringing things alive, with an animated lamp!

18
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.200
So, we're going to go through the process of rigging and actually making this thing

19
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.200
come alive. And then, we're moving onto a fluffy bunny, so we're going to explore

20
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.200
how to use hair and particle systems, and more on from there.

21
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.900
Then we are going to Game

22
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.900
Asset Pack where you are going to learn how to structure a more complex

23
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
project and also take a much deeper dive into textures,

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.900
normal maps and much more.  After that we'll

25
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
hop striaght into a human head, with organic

26
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.900
modelling, much more detailed mesh topology and finally

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
a really detailed guide into materials

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.633
relfecting those of the real world.

29
00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:45.633
how to use hair and particle systems, and more on from there.

30
00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:49.633
Fantastic! So the world is just crying out for 3D assets right now! We need it for

31
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:53.633
games, for Virtual Reality, for 3D printing, and for more. So,

32
00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:57.633
please don't take our word for it, take a look at all of our fantastic reviews! It's a great

33
00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:01.066
time to get into 3D modeling! Buy this course now!
