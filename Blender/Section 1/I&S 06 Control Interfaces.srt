00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to Control Interfaces!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video we're going to talk about keyboards, mice, and the general

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
interface that Blender has, as well. So first of all keyboards! Well

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
if you have a Mac then the F keys on your

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Mac, at the top, F1, F2, F3, etc., you're going to have to hold

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
down the Function button, wherever it be. On a laptop it's usually on the

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
lower-left of your keyboard. If you've got a full

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
size keyboard, it's above the cursor keys in the middle. So that's something

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to remember. And also, it's not only Macs that suffer from this, some

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
laptops also require the Function (Fn) key now to control those

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
F numbers at the top. And those are used throughout Blender, if you decide

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to use the keyboard shortcuts. Now on Linux,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the Alt key is used as a system key.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So whenever you see me holding down Alt and you

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
need to use that, you're probably going to have to hold down the Windows key at the

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
same time, in order for it to work as expected within Blender.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What happens if you've got no number pad? Well in a

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
moment we'll go over into Blender and enable Number Pad Emulation,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and I will show you what impact that has, because obviously you're going to lose

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
some other functionality the moment we do this. You will also find

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
on Macs and Linux, system keys sometimes override

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Blender shortcut keys, and Blender is really shortcut heavy.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So don't be surprised that if you use a shortcut key, that I show you, if you're on a

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Mac or Linux and it does something unexpected, not only to Blender but

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
perhaps the entire computer. So just bear that in mind, if you're using

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
those platforms. Let's talk about mice quickly! So

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I would strongly recommend a 3 button mouse.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We'll be going through how to use Blender without a 3 button mouse, so the

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
examples there would be if you're on a laptop. So you're going to be using a trackpad

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
a padldle maybe, even a stylus as well, so there's lots of options there for

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
us. I still highly recommend a 3 button mouse and a full size

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
keyboard, wherever possible. Later on you may,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
if you've not got one already, you may consider a stylus if you're

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
really into Blender and you want to start doing more artwork. All of these

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
things are just different tools for us to do our work with, and a stylus is

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
really good for drawing and sketching and things like that. And a mouse is a bit

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
crude when it comes to that, but for everything else we do in Blender, a normal 3 button

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
mouse will be absolutely fine. Blender's visuals!

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well we're going to go through Blender and see that you can change the appearance of

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Blender, which is very powerful. You can personalize the interface, and

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
make it easier for you to see. Not everybody's got 20/20 vision and

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Blender gives us, because of its unique interface, it gives us

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
a unique opportunity to just completely change how it looks.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So now we've gone over that! Let's go explore these things and hop on over

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,200
into Blender!

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,233
OK, so we're over in the Default layout, which

47
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:05,233
is generally the first thing that you're going to see, when you first start up Blender. It may look slightly

48
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:09,233
different, depending on the screen size that you're using. So first of all, we'll

49
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:13,233
deal with the keyboard itself. If you're using a laptop or even a smaller

50
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:17,233
keyboard, you're going to be missing the number pad on the side.

51
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:21,233
Now the number keys across the top of your keyboard, the 1,

52
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:25,233
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 those actually control

53
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:29,233
the layout options in Blender. Now,

54
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:33,233
what we're going to be doing is sacrificing that ability for the

55
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:37,233
ability of moving around our model, which is in my

56
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:41,233
opinion more powerful especially early on. So the numbers

57
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:45,233
across the top of the keyboard change layer, and we can see

58
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:49,233
on the Header Bar, down here for the 3D View, these...

59
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:53,233
I don't know how many there are. There are 20 boxes or so of the

60
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,233
layers that you can work on. So you can work on multiple layers and keep things separate

61
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:01,233
from one another and turn them on and off, it's very very powerful. And since

62
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,600
the option is down there,

63
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,833
it won't disrupt you too much

64
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,833
if you lose the ability to hit the numbers across the top of the

65
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,833
screen. Often it's better to check down here anyway and see which layer you

66
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,833
want to work on, and we'll go through layers much later on in the course.

67
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,833
So the number pad itself enables us to move around our model,

68
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,300
by pressing on the number pad, the various numbers, we can see

69
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,533
the various numbers. We can see it's moving

70
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:30,533
around our model in various ways and changing the view,

71
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:34,533
which is very powerful. And of course, if you've not got a

72
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:38,533
number pad, it'd be best if we setup the numbers at the top. And the way that we do this

73
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:42,533
is, go to the File menu on the Info Header and scroll

74
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,533
down to where you see User Preferences. Now this area, I will

75
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:50,533
warn you, you can edit pretty much eveything to do with Blender,

76
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:54,533
so make sure if you do make a change, it is a change

77
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:58,533
you want to make. So let's go in and open it up!

78
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:02,533
So we've got the Blender User Preferences in front of us, and we want to go to

79
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:06,533
Input. And on the left-hand side we can see

80
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:10,533
that we have Emulate Numberpad about halfway

81
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:14,533
down, and if we click on that, it simply changes the numbers along the

82
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:19,233
top of your keyboard, so that they work as the number pad, which is very very

83
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:20,566
powerful.

84
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,900
And you can also use this feature, the plus and minus will help you zoom

85
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,900
in and out, if you don't have a 3 button mouse,

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,466
which we'll move on now as

87
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,566
we're in the preferences.

88
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,766
So I'm going to turn it off, because I have a number pattern,

89
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:39,766
I'm used to using that. So I'm going to turn on now Emulate

90
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:43,766
3 Button Mouse and we'll explore how that works. And I'm

91
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:47,766
going to make sure I Save the User Settings. That is important.,

92
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:51,766
if we don't save the user settings, it won't remember what you've done. I'm going to

93
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:55,766
close down the Blender Interface there. So now that I've done that, I'm going to

94
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:59,766
move over. I have got a 3 button mouse, but it's attached to my MacBook so I can

95
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:03,766
now use the Trackpad, in order to control things. Now, it will

96
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:07,766
vary from computer to computer as to what you can do by standard.

97
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:11,766
So on a Mac, for instance, the trackpad is rather good, so that

98
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:15,766
does enable you to use two fingers and

99
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:19,766
rotate around your model. Now, your Windows or Linux

100
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:23,766
machine may also do the same. It also allows this pinch to zoom operation,

101
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:27,766
so I'm just moving my fingers in and out and that

102
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:31,766
zooms in and out. Now if I want to pan to the left and right, I can

103
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,766
hold down Shift, whilst using two fingers, and we can see that pans

104
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:39,766
left and right. And using all of those together, we actually get

105
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,766
a reasonable result and quite a quick and easy method of use.

106
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:47,766
However, if your trackpad only supports

107
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:51,766
clicking, and it's not got all these multi-touch things, you can still

108
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:55,766
use the actual system, it's absolutely fine. You simply hold,

109
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:59,766
once that emulate is turned on and you've saved your settings, you can hold down Alt.

110
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:03,766
And this is the screencast key for Alt there. And when you

111
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:07,766
left click, that enables you to orbit around your

112
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:11,766
model. Great! How do we pan?

113
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:15,766
Well, we continue holding down Alt and we hold down Shift and then we can click

114
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:19,766
and pan left and right. So that is really really

115
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:23,766
powerful! Now let's have a look at what would happen

116
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:27,766
if you wanted to change the interface, how it actually looks. And some

117
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:31,766
people will want to do this, so it's higher contrast, so it's easier to see, easier to

118
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:35,766
work on. And once again, you can go to File, User Preferences,

119
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:39,766
and this time we're going to go to the Themes.

120
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:43,766
And this gives us a load of Presets and we can change the colors everywhere.

121
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:47,766
So if we go to this Presets section, we can see there are loads of different

122
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:51,766
options, and Flatty Light is one that I

123
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:55,766
quite enjoy. It really does boost the contrast and make the screen easy

124
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,766
to read. Now, I'm not going to use a special theme, because I want to make sure it

125
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:03,766
is as similar to the default state as possible, as we're going

126
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:07,766
through. But one of the other things you may want to do is, change the size of

127
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:11,766
the font, independently of the rest of the interface, and you can do that

128
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:15,766
over on the System Tab. Now we have this option here

129
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:19,766
that says DPI, and that allows us to scale the interface so you can make

130
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:23,766
the text smaller or you can make the text larger, and that's

131
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:27,766
completely independent of the window size itself. I'm going to set

132
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:31,766
that back to 72, and that's really powerful! If your eye sight's not that good,

133
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:35,766
you can enlarge the DPI of the application itself,

134
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,766
and that's also great because it doesn't effect the rest of your computer either. I mean, one

135
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:43,766
of the options would be to change the resolution of your screen but that's not ideal. This allows you to

136
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:47,766
actually scale the text up, so you can read it really easily. Obviously that's

137
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:51,766
too extreme for me, and I'm going to set that back to 72, which is the default.

138
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:55,766
So that gives us a great overview of what you can do to Blender's

139
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:59,766
interface, how you can customize it. And remember, it is your system, make

140
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:03,766
it your own. Make it as easy for you to use as possible.

141
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,600
Finally, any settings that you have changed, remember to Save your

142
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
User Settings, otherwise it won't come back next time. Now,

143
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
if you accidentally make a change that you don't [laughs] want to keep,

144
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
you may want to revert back to Blender's default state,

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
which you can do, it's in the File menu itself. If we scroll

146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
down here, let's see, Load Factory Settings. Now the

147
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
danger of loading factory settings is, it wipes all of the settings

148
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
you have setup, so you know, use this with caution.

149
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
And if you've spent a couple of years, let's say, using Blender and then you go

150
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
and use this, you're going to have a lot of setup time again. But if you're playing

151
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
about with Blender initially, trying to get a style you like, and you overwrite

152
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
the default startup file, which we can do here as well Save Startup File.

153
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Then, at any point, you can just click Load Factory Settings,

154
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Load Factory Settings, and we're back to there. And I've got this graphical glitch

155
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
again, so I'll just sort that out. There we go, we're back

156
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
to the Default layout! So that's very powerful that we can reset everything and

157
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,733
start again and play with it and enjoy it.

158
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:14,733
