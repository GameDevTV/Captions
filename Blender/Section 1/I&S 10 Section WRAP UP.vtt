00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.600
Congratulations

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.600
guys! Well done on mastering Blender's interface, and well done for

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.600
getting to the end of the first section! I know when I first mastered

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.600
Blender's interface it was amazing the sense of relief, as suddenly

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.600
there wasn't this how do I use this or what's all this bewildering stuff

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.600
going about! It's a great relief and congratulations getting this far!

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.600
OK, so what's next? Well first of all, I want to make

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.600
sure that you guys are in the habit of saving your work regularly, that's very important

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.600
and making sure you've got a descent folder structure on your computer.

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.600
So I would suggest, I'm not going to make you,

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600
I would suggest that you guys create a folder called Blender on

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.600
on your computer and perhaps in your documents, and in that

13
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.600
put Section 1, a folder for Section 1, and put all of the things you do in Section 1.

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.600
And then, when we move on to Section 2, 3, etc. make folders for that as well,

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.600
so you keep your work all in one place, so it's easy to find.

16
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.600
Now I'll also stress that Blender itself can be unstable at times, depending

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600
on your computer setup and everything else, so make sure you save regularly. And

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.600
make sure you've got a backup of your work as well, and then, we'll go into

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.600
details of how you can do that, in the next section. Speaking of the

20
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.600
next section, we're going to be jumping into it very shortly. I would ask

21
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.600
one final thing of you and that's that you remember to share your work.

22
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.600
It is so important, not only for me as a teacher to see how you guys are getting on,

23
00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.066
the other thing is it inspires not only myself

24
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:34.066
but the other students, the new ones coming to the course. If they can see

25
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:38.066
what they're getting themselves into, they're going to be excited and inspired to continue,

26
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.066
and that's what we want. We've got a community here that we want to bring together

27
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:46.066
and actually excel ourselves using Blender. So

28
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:50.066
what I'd like you to do now, without any hesitation, is actually jump straight

29
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:54.066
on into the next section. That is so important to just get in there and

30
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.066
continue on, and I will see you guys in that next section!

31
00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.433
Take care!
