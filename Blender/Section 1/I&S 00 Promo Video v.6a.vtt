Hi guys, welcome to this course on 3D modeling with

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Blender! Blender's a super powerful 3D modeling tool but

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it is not the easiest to get started or get to grips with, but please, it's worth it! And we're going to

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
make it easy, even for complete beginners? We certainly are! We've got a lot to go through

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and it's going to be super easy for anybody to get hold of. Now, I'm Michael,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
your primary instructor throughout this course and digital artist. And I'm Ben,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm one of Udemy's top instructors and I'm here to make sure this course is

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
perfect, in terms of the way that it teaches you to do this. So where...

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
How are we going to do it? How are we going to teach a complete beginner a complex package

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
like Blender? Well we've got 10 sections, thoroughly going through

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
from the very basics all the way through to some more advanced stuff. Now, where do we

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
start with that? Well we need to start with the interface, that's the tough nut to crack. So we'll

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
get you comfortable in Blender's interface, firstly, and then, move you straight on to block modeling,

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
where you're going to make the fundamental building blocks. Everything is really simple

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in this section, so we start building up our models from scratch. From there,

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you're going to move into a bowling pin. We've chosen that because it's curved, basically,

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and then you're going to be able to start making things that are rounded and are more interesting. From the bowling

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
pin, Mikey, where do we go? A lovely chess set and this is where we start integrating models

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
together, so we've got more than one model and the scene starts to get a bit more complicated and we also start

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
applying our first textures, too. And then, not wishing to rest on our laurels, we're going

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to go straight into an animated lamp. Think about that one from the famous

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
movie studio, and there you're going to learn about basic animation but also about other ways of

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
rendering and lighting your scene. Now we've got one of my favorite sections, a fluffy

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
bunny, where we learn about organic modeling and making and

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
using particle systems. Then, we're going to bring together practically everything you've learned, up to that

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
point, to make this beautiful gothic church scene.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's brilliant! And we take all of the knowledge we've got in that and start making a

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
human head. Now this is a big feat! It's where we start making realistic materials,

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the ultimate goal of any CG artist. Absolutely! From there,

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we're going to talk about physics, destruction, and defamation! You're going to be able to see how to get Blender to

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
calculate, for example, how a wall would fall apart if something hit it! Then, what?

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Well that's lots of fun but not as fun as VFX where we combine your CG

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
art, that you've already made, with a real world scene, real world footage

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
video. Brilliant, lots of fun! So now please, there's so much potential

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in Blender! It's a fantastic time really to learn 3D

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
modeling and 3D art! So please take this course with us now!

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.466
